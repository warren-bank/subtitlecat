( horn honking )

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,501
Well, now then,

3
00:00:14,502 --> 00:00:16,403
the great day dawns.

4
00:00:16,404 --> 00:00:17,972
Absolutely.
You know, Kilwillie,

5
00:00:17,973 --> 00:00:19,539
I have this
strange feeling.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,242
- Not ill, are you?
- Sweating palms, palpitations,

7
00:00:22,243 --> 00:00:23,911
inability to
concentrate,

8
00:00:23,912 --> 00:00:25,178
uncontrollable
shaking.

9
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:27,114
Nothing out of the ordinary there then.

10
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:28,983
Absolutely not!
Come on!

11
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:33,420
Ahh...

12
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:35,155
my beauty.

13
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:39,026
My Lagganmore Peculiar,
come home at last.

14
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:40,928
I've tried to take
care of her for you.

15
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:43,563
I'm very grateful. You'll
get a reward, don't worry.

16
00:00:43,564 --> 00:00:46,967
- Come on. It's almost time.
- Is it safe?

17
00:00:46,968 --> 00:00:50,337
Molly's out in the real world, no
sign of Archie at all. ( laughs )

18
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:53,306
<i>( bird calling )</i>

19
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:56,309
- What was that?
- What? What?

20
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,811
Come on!

21
00:00:57,812 --> 00:00:59,880
( liquid sloshing )

22
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:11,925
Gently!
Gently.

23
00:01:39,554 --> 00:01:41,454
Just think,

24
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:45,525
when you set this wondrous
malt aside to mature,

25
00:01:45,526 --> 00:01:47,394
all those years ago.

26
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:49,563
30 years ago
to the day.

27
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:51,165
30 years.

28
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,501
When I was
as debonair as Cary Grant,

29
00:01:54,502 --> 00:01:57,270
and my forehead
was a mass of golden curls.

30
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:58,505
That was a very
long time ago.

31
00:02:00,075 --> 00:02:01,108
Don't forget.

32
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:03,043
Not a word about this
to anyone,

33
00:02:03,044 --> 00:02:05,112
especially
you-know-who.

34
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:07,280
Just hold it right there.

35
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:11,451
Don't even think
about it!

36
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:16,924
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

37
00:02:57,298 --> 00:02:59,432
<i>Archie: so...</i>

38
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,034
is there anything special

39
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:02,936
about this Lagganmore Peculiar?

40
00:03:02,937 --> 00:03:05,939
You mean apart from being
extremely valuab-

41
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,242
nothing special at all!

42
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:10,510
If that's the case,
why are you being so shifty?

43
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:13,247
- Ah, fair point.
- Will you be quiet?

44
00:03:13,248 --> 00:03:15,816
Anyone would think you'd
drunk a pint of it already!

45
00:03:16,885 --> 00:03:18,618
Right.

46
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:21,789
I think I'm going to confiscate
this, pending further inquiries.

47
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,891
You can't, it's mine!
I'm head of the family!

48
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:26,960
And I am the laird. It's my
responsibility to make the most

49
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:29,163
of the estate's assets,
whatever they are.

50
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:31,398
Is nothing sacred?
You've flogged everything,

51
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:33,667
including most of my wine!
Finders keepers!

52
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:35,102
Losers weepers!

53
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:41,474
Possession is nine-tenths
of the law.

54
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:44,577
Whiskey's meant
for drinking, damn it!

55
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:47,047
I'm not gonna take this
lying down, Kilwillie,

56
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:48,816
oh, dear me, no.

57
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:51,785
Chocks away, chaps.

58
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:56,223
Have you seen this?

59
00:03:56,224 --> 00:03:57,925
<i>Lexie:
Don't tell me.</i>

60
00:03:57,926 --> 00:04:00,493
Queen Victoria has
just bought a bungalow

61
00:04:00,494 --> 00:04:02,462
in a place
called Balmoral?

62
00:04:02,463 --> 00:04:05,332
If we don't stop
Archie doing this,

63
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,400
you and me
are finished, son.

64
00:04:09,603 --> 00:04:11,571
But, Golly,
we've known for ages

65
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:14,842
that Archie was gonna hire another
sad schmuck to work in here.

66
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:16,710
That was to run
the visitor center.

67
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:17,978
This is
something else.

68
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:19,079
"Head Ranger"?

69
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,547
Head Ranger.

70
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:22,082
Seems to me
that title

71
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,717
carries certain
implications.

72
00:04:23,718 --> 00:04:26,186
Yeah, like he's
gonna head...

73
00:04:26,187 --> 00:04:28,856
well...
the ranges.

74
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:31,391
<i>Those ranges
are mine...</i>

75
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:33,626
and have been for the last 20 years.

76
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,598
This is the end
of the old order.

77
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:39,867
Maybe me with it.

78
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:41,701
Oh, Golly,
don't be daft.

79
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:43,470
You'd better
believe it, lass.

80
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:45,973
He's got
to be stopped.

81
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:47,941
Well, as long as you
don't expect any help

82
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:49,709
<i>from Albert Einstein there.</i>

83
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:52,612

84
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:55,548
<i>Golly: Duncan!</i>

85
00:04:55,549 --> 00:04:57,885
Do you not realise
how serious this is?

86
00:04:57,886 --> 00:05:00,354
Our whole future's
under threat here.

87
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:03,123
You're supposed to be a man,
not a stupid boy!

88
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:05,192
Now grow up!

89
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:07,761
<i>Act your age!</i>

90
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:15,802
Leave your names
on your paintings,

91
00:05:15,803 --> 00:05:17,804
otherwise I've no idea
whose they are.

92
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:19,439
Miss, miss...

93
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,309
- what are you doing here?
- Sorry. Is it a bad time?

94
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,611
Uh... no.

95
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,080
How've you been?

96
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:29,349
Yeah, you know,
all right.

97
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,084
Have you spoken
to Justine yet?

98
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:32,252
No.

99
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:35,956
Anyway, have you seen
the advert

100
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:37,190
for the new job?

101
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:38,458
Uh-huh.

102
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:40,460
Would you give me a hand
with the interviews?

103
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:42,462
Yeah, sure.

104
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:43,763
Great.

105
00:05:43,764 --> 00:05:46,433
I need someone to help me
outvote my father,

106
00:05:46,434 --> 00:05:49,236
<i>'cause he's bound
to want the wrong person.</i>

107
00:05:49,237 --> 00:05:50,737
I better go.

108
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:52,572
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

109
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:54,207
Why don't you
come around later?

110
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,642
We can talk
about it.

111
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:57,344
And I'll even make you some supper.

112
00:05:57,345 --> 00:05:59,413
Oh, that'd be great.
Yeah.

113
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:02,182
See you later.

114
00:06:02,183 --> 00:06:04,117
Okay, I'll see you later.

115

00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:52,299
Aaaah!

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,167
Whoo-hoo!

118
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:56,269
Whoo-
whoa, whoa, whoa!

119
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:14,687
He's right, you know.

120
00:07:14,688 --> 00:07:16,956
I'm no good
to man nor beast.

121
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:19,526
Don't be daft, lad!
You're great.

122
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:21,061
At what?

123
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:24,064
Give me a few hours
and I'll think of something.

124
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:25,965
I'm only joking.

125
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:29,036
You're good with beasts,
with machines,

126
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:30,970
and you're good
with people too.

127
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:33,673
You're just good
to have around, wee man.

128
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:36,943
Do you really
think so?

129
00:07:36,944 --> 00:07:38,345
Yeah.
I mean...

130
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:40,080
you could
really go places,

131
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:41,915
as long as you
believed in yourself.

132
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,683
How can I?
Golly doesn't.

133
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:46,319
Well, show him.
And Archie.

134
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,288
Yeah, but how?

<i>( knock on door )</i>

All right!

138
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:20,087
Sorry, have you
got a minute?

139
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:22,622
Yes, sure.
Come in.

140
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:24,357
It's...

141
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:27,026
it's about this
head ranger.

142
00:08:27,027 --> 00:08:29,362
Listen, Golly,
I want you to know

143
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:32,132
whoever we appoint won't
have anything to do with you.

144
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:33,633
<i>Okay?</i>

145
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:35,102
Right.

146
00:08:35,103 --> 00:08:37,370
I mean, you'll still
be your own boss,

147
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:39,573
<i>in charge
of the sporting side,</i>

148
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:41,475
and then the ranger
will look after hikers,

149
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:43,343
climbers, trails,
things like that.

150
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:46,179
Mm-hmm.

151
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,016
You'll both be reporting
to me separately.

152
00:08:50,017 --> 00:08:52,152
Yes, yes.

153
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:53,753
Well, unless...

154
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:55,188
unless what?

155
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,691
Unless I get
the job myself.

156
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:01,794
You'll have my application
by the end of the day.

157
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:09,469
Golly?

158
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,403
Golly.

00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:16,576
Archie.

160
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:18,612
Mother, I need
your help.

161
00:09:22,716 --> 00:09:23,750
Ah, Golly,

162
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:25,485
a moment
of your valuable time.

163
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:27,187
You've just been
with Archie?

164
00:09:27,188 --> 00:09:28,355
Uh-huh.

165
00:09:28,356 --> 00:09:30,823
Did you notice, um...

166
00:09:30,824 --> 00:09:32,792
was there any sign
of, uh...

167
00:09:32,793 --> 00:09:34,794
that'll cost you.

168
00:09:34,795 --> 00:09:35,995
What?

169
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:37,297
Oh.
Very well.

170
00:09:37,298 --> 00:09:38,865
Hector,
behave yourself.

171
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:42,202
- I'm talking favors, right?
- A gentleman's agreement?

172
00:09:42,203 --> 00:09:43,537
- Uh-huh.
- Splendid!

173
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:45,438
Whatever you say.

174
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:46,473
Well?

175
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:49,342
It's in his room.
Under the wee table.

176
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:07,460
It's locked.

Sure.

180
00:10:24,312 --> 00:10:26,779
How is she?

181
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,281
I don't know.

182
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:30,517
It's just a few things
she left behind.

183
00:10:32,052 --> 00:10:34,654
Oh, and I won't be in
for supper tonight either.

184
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:37,056
And whose table will you
be plunking your feet under?

185
00:10:37,057 --> 00:10:39,693
I've got a few things
to talk over with...

186
00:10:39,694 --> 00:10:42,596
<i>- with Katrina.
- oh, this week's model.</i>

187
00:10:42,597 --> 00:10:43,896
You don't waste much time.

188
00:10:43,897 --> 00:10:46,199
Just what point is it
you're trying to make?

189
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,135
Oh, give me a break! You're hardly
beyond one brokenhearted lassie,

190
00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:51,404
and you've got your
philandering claws into the next.

191
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:55,141
- It is a perfectly innocent business meeting.
- Come on!

192
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:58,378
If you're prepared to stomach that
one's cooking, then it must be serious.

193
00:10:58,379 --> 00:10:59,779
Lexie.

194
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,047
I hope it chokes you.

195
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,855
( whistling )

196
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:15,562
Oh, aye.

197
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:17,731
Who's away
with my ax?

198
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:54,100
Hi.

199
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:55,602
You look nice.

200
00:11:55,603 --> 00:11:58,271
So do you.

201
00:11:58,272 --> 00:12:01,107
- Come in.
- Yes. Thank you.

202
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:05,878
( growling )

203
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,448
Ah, Hector,
have you seen Golly?

204
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,785
Oh, right.

205
00:12:14,622 --> 00:12:16,656
<i>( Katrina laughing )</i>

206
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:23,863
There's still some tunabake,
if you're still hungry.

207
00:12:23,864 --> 00:12:25,064
No, no.

208
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:27,467
I'm fine, thanks.
It was...

209
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:28,735
it was very filling.

210
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:30,370
Is that your way
of saying

211
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:32,104
"no, thanks,
it was really crap"?

212
00:12:32,105 --> 00:12:34,374
Let's get
one thing straight-

213
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,676
I'm completely useless
in the kitchen.

214
00:12:36,677 --> 00:12:38,878
Pretty sensational
elsewhere in the house?

215
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,314
Archie MacDonald!
That is not

216
00:12:41,315 --> 00:12:43,115
the remark
of a gentleman!

217
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:45,017
Sorry.
Terrible thing to say.

218
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:47,086
Must be the-
the drink talking.

219
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:54,126
You know, when you smile
like that, sunny jim...

220
00:12:54,127 --> 00:12:56,463
gives you a retching feeling
in the pit of your stomach.

221
00:13:09,477 --> 00:13:11,745
- We'd better stop.
- Why?

222
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:13,946
'Cause you're pouring
chianti onto my lap.

223
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:15,248
Oh, sorry!

224
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:18,618
All right.

225
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:20,186
Sorry.

226
00:13:20,187 --> 00:13:22,221
I'll just go
and clean up,

227
00:13:22,222 --> 00:13:23,356
okay?

228
00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:24,957
Sorry.

229
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:30,363
Molly: Come on, boys, come on.

230
00:13:30,364 --> 00:13:31,931
Lovely evening,
isn't it?

231
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:34,267
Aye it is,
Molly, it is.

232
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:36,536
Would you like
a beer?

233
00:13:36,537 --> 00:13:38,237
Oh, no thanks.

234
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:39,806
It always
makes me fart.

235
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:42,509
Can't have flatulence amongst
the ruling classes, can we?

236
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,377
That would never do.

237
00:13:44,378 --> 00:13:47,046
<i>- Must be my age.
- ( dog whines )</i>

238
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:49,148
It is sad,
isn't it, Golly,

239
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:51,618
when one can't do the
things one used to?

240
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:54,921
I suppose it is.
Like?

241
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:58,658
Well, I knew that Hector and
I would be lost without Archie.

242
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:00,860
Such good judgment
for one so young.

243
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:03,296
Och, well, he's had
good training.

244
00:14:03,297 --> 00:14:06,633
Much of it from you, Golly,
we all know that.

245
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:09,803
And I know how he values
your work as head ghillie.

246
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:13,940
Let's hope he finds someone half
as good for this ranger thing.

247
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:17,844
Molly, now you've come
to mention it-

248
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:20,046
and then what a great team
he'll have, eh?

249
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:22,649
Maturity and experience
on one hand,

250
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,418
youthful drive
and energy on the other.

251
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:27,754
Aye.

252
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:30,122
And we can't be good
at everything, can we?

253
00:14:30,123 --> 00:14:31,991
No.

254
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:34,661
Oh, listen to me
rabbitting on.

255
00:14:34,662 --> 00:14:37,430
Well, I've enjoyed
our little chat.

256
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:38,832
No problem.

257
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,834
Molly...

258
00:14:42,503 --> 00:14:45,605
if Archie thinks
I'm too old for this job,

259
00:14:45,606 --> 00:14:48,641
maybe he just
better tell me himself.

260
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:18,671
Okay?

261
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:20,172
Yeah.

262
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:24,677
There's still some of that
wine left, if you want some.

263
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:27,146
No, I think maybe
I've had enough.

264
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:29,315
<i>I've got to drive home in a minute.</i>

265
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:31,551
Right.

266
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:36,990
Look, I'm sorry.

267
00:15:36,991 --> 00:15:38,791
Oh, it's no bother.
Don't worry.

268
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,259
No.

269
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,794
I meant...

270
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:43,396
oh, right.

271
00:15:43,397 --> 00:15:45,832
Well, yeah, me too.
It's just that-

272
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,299
I know.

273
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,501
Too soon.

274
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:50,469
It wouldn't be fair
on her, would it?

275
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,704
Or you.

276
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:54,607
Don't worry
about me, Archie.

277
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:56,843
I can look
after myself.

278
00:15:58,078 --> 00:15:59,345
Right.

279
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:03,917
I'd better head off then.

280
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:10,189
- Thanks for supper. It was great.
- No, it wasn't.

281
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,358
But thanks for saying so.

282
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:14,961
I'll see you
at the interviews?

283
00:16:14,962 --> 00:16:16,963
Uh-huh.

284
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:23,002
<i>Bye.</i>

285
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:41,520
<i>( door opens )</i>

286
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,598
<i>( groans )</i>

287
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:20,593
- Oh!
- Ah ha! Caught you!

288
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:23,362
You're not getting any of this
whiskey, do you understand?

289
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:25,098
Tomorrow I'm going
to call Sotheby's.

290
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,933
<i>- You can't!
- and they're gonna sell it</i>

291
00:17:26,934 --> 00:17:29,869
for loads of cash which I'm
gonna plow into the estate,

292
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,172
and you are not gonna
drink a single drop, okay?

293
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:34,974
Look, son...

294
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,342
I'm an old man.

295
00:17:36,343 --> 00:17:39,112
Very few pleasures left.

296
00:17:39,113 --> 00:17:40,780
Have a heart.

297
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:42,982
I don't have one.
So go away,

298
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:45,752
and leave me and my barrel
alone to sleep in peace.

299
00:17:48,155 --> 00:17:49,288
Rotter!

300
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,176
Whoa... argh!

301
00:18:43,177 --> 00:18:46,245
It's just a thought, you know
with all this stuff going on-

302
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:47,513
oh, no.
You did right.

303
00:18:47,514 --> 00:18:49,415
Thought we'd better
check it out.

304
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,751
You've not put a foot
wrong these past months.

305
00:18:51,752 --> 00:18:53,319
Yeah?

306
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,255
In fact, I think you're
ready for a fresh challenge.

307
00:18:56,256 --> 00:18:58,024
That's just what
Lexie was saying.

308
00:18:58,025 --> 00:19:00,860
Listen, I'm sorry if I
spoke harsh words to you.

309
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:02,661
That was completely
out of order.

310
00:19:02,662 --> 00:19:04,496
Oh, no.
No bother, Golly.

311
00:19:04,497 --> 00:19:06,498
I'm just glad you think
I'm up to this new job.

312
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:07,934
Huh?

313
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:10,269
What- hey,
come here, come here.

314
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:13,172
What do you mean,
new job?

315
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:14,440
Huh?

316
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:17,309
Well, you're-
you're not suggesting-

317
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,278
you're not suggesting
you've applied

318
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,348
for the ranger's job?
You can't do that!

319
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:24,951
- Can't I?
- That's my job.

320
00:19:24,952 --> 00:19:29,122
I'm talking about you
taking over as the ghillie!

321
00:19:29,123 --> 00:19:30,689
Oh.

322
00:19:37,898 --> 00:19:39,431
C'mon.

323
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,257
Morning.

324
00:20:04,258 --> 00:20:06,826
Or is it afternoon?

325
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:09,061
Have you got eyes
on the top of your head?

326
00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:11,831
Who needs them? Heard you
coming about 10 minutes ago.

327
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:13,632
If your eyes are
as good as your ears,

328
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:15,134
you'll know
you're trespassing.

329
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:18,037
And you must know there's
no such enforceable offense

330
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:19,806
in Scottish law.

331
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:27,847
I'm sorry.
Shall we start again?

332
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:31,450
I'm Fergal MacLure.

333
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:32,651
You must be-

334
00:20:32,652 --> 00:20:35,487
camping without permission,
disturbing the wildlife,

335
00:20:35,488 --> 00:20:37,423
as well as
posing a fire risk.

336
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:38,557
<i>Duncan: Golly!</i>

337
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:40,392
Look!
He's got a chopper!

338
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:42,028
Same make and everything.

339
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:45,198
<i>Don't tell me. Is threatening
behavior towards twigs</i>

340
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:47,333
another offense
in your statute book,

341
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:49,368
<i>Golly?</i>

342
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:53,906
( whistling )

343
00:20:53,907 --> 00:20:56,175
Hector, there's no need
to hang around.

344
00:20:56,176 --> 00:20:58,110
I can do these
by myself.

345
00:20:58,111 --> 00:20:59,979
You got them round the
wrong way last time.

346
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,380
The imperial set
hang there,

347
00:21:01,381 --> 00:21:02,715
the royal set
hang there.

348
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:04,717
And be careful, they're
my pride and joy.

349
00:21:06,854 --> 00:21:08,287
I'm watching you.

350
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:10,990
Oh, I've stopped
all that silly nonsense.

351
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:13,025
Oh, Archie, I must
talk to you about Golly.

352
00:21:13,026 --> 00:21:14,160
<i>Golly: Archie.</i>

353
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:16,362
There's someone here
for you to see.

354
00:21:16,363 --> 00:21:19,932
- Who's that?
- This guy that's been nicking all the stuff.

355
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,234
<i>Him.</i>

356
00:21:21,235 --> 00:21:22,735
Fergal!
How're you doing?

357
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:25,171
How's it going, Archie?
Listen, sorry about this.

358
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,406
Wait a minute.
You two know one another?

359
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:30,409
Yeah. Fergal's applied
for the job.

360
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,512
He asked if he could spend
a couple of days on the estate,

361
00:21:33,513 --> 00:21:35,481
look around, get to know
the place better.

362
00:21:35,482 --> 00:21:36,883
I see.

363
00:21:38,986 --> 00:21:41,787
Yeah, Fergal,
I'll catch up with you later.

364
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:44,123
Yeah, sure.
No problem.

365
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,827
<i>I know, I'm sorry, I
should have said something.</i>

366
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:51,697
It's just that- you know-
with all that's going on-

367
00:21:51,698 --> 00:21:52,865
better late than never.

368
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:55,501
Right.

369
00:21:55,502 --> 00:21:58,037
Well, if you'll
excuse me, I've...

370
00:21:58,038 --> 00:21:59,538
an important phone call
to make.

371
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:02,308
Archie!

372
00:22:07,114 --> 00:22:08,514
Oh!

373
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:10,616
It's about tomorrow's
interview.

374
00:22:10,617 --> 00:22:11,683
Yeah?

375
00:22:11,684 --> 00:22:13,552
Well, I just wanted
to make it clear

376
00:22:13,553 --> 00:22:17,323
that... I'm definitely going
ahead with my application.

377
00:22:17,324 --> 00:22:18,590
You are?

378
00:22:18,591 --> 00:22:21,527
Archie, it's too good
an opportunity to miss.

379
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,497
Uh, Golly...

380
00:22:25,498 --> 00:22:28,367
Golly, have you-
have you thought about this?

381
00:22:28,368 --> 00:22:31,503
<i>I've thought about it
very carefully, Archie.</i>

382
00:22:31,504 --> 00:22:32,905
<i>And you're happy
to go up</i>

383
00:22:32,906 --> 00:22:35,541
<i>against the likes
of Fergal and Duncan?</i>

384
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:37,676
I know that there are
some who think I'm just...

385
00:22:37,677 --> 00:22:39,412
a wee bit too long
in the tooth for it.

386
00:22:39,413 --> 00:22:40,413
No.

387
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:42,248
I'm sure
a sensible chap like you

388
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:43,983
appreciates
the value of experience.

389
00:22:43,984 --> 00:22:44,984
Absolutely, yeah.

390
00:22:44,985 --> 00:22:46,152
As well as the provisions

391
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:49,855
of the equal opportunities act
of 1992.

392
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,723
I'll see you
in the morning.

Where are you?


396
00:23:10,444 --> 00:23:13,112
I think you need
your head examined.

397
00:23:13,113 --> 00:23:14,981
If you know
what I mean.

398
00:23:14,982 --> 00:23:16,082

399
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:19,718
Hector.

400

Hector?

401
00:23:21,388 --> 00:23:23,155
Kilwillie's on the phone.

402
00:23:23,156 --> 00:23:26,092
Wants to know if the fox
has left his den yet,

403
00:23:26,093 --> 00:23:28,094
whatever that means.

404
00:23:29,296 --> 00:23:31,297
Hector?

407

In a sealed cask.

408
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:41,140
Well, I was wondering

409
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:43,942
if you might be able
to auction it for me.

410
00:23:43,943 --> 00:23:45,911
Good.

411
00:23:45,912 --> 00:23:47,546
How much?

412
00:23:47,547 --> 00:23:49,215
Really?

413
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:51,083
That's amazing!

414
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:53,352
Hang on, I'll just
check the thing.

415
00:23:59,893 --> 00:24:01,227

<i>Archie:
Where is it?</i>

421
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:43,169
- What?
- The barrel.

422
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,803
- What barrel?
- You know what barrel.

423
00:24:44,804 --> 00:24:46,505
I don't know what
you're talking about.

424
00:24:46,506 --> 00:24:47,706
- You took it.
- I didn't.

425
00:24:47,707 --> 00:24:49,075
There's no point
denying it.

426
00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:50,642
I did not!
All right,

427
00:24:50,643 --> 00:24:51,643
if I've got it,

428
00:24:51,644 --> 00:24:52,878
where is it now then?

429
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:09,728
Ah ha!

430
00:25:09,729 --> 00:25:11,663
Another conspirator, eh?

431
00:25:12,966 --> 00:25:15,734
So, you agreed to be
the getaway in the heist,

432
00:25:15,735 --> 00:25:18,237
in return for my father's
vote at tomorrow's interviews.

433
00:25:18,238 --> 00:25:19,705
Eh?

434
00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:22,174
I'm surprised
at you, Duncan.

435
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:24,443
Surprised
and disappointed.

436
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,380
No, no, listen, boss,
I can explain!

What is it, Badger?

440
00:26:05,852 --> 00:26:06,852
Oh.

<i>Hector: Kilwillie?</i>

- Kilwillie!
- Yes!

444
00:26:10,657 --> 00:26:13,425
Ah. The fox has
gone to earth,

445
00:26:13,426 --> 00:26:16,262
<i>having dug himself
a rather deeper den.</i>

446
00:26:16,263 --> 00:26:17,663
Plan B, I think.

447
00:26:17,664 --> 00:26:18,864
I understand.

448
00:26:18,865 --> 00:26:20,832
Into the starting gate
first thing tomorrow.

Thank you, Badger.

Hi.

453
00:27:21,228 --> 00:27:23,195
Sorry, I hope
I didn't startle you.

454
00:27:23,196 --> 00:27:24,963
Having a nice paddle?

455
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:28,166
Well, you're not
gonna believe this, but...

456
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:30,936
I'm actually looking
for freshwater crayfish.

457
00:27:30,937 --> 00:27:32,271
That's a new one.

458
00:27:32,272 --> 00:27:33,739
You should try
further down.

<i>I had my school kids
looking for them last week.</i>

460

There's a dipper there, too.

461
00:27:37,644 --> 00:27:38,877
A bird?

462
00:27:38,878 --> 00:27:40,479
Lovely wee thing.

463
00:27:41,615 --> 00:27:43,882
Yeah, but better insulated
than homo sapiens.

464
00:27:45,252 --> 00:27:48,086
I'm freezing.
Do you mind?

465
00:27:48,087 --> 00:27:49,788
I'm sorry?

466
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:51,223
Well...

467
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:53,925
it's just that...

468
00:27:53,926 --> 00:27:54,960
I'm not...

469
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:56,795
oh! Sorry.

470
00:27:58,431 --> 00:28:00,031

<i>I mean...</i>

472

Ah, please.

Kilwillie,

00:28:43,176 --> 00:28:45,010
excuse us a second.

00:28:48,915 --> 00:28:51,684
It's time, Hector.

484
00:28:51,685 --> 00:28:53,652
Time?
Time for what?

485
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:54,886
What do you know?

486
00:28:54,887 --> 00:28:58,089
Time for you to repay
that wee favor you owe me.

487
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,425
What?

488
00:28:59,426 --> 00:29:01,460
Ah. Yes.

489
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:03,128
I think you know
what to do,

490
00:29:03,129 --> 00:29:05,631
which way
your conscience lies.

491
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:06,932

Mind your own business!
Now, where were we?

00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:17,876
Mission impossible.

Do you mind?

00:29:32,225 --> 00:29:33,759
Now,
when you go in,

503
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,794
shake them
by the hand.

504
00:29:35,795 --> 00:29:37,663
Wish them
a good day.

505
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,898
Establish
some authority.

506
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:43,001
And when you talk,

507
00:29:43,002 --> 00:29:44,870
don't look
at your shoes,

508
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:46,204
but at them.

509
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:49,107
Maintain eye contact
at all times.

510
00:29:51,944 --> 00:29:53,278
There.

511
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,414
What do we think
about that then?

512
00:29:57,149 --> 00:30:00,952
Oh, Duncan, you look like
a porn star from the 1970's.

513
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:08,660
I think we might need your help, Molly.

514
00:30:23,376 --> 00:30:24,943
When you've got it,

515
00:30:24,944 --> 00:30:27,112
don't let it
out of your sight.

Well?

533
00:31:01,648 --> 00:31:03,882
Definitely not. Eyes too
close together, I think.

534

Testing,
testing!

00:31:09,656 --> 00:31:11,056
Give that to me!

539
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:12,724
Mother.

540
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:14,927
You had no right
to take that- uh...

541
00:31:14,928 --> 00:31:16,227
Molly, if Kilwillie

542
00:31:16,228 --> 00:31:17,496
should happen
to make contact-

543
00:31:17,497 --> 00:31:19,030
father, please.

544
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:20,999
All right.

545
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,568
Thank you.

546
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:24,536
( radio static )

547
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,452
<i>( rattling )</i>

548
00:31:47,426 --> 00:31:49,761
<i>Archie: Sorry to have kept you waiting.</i>

549
00:31:49,762 --> 00:31:51,196
We're running
a little behind.

550
00:31:51,197 --> 00:31:52,598
If you'd like
to come through.

551
00:31:57,704 --> 00:31:59,037
<i>Hmm...</i>

552
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:00,606
another woman
in the house.

553
00:32:00,607 --> 00:32:03,208
I'm not that stupid,
Molly.

554
00:32:03,209 --> 00:32:04,877
<i>Molly:
Oh, Hector,</i>

555
00:32:04,878 --> 00:32:07,078
Peter O'Sullivan
asked me to tell you

556
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:09,414
<i>that red rum
has crossed</i>

557
00:32:09,415 --> 00:32:11,917
the milling road.

558
00:32:48,955 --> 00:32:49,988
Molly,

559
00:32:49,989 --> 00:32:52,157
I've just jumped beaches.

560
00:32:52,158 --> 00:32:53,258
First time round.

561
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:54,760
Over and out.

562
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:56,662
Very good.
Over.

563
00:32:56,663 --> 00:32:58,730
Duncan.

564
00:32:58,731 --> 00:32:59,765
We're ready.

565
00:33:03,002 --> 00:33:04,603
- Aww.
- Aww.

566
00:33:04,604 --> 00:33:06,638
Duncan,
you're a vision

567
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:08,506
in tweed.

568
00:33:08,507 --> 00:33:10,475
Good luck, son.

569
00:33:10,476 --> 00:33:12,077
Remember,
walk tall,

570
00:33:12,078 --> 00:33:13,812
and may
the best man win.

571
00:33:13,813 --> 00:33:16,181
Thanks very much,
Golly.

572
00:33:16,182 --> 00:33:18,249
I appreciate that.

573
00:33:20,887 --> 00:33:22,454
Knock 'em dead,
sweetheart.

574
00:33:22,455 --> 00:33:24,422
And remember,
whatever happens,

575
00:33:24,423 --> 00:33:25,924
I'm proud of you.

576
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:36,468
Molly, any news?

577
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,475
( grunting )

578
00:33:53,086 --> 00:33:54,352
( sighs )

579
00:34:09,035 --> 00:34:11,469
Duncan, that tie...

580
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:14,472
I didn't know you were a member
of the old naval military.

581
00:34:14,473 --> 00:34:16,942
Archie: It's one of yours, father.

582
00:34:18,011 --> 00:34:19,077
Oh.

583
00:34:20,747 --> 00:34:22,247
<i>Archie:
Right, Duncan.</i>

584
00:34:22,248 --> 00:34:24,016
Perhaps you can tell us why you think

585
00:34:24,017 --> 00:34:25,951
you're the right candidate for this job.

586
00:34:29,789 --> 00:34:32,791
I've learned a lot...

587
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:37,095
and now I'm ready to take on
more responsibilities.

588
00:34:45,805 --> 00:34:48,439
Oh, for god's sake,
life's too short.

589
00:34:54,914 --> 00:34:58,750
How do we preserve
the balance

590
00:34:58,751 --> 00:35:01,753
between providing
access to all...

591
00:35:02,955 --> 00:35:06,624
preserving the environment...

592
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,760
and making the estate
pay its way?

593
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:10,862
That's the question.

594
00:35:10,863 --> 00:35:13,932
Or questions.

595
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:21,073
( sigh of relief )

596
00:36:06,786 --> 00:36:08,820
Where is the stupid thing!

597
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,062
This is a beautiful place,
but it's time...

598
00:36:17,063 --> 00:36:20,365
that the ordinary folk
got to enjoy it.

599
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:23,368
Excellent, Duncan,

600
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:24,903
<i>excellent.</i>

601
00:36:24,904 --> 00:36:27,139
Right.
Thanks very much.

602
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,673
Ta.

603
00:36:32,245 --> 00:36:33,745
Well.

604
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,754
- Well?
- How did it go?

605
00:36:42,755 --> 00:36:45,623
It was just...
great!

606
00:36:45,624 --> 00:36:47,259
Both:
Aww...

607
00:36:56,602 --> 00:36:58,904
the history of my family

608
00:36:58,905 --> 00:37:00,672
is intertwined
with your family.

609
00:37:00,673 --> 00:37:03,041
There have been
MacKenzies here

610
00:37:03,042 --> 00:37:05,811
as long as there
have been MacDonalds,

611
00:37:05,812 --> 00:37:10,115
and the service
which I am proud to provide

612
00:37:10,116 --> 00:37:12,083
was given by my father
before him,

613
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:14,619
and his father before him

614
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,754
<i>and so on
for five generations.</i>

615
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:19,257
Of course, I understand

616
00:37:19,258 --> 00:37:21,626
that the times,
they are a-changing.

617
00:37:21,627 --> 00:37:24,029
<i>You might look at me
and think,</i>

618
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,297
good old Golly...

619
00:37:26,398 --> 00:37:28,466
nice chap,
good at his job, but...

620
00:37:29,735 --> 00:37:32,838
you can't teach
an old dog new tricks.

621
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:34,706
<i>Well, you'd be wrong.</i>

622
00:37:34,707 --> 00:37:37,408
<i>I might not have
some fancy degrees</i>

623
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:39,544
from some fancy university,
but...

624
00:37:40,913 --> 00:37:43,048
I do have something
other folk don't.

625
00:37:44,317 --> 00:37:45,616
Passion.

626
00:37:45,617 --> 00:37:47,552
<i>( barrel banging )</i>

627
00:37:54,927 --> 00:37:56,294
( sizzling )

628
00:37:59,598 --> 00:38:00,631
( barking )

629
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:38,270
Fergal, this is
Katrina Finlay.

630
00:38:38,271 --> 00:38:40,872
- Hello. Again.
- Hi.

631
00:38:40,873 --> 00:38:43,275
You've already met?

632
00:38:43,276 --> 00:38:45,643
Well...
you could say that.

633
00:38:47,313 --> 00:38:49,814
<i>Fergal: Just a few days here tells you</i>

634
00:38:49,815 --> 00:38:52,317
<i>the glen has a quite
staggering biodiversity.</i>

635
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:54,685
<i>I think what we
have to achieve is a means</i>

636
00:38:54,686 --> 00:38:56,388
of protecting
and promoting it,

637
00:38:56,389 --> 00:38:59,357
while also increasing
visitors and income.

638
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:00,992
But how would you do that?

639
00:39:00,993 --> 00:39:02,827
It's quite straightforward,
really.

640
00:39:02,828 --> 00:39:04,729
You just encourage
the people to go

641
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,031
where the diversity isn't,

642
00:39:06,032 --> 00:39:08,633
by means of tracks and signs
throughout the estate.

643
00:39:08,634 --> 00:39:11,736
Actually, I've just finished a
project to achieve the same objectives.

644
00:39:11,737 --> 00:39:12,938
Where was that?

645
00:39:14,006 --> 00:39:15,273
Botswana.

646
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:18,643
I've always wanted
to go there.

647
00:39:18,644 --> 00:39:20,111
Okavango Delta.

648
00:39:20,112 --> 00:39:22,213
<i>Oh, I loved it, you know.</i>

649
00:39:22,214 --> 00:39:25,183
<i>I mean, not just the place,
but the people too.</i>

650
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:28,119
- It's brilliant.
- I can imagine.

651
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,887
<i>Mm.
Yeah.</i>

652
00:39:29,888 --> 00:39:31,689
Sorry.

653
00:39:34,427 --> 00:39:36,294
( panting )

654
00:39:41,334 --> 00:39:43,734
<i>Archie: Fergal, you've
fantastic qualifications.</i>

655
00:39:43,735 --> 00:39:45,971
You've traveled and worked
all over the world.

656
00:39:45,972 --> 00:39:48,239
Why would you want
to come to Glenbogle?

657
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,741
I don't know.

658
00:39:50,742 --> 00:39:52,710
Maybe it's time
to settle down,

659
00:39:52,711 --> 00:39:54,312
put down some roots.

660
00:39:56,715 --> 00:39:57,949
Great.

661
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,817
If you wouldn't mind
waiting outside?

662
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:01,686
- Sure.
- I smell a rat.

663
00:40:01,687 --> 00:40:04,622
I don't believe all this
flannel. You're hiding something.

664
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:08,226
<i>- Father, please!
- no, it's all right, Archie.</i>

665
00:40:08,227 --> 00:40:10,561
Um...

666
00:40:10,562 --> 00:40:13,465
when I was in Africa,
my brother got ill,

667
00:40:13,466 --> 00:40:16,434
and I had to come back
to help him.

668
00:40:16,435 --> 00:40:18,136
They took one
of my kidneys out,

669
00:40:18,137 --> 00:40:20,071
and stuck it in him.

670
00:40:20,072 --> 00:40:21,873
Wow...

671
00:40:21,874 --> 00:40:24,242
<i>anyway, it's all
worked out okay,</i>

672
00:40:24,243 --> 00:40:27,345
but the doctors have asked me
to hang around for a while,

673
00:40:27,346 --> 00:40:29,347
so...
( clears throat )

674
00:40:29,348 --> 00:40:30,281
I need a job.

675
00:40:31,817 --> 00:40:34,519
<i>Molly: I'm so sorry to disturb you,</i>

676
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,621
but the person concerned
was insistent.

677
00:40:36,622 --> 00:40:38,556
Hector, I've been asked
to tell you

678
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:40,791
that the horse
has unseated its jockey

679
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:42,860
<i>at the canal turn.</i>

680
00:40:47,633 --> 00:40:49,567
I'm so sorry.

681
00:40:51,203 --> 00:40:52,937
Where is it?

682
00:40:52,938 --> 00:40:55,507
I don't know. I don't think
that whiskey wants to be drunk!

683
00:40:55,508 --> 00:40:57,008
I told you-

684
00:40:57,009 --> 00:40:59,644
if you ask me, the bally thing
has got a mind of its own!

685
00:40:59,645 --> 00:41:01,346
Oh, don't be so ridiculous!

686
00:41:06,152 --> 00:41:08,520
Yes!

687
00:41:20,466 --> 00:41:22,300
Oh, thanks, Lex.

688
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:23,568
So...

689
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:26,137
ready for the big
decision, eh?

690
00:41:26,138 --> 00:41:27,605
Let me guess.

691
00:41:27,606 --> 00:41:29,607
Hector'll go for Golly...

692
00:41:31,477 --> 00:41:33,844
she'll go for Fergal...

693
00:41:34,913 --> 00:41:36,881
so you'll hold
the casting vote.

694
00:41:38,284 --> 00:41:40,485
You need the tope, Arch.

695
00:41:59,738 --> 00:42:03,541
<i>Molly on radio:
Kilwillie...</i>

696
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:06,177
<i># Kilwillie... #</i>

697
00:42:11,883 --> 00:42:14,319
yes, Molly?
Over.

698
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,787
<i>Are you looking
for these?</i>

699
00:42:22,928 --> 00:42:26,030
Oh.
Molly,

700
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:28,399
give them back, please!

701
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,668
Come on now.
Be a good girl.

702
00:42:30,669 --> 00:42:33,538
Molly, as you know,
I am not a man of violence,

703
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:35,640
but I must have
those keys!

704
00:42:37,176 --> 00:42:38,343
Molly!

705
00:42:43,148 --> 00:42:45,750
First rule of management:
Promote from within.

706
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:48,052
Disastrous for morale
to do otherwise.

707
00:42:48,053 --> 00:42:49,987
Yes, but who?
Golly or Duncan?

708
00:42:49,988 --> 00:42:51,156
Golly, of course!

709
00:42:51,157 --> 00:42:53,791
<i>I must confess
Duncan surprised me.</i>

710
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:56,461
I often cursed the boy, but
he seems to have hidden depths.

711
00:42:56,462 --> 00:42:58,496
But let's face it,
he's far too young.

712
00:42:58,497 --> 00:43:00,465
<i>Katrina: Yeah, Duncan impressed me too,</i>

713
00:43:00,466 --> 00:43:02,267
but he doesn't hold a candle to Fergal

714
00:43:02,268 --> 00:43:04,302
in terms of experience and expertise.

715
00:43:04,303 --> 00:43:05,503
And what about Golly?

716
00:43:05,504 --> 00:43:07,438
Golly is
a fantastic asset,

717
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:09,840
but is he right
for this job?

718
00:43:09,841 --> 00:43:12,577
Surely it's better to have
them all working for you.

719
00:43:12,578 --> 00:43:15,446
After all, Fergal has
perfect qualifications.

720
00:43:15,447 --> 00:43:18,283
I think we should grab
him with both hands.

721
00:43:18,284 --> 00:43:20,151
Most apt.

722
00:43:20,152 --> 00:43:21,419
What?

723
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,388
Well, you're sure
you're not backing him

724
00:43:23,389 --> 00:43:27,258
<i>because of his...
other qualifications?</i>

725
00:43:27,259 --> 00:43:30,127
<i>Hector: Right. I go for
Golly, she goes for Fergal.</i>

726
00:43:30,128 --> 00:43:32,163
It's up to you, Archie.

727
00:43:32,164 --> 00:43:33,964
What are you
gonna do?

728
00:43:33,965 --> 00:43:36,601
<i>( clock ticking )</i>

729
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:41,806
Fergal, would you
join us again, please?

730
00:43:41,807 --> 00:43:44,375
<i>Golly, Duncan,
I'd like to talk to you</i>

731
00:43:44,376 --> 00:43:47,245
<i>in a couple of minutes,
if that's okay.</i>

732
00:43:48,414 --> 00:43:50,682
Laddie...
wait.

733
00:44:13,372 --> 00:44:16,140
Duncan...
look, I'm sorry.

734
00:44:16,141 --> 00:44:17,475
Stupid!

735
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:19,210
That's our Duncan.

736
00:44:19,211 --> 00:44:21,379
As if you'd ever give
that kind of job to me.

737
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,980
- Listen-
- stupid!

738
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,752
But it doesn't mean
I don't have dreams, you know.

739
00:44:27,753 --> 00:44:29,520
Things I want to do
with my life.

740
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,792
Duncan, how would you like
to be Fergal's deputy?

741
00:44:38,697 --> 00:44:41,065
<i>Archie: Look, I'm
sorry. I really thought</i>

742
00:44:41,066 --> 00:44:42,933
Fergal was the best man
for the job.

743
00:44:42,934 --> 00:44:44,435
Obviously.

744
00:44:44,436 --> 00:44:46,704
Not content with that,
you gave him Duncan.

745
00:44:47,773 --> 00:44:49,741
Golly, I want
to say to you

746
00:44:49,742 --> 00:44:52,443
that there is no one around
here more valuable to me

747
00:44:52,444 --> 00:44:53,444
than you-

748
00:44:53,445 --> 00:44:55,780
professionally
and personally.

749
00:44:55,781 --> 00:44:57,982
Actions speak louder
than words, sir.

750
00:45:00,018 --> 00:45:03,554
Archie, I'm just gonna show
Katrina the otter hole I found.

751
00:45:03,555 --> 00:45:04,555
All right.
Good.

752
00:45:04,556 --> 00:45:05,556
See you later, Arch.

753
00:45:05,557 --> 00:45:07,124
See ya.

754
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:09,126
You know... thanks again.

755
00:45:09,127 --> 00:45:11,095
I think I'm really
gonna love it here.

756
00:45:11,096 --> 00:45:13,765
I'm sure you will.
You'll do a great job.

757
00:45:15,768 --> 00:45:18,903
Fergal:
Katrina... wait up.

758
00:45:18,904 --> 00:45:21,105
So, have you ever seen
an otter before?

759
00:45:21,106 --> 00:45:22,039
Oh, yes.

760
00:45:30,783 --> 00:45:33,418
Well?

761
00:45:33,419 --> 00:45:36,621
Some might say you're the
biggest fool in Scotland.

762
00:45:37,956 --> 00:45:40,191
Not me.

763
00:45:40,192 --> 00:45:42,259
What you did today
took guts.

764
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,696
Integrity.

765
00:45:44,697 --> 00:45:47,365
You've gone a long way
up in my estimation.

766
00:45:48,834 --> 00:45:51,202
If that's
any comfort.

767
00:45:51,203 --> 00:45:52,770
Thanks, Lex.

768
00:46:00,879 --> 00:46:02,112
Come on.

769
00:46:05,217 --> 00:46:07,284
( sighs )

770
00:46:13,892 --> 00:46:15,893
What are you doing?

771
00:46:15,894 --> 00:46:18,830
We are just taking your
whiskey for a walk, Archie.

772
00:46:18,831 --> 00:46:19,930
Aren't we, Kilwillie?

773
00:46:19,931 --> 00:46:21,298
Kilwillie!

774
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:24,068
I'm sorry, old man. She
cut me off at the pass.

775
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:26,136
Molly, you had no right!

776
00:46:26,137 --> 00:46:28,439
Kilwillie and I have made
a little deal, haven't we?

777
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,275
A deal? Kilwillie,
I was once told

778
00:46:31,276 --> 00:46:33,578
that when you were
a tubby little tyke at Eton,

779
00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:35,279
<i>you used to cheat
at conkers.</i>

780
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,281
I didn't believe it,
until now!

781
00:46:37,282 --> 00:46:39,851
The last Lagganmore Peculiar
to come up for auction

782
00:46:39,852 --> 00:46:41,686
went for �600 a bottle!

783
00:46:41,687 --> 00:46:43,554
This cask
will fill 20 bottles,

784
00:46:43,555 --> 00:46:46,491
and I will give you
15 grand,

785
00:46:46,492 --> 00:46:48,125
plus one bottle back.

786
00:46:48,126 --> 00:46:49,694
What, for father?

787
00:46:49,695 --> 00:46:51,195
No.

788
00:46:51,196 --> 00:46:52,864
For your firstborn, Archie.

789
00:46:53,932 --> 00:46:55,700
My little stipulation.

790
00:47:00,038 --> 00:47:02,473
Kilwillie: Archie,
I've brought the check.

791
00:47:02,474 --> 00:47:04,108
Excellent.

792
00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:07,244
This should just cover Fergal's
salary for the first year.

793
00:47:07,245 --> 00:47:08,479
Hector:
How marvelous.

794
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:12,617
Thank you.

795
00:47:12,618 --> 00:47:14,786
Ha ha ha!

796
00:47:14,787 --> 00:47:16,654
Oh, what a day!
I need a drink.

797
00:47:16,655 --> 00:47:18,523
<i>Molly:
It's almost teatime.</i>

798
00:47:18,524 --> 00:47:20,324
No, no, mother,
a proper drink.

799
00:47:20,325 --> 00:47:22,393
<i>A legendary drink.</i>

800
00:47:22,394 --> 00:47:24,429
A drink to ward off
evil spirits

801
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:25,930
and ungenerous
thoughts and...

802
00:47:25,931 --> 00:47:27,298
general unhappiness.

803
00:47:27,299 --> 00:47:29,166
Ooh...
what a very good idea!

804
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:30,868
Archie...
you don't mean...

805
00:47:31,937 --> 00:47:33,471
what do you say,
Kilwillie?

806
00:47:35,474 --> 00:47:36,741
Oh, why not?

807
00:47:36,742 --> 00:47:37,975
<i>Come on.</i>

808
00:47:37,976 --> 00:47:39,977
Let's all get
as squiffy

809
00:47:39,978 --> 00:47:41,579
as 40 Billy goats!

810
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,214
A frabjous day at last!

811
00:47:46,718 --> 00:47:49,454
Kilwillie: Well... magical moment.

812
00:47:49,455 --> 00:47:51,221
To your firstborn,
Archie.

813
00:47:51,222 --> 00:47:52,557
And don't hang about.

814
00:47:52,558 --> 00:47:54,859
The way things are going,
I wouldn't hold your breath.

815
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,860
Slainte.

816
00:47:55,861 --> 00:47:56,794
All:
Slainte.

817
00:48:04,002 --> 00:48:05,102
Mmm.

818
00:48:07,706 --> 00:48:09,841
( all coughing )

819
00:48:11,343 --> 00:48:13,344
It's gone off.

820
00:48:14,613 --> 00:48:17,414
Tough luck, old man.
It's gone off!

821
00:48:17,415 --> 00:48:19,216
Ha ha ha!

822
00:48:40,005 --> 00:48:42,974
