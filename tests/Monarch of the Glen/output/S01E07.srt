<i>( birds chirping )</i>

2
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,068
Match day temperament-

3
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:28,270
I've never had it.

4
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:30,405
I'm not sure
I'm ready, Golly.

5
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:32,775
I was the same my first time in charge.

6
00:00:32,776 --> 00:00:35,343
But you
listen up, son.

7
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:37,846
Walk tall,
walk straight,

8
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:39,915
And look the world
right in the eye.

9
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,017
Right, that's good.

10
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:43,986
Who said that?

11
00:00:43,987 --> 00:00:46,288
One of the giants
of celtic culture.

12
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,891
What's his name-
Robert the Bruce?

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,994
Robbie Burns?

14
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:54,262
Val Doonican.

15
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:58,067
<i>Katrina: First of all, I would
like to thank the returning officer</i>

16
00:00:58,068 --> 00:01:01,804
<i>And all those who have made
this election and count</i>

17
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:04,006
<i>Such a smooth
and efficient one.</i>

18
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:07,076
My victory today
marks a defining moment

19
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:09,177
In Scottish politics.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,782
Who's Val Doonican?

21
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:16,151

( telephone ringing )

23
00:01:59,562 --> 00:02:02,965
Hello. Morning.
I'm just on my way.

24
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:05,367
What?

25
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:07,469
Oh no.

26
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,705
No, if you're sick,
you're sick.

27
00:02:09,706 --> 00:02:12,240
Don't worry,
I'll think of something.

28
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:14,543
You take care
of yourself.

29
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:16,244
Bye.

30
00:02:20,884 --> 00:02:23,185
Lexie: I don't quite get
the point in this, Arch.

31
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:25,520
You're supposed to be the expert
in the menu department.

32
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,823
First course,
fresh Scottish salmon.

33
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:29,992
Second course,
fresh Scottish grouse.

34
00:02:29,993 --> 00:02:33,495
You've been looking forward
to seeing your posh tottie.

35
00:02:34,998 --> 00:02:36,498
Oh! There's one!

36
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:38,633
Lexie, be quiet
or I'll send you home.

37
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:40,435
Sorry, dad.

38
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:43,371
I won't take you racing
out to London either.

39
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,575
Whoa!

40
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:25,881
Ah! I love the smell
of cordite in the morning.

41
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,651
You know, I can remember
my first Glorious 12th

42
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:31,120
Like it was yesterday.

43
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:34,990
August, 1938.
Old house was packed.

44
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:37,092
Bishops,
bandleaders,

45
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:39,094
King of Bulgaria,
prime minister too.

46
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:42,030
Old Neville Chamberlain came here
on his way to suck up to Hitler.

47
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:43,899
Hector, we need
to get going.

48
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,534
The lad's got to leave
with the birds in an hour.

49
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:48,237
Shall I start
the beaters off?

50
00:03:48,238 --> 00:03:51,140
No, no, no, Duncan.
I'll do that.

51
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:55,144
Here...

52
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,747
You take these.

53
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:17,699
Morning.
First customer, eh?

54
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,134
Sorry?

55
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:21,069
You've come to vote.

56
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,505
No need to ask who for.

57
00:04:23,506 --> 00:04:25,640
Might as well.

58
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:31,814
- A race you say?
- Yes.

59
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:34,349
With dead grouse
as the competitors?

60
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,786
Could you possibly direct me
towards the point of this exercise?

61
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:39,554
It's organized
by a food magazine-

62
00:04:39,555 --> 00:04:41,690
The first restaurant to
serve grouse to a customer

63
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:43,425
On the first day
of the shooting season

64
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:45,560
Wins ï¿½5,000 and a feature
in the next edition.

65
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:47,796
What an extraordinarily
stupid idea.

66
00:04:47,797 --> 00:04:49,898
<i>What do you mean-
food magazine?</i>

67
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:52,267
It would be great publicity
for the restaurant.

68
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:54,970
The business I'm supposed to
be running with my girlfriend?

69
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:57,539
Meanwhile, smooth running
of the household is disrupted.

70
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,408
I can't wait to get cracking in
a proper kitchen for a change.

71
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:02,277
The last time Lexie
went AWOL-

72
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:05,747
When my Aunt Maggie had
the temerity to expire suddenly?

73
00:05:05,748 --> 00:05:07,515
Golly prepared dinner.

74
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,484
He presented me
with an omelette

75
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:12,687
That looked and tasted
like a polystyrene tile.

76
00:05:35,578 --> 00:05:38,280
Breakfast.
Eat.

77
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:40,782
- You're a poppet.
- I try to please.

78
00:05:40,783 --> 00:05:42,484
And you do.

79
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,454
You worried?

80
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:50,025
<i>- I just hope everything goes okay
with Archie in the- - of course it will.</i>

81
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:52,394
Two cooks in the kitchen-
it'll be a breeze.

82
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,032
I didn't quite mean that.

83
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:59,034
Listen, Lennie,
these last couple of months,

84
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:02,170
I'd never
have got by without you.

85
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:04,940
I mean it.
I'm very grateful.

86
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:12,214
No worries...
But thanks.

87
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,389
Delicious.

88
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,064
Archie, I was just
going to call you.

89
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:31,533
- Listen- - mustn't
canvass voters on their way

90
00:06:31,534 --> 00:06:33,501
To exercise their
democratic prerogative-

91
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:35,603
Even if it is just
a council election.

92
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,245
Archie MacDonald.

93
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,084
Thanks.

94
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:03,265
Archie, I need your help.
Maureen's let me down.

95
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:05,200
She was gonna help me
organize the day.

96
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:07,702
- "Get the vote out" and that.
- I can't. Sorry.

97
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:09,537
You can't?
Or you won't?

98
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:11,974
Katrina, I won't be
here. I'm going to London.

99
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:15,543
Oh- you going
to see Justine?

100
00:07:15,544 --> 00:07:18,981
I will be seeing Justine.

101
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:22,317
Well, have a terrific time.

102
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:24,152
Thanks.

103
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:27,189
I'll just have to find
somebody else then, won't I?

104
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,324
Look, I've said
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:31,926
Could you tell me how
you voted, please?

106
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:34,029
Why would I
tell you that?

107
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,198
It's standard procedure
in elections.

108
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,800
It helps the parties keep
check on how they're doing.

109
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:41,970
No, I'm not gonna tell you how
I voted. That's my business.

110
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:44,039
You didn't vote for me,
did you!?

111
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,274
( helicopter whirring )

112
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:48,676
( silent )

113
00:07:54,617 --> 00:07:56,584
- Good luck, my boy.
- And you.

114
00:07:56,585 --> 00:07:58,620
- Smash the opposition, okay.
- Yes!

115
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,292
( horn honks )

116
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:20,475
Arch, isn't this fab?

117
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:22,544
Yeah, great.

118
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:26,415
( silent )

119
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,317
Ah, may the best man win.

120
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,636
<i>Hector: I wish you all happy hunting</i>

121
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:52,307
And leave you in the very
capable hands of Duncan here.

122
00:08:54,477 --> 00:08:56,611
Thanks Hect-

123
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:59,013
Mr. MacDonald.

124
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,619
Gentlemen,
I earnestly hope...

125
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,723
That you have very good
sport here today.

126
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:12,527
There's loads of birds
out there.

127
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:16,231
"The hills are alive,"
you might say.

128
00:09:16,232 --> 00:09:18,133
( dog whimpers )

129
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:22,104
Anyway, if you're ready...

130
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:25,407
We'll mosey on out.

131
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:29,244
Well done, Duncan.
That was jolly good.

132
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:31,613
Now give them hell.

133
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:34,282
I earnestly hope.

134
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,855
Kilwillie, I thought you
had some fool election today.

135
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:44,292
Democracy's important,
but not that important.

136
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,295
<i>Anyway, the political
machine's well-oiled.</i>

137
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,297
What with?
Your filthy lucre?

138
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,500
Nothing so gross!

139
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:54,402
A few cases
of Kilwillie old malt.

140
00:09:54,403 --> 00:09:56,871
Kilwillie.
That's corruption.

141
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:59,474
No, my dear.
That's politics.

142
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:01,943
So, shall we
to the butts?

143
00:10:01,944 --> 00:10:04,246
<i>( helicopter whirring )</i>

144
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:15,089
Look, everything's dead wee.

145
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:25,267
- Confident then?
- Publicly, I'm unbeatable.

146
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:28,036
Privately,
I'm gonna get smashed.

147
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:30,572
Morning,
Mrs. McCann.

148
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:32,907
There's one vote
I didn't get.

149
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:35,510
- If I get beaten here-
- you won't.

150
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,479
You've done your canvassing,
haven't you?

151
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,649
Then it's all about getting the vote
out on the day. Show me your returns.

152
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,418
- Don't you have to get on your way?
- No. Why?

153
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:46,655
I thought you said you were
on important party business.

154
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:50,024
So I am. But I prefer to
think it's mostly private.

155
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,260
You mean you came
all this way to...

156
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:54,396
Yes, to help you.

157
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:57,499
Oh, Alan, thank you.

158
00:10:59,468 --> 00:11:02,637
I like to think of myself
as your political mentor,

159
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:04,906
And of you in a-

160
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:07,642
Well, rather more
intimate role.

161
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:12,514
Now, let's go and win
this election.

162
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:14,316
Right.

163
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:21,789
We're making good time.

164
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:35,537
He's got all
the early voters.

165
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:38,273
How exactly is the intellectual
giant in plus fours?

166
00:11:38,274 --> 00:11:40,041
Kilwillie?

167
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,610
He's smarter
than he looks.

168
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:44,212
He's diversified
into luxury foods.

169
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:47,582
Everything from whisky
marmalade to venison pate.

170
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,518
- He employs a lot of people.
- Who'll all vote for him.

171
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,920
Still, looks from these
like you might pick up

172
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,623
Most of the
O.A.P. Vote.

173
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:56,791
- I'm pleased about that.
- It's often the way.

174
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:59,093
Old ladies usually
admire female candidates.

175
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,028
Old blokes just
fancy them.

176
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,231
As long as they're not
complete dogs, of course.

177
00:12:03,232 --> 00:12:04,733
- Alan!
- Oh, sorry.

178
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:07,269
Gratuitous use of
politically incorrect term.

179
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,104
So, when are the oldies going to vote?

180
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:13,141
- Most of them said they were going to go tonight.
- That's no good.

181
00:12:13,142 --> 00:12:15,410
Tonight they'll be
watching "Gardener's World"

182
00:12:15,411 --> 00:12:17,479
Or fretting about
the mass murderers

183
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,648
Stalking the mean streets of Glenbogle.

184
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:21,716
You've got to get them
voting during the day.

185
00:12:21,717 --> 00:12:24,085
I can't get them lifts
during the day.

186
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:26,187
People round here
are really busy just now.

187
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:27,889
It's the 12th of August.

188
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,024
Oh, aye. Mass murder
of another kind.

189
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:32,193
So what are we
gonna do?

190
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:37,965
Alan.

191
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:42,236
No.

192
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:47,842
Ahoy, lads.

193
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:00,955

197
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,507
She's got a bit
of a sore throat.

Four dozen brace of birds

205
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:40,695
Sorry, old man.

206
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,964

208
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:47,335
Yeah.

209
00:13:47,336 --> 00:13:48,837
What?

210
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:51,239
I'm on my way.

211
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,875
- What are you doing now?
- Crisis looms.

212
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:56,711
The barbarians are
hammering at the gates.

213
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:59,313
Couldn't they have had the
decency to choose another day?

214
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:02,049
I need the help of an

218
00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:40,154
You've ruined me strawberry
surprise. It's full of dust and grass.

219
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:42,824
It wouldn't be full
of strawberries, would it?

220
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:46,828
- Are you Scottish?
- What d'you want me to do? Dance an eightsome reel?

221
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:49,096
I can't believe this.
Excuse me.

222
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,232
Could you tell us
where we are, please?

223
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:54,402
You're asking me? What's this, then, D
- Day for the jocks?

224
00:14:54,403 --> 00:14:56,237
Where's the nearest
railway station?

225
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:58,973
Ah, Carlisle.
40 miles that way.

226
00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:01,876
God's own country,
60 miles that way.

227
00:15:01,877 --> 00:15:05,046
You'd think they'd put a sign up,
wouldn't you? "Knackered bridge ahead. "

228
00:15:08,684 --> 00:15:10,652
What are we
gonna do, Arch?

229
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:12,754
We need a car. We'll have
to hire one or something.

230
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:16,791
- Or get a lift.
- Some turnip told me that was the short cut to the motorway.

231
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,160
Oh, no.

232
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:21,596
What better way to keep
the fish and game cold?

233
00:15:21,597 --> 00:15:24,599
Anyway, you got
a better idea?

234
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:30,071
We just thought you might
appreciate a lift, Mrs. McGregor.

235
00:15:30,072 --> 00:15:32,206
Thank you, dear,
that's very kind of you.

236
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:34,342
Oh my goodness me.

237
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:37,779
Good morning, madam. I'm
your driver, Freddie Jorg.

238
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,747
Good morning.

239
00:15:39,748 --> 00:15:42,517
Tell me, have you ever ridden
on a Harley Davidson before?

240
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:46,053
- Oh no.
- Mrs. McGregor!

241
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:48,022
Hello, my dear.

242
00:15:49,892 --> 00:15:52,994
You are looking well,
I must say.

243
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,997
And getting bonnier with every
passing day, if I may venture.

244
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,434
We were just popping down to
the village in the old charabanc.

245
00:16:00,435 --> 00:16:03,104
Can we convey you in that
general direction?

246
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:05,139
That's very
kind of you,

247
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,075
But ever since
I saw "Easy Rider,"

248
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:11,278
I've wanted to burn
rubber on one of these.

249
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:14,415
<i>( motorcycle starts )</i>

250
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,552
So there's petrol, damaged
stock, loss of sales-

251
00:16:17,553 --> 00:16:20,154
Loss of sales? Geordie,
you've not made any.

252
00:16:20,155 --> 00:16:22,924
Even if we were in a Ferrari, we still
wouldn't make it in time for lunch.

253
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:25,426
Time, travel expenses.
Let's say 300.

254
00:16:25,427 --> 00:16:27,595
No, let's say 150.

255
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:31,699
Freddie: No, every year
the club organizes a tour

256
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,236
And we all take a week off work to go
and do wheelies in some far-off place.

257
00:16:35,237 --> 00:16:37,605
We're very grateful
for your help.

258
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:40,174
If there's anything we can do to reimburse your expenses

259
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:42,176
Oh, not at all,
wouldn't hear of it.

260
00:16:42,177 --> 00:16:44,679
No, we'll simply finish off
the list and then be on our way.

261
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,448
We want to make Loch Ness
before teatime.

262
00:16:55,991 --> 00:16:59,427
That would have looked a bit odd
on the election expenses return.

263
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:02,564
"Petrol money for Bank of
England Harley Davidson Club. "

264
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:05,499
Gloves off, I think.

265
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,302
- If they will march into Poland.
- Quite.

266
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:11,839
There are some things up
with which one shall not put.

267
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,678
They'll all melt.
It's such a waste.

268
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,513
- Just great.
- Oh, Saturn Rockets!


269
00:17:19,514 --> 00:17:22,249
Oh, I've not had these
since I was a wee girl.

00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,733
- See you this evening. Bye.
- How's it looking?

274
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:42,036
Packed. Word's got round
the exiles, I think.

275
00:17:42,037 --> 00:17:44,538
- This, er, Lesley.
- Lexie.

276
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:47,108
She is only gonna do her
nauseating national dish, right?

277
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,143
Because you've never
cooked grouse before.

278
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:50,411
Yes, that's the arrangement.

279
00:17:50,412 --> 00:17:52,279
And you're sure
she won't meddle?

280
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,482
'cause I won't have it.
You know me, I'm a pussycat,

281
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:57,184
But if anyone comes into my
kitchen and starts messing around...

282
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:59,286
It's not gonna happen,
trust me.

283
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,422
Anyway, you'll like her.

284
00:18:01,423 --> 00:18:03,591
She's very nice...
In an up front sort of way.

Archie,
are you nearly here?

288
00:18:14,603 --> 00:18:16,104
What?

289
00:18:17,205 --> 00:18:19,107
Where?

290
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:20,908
Archie.

291
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:23,511
We're all okay,
in case you were wondering.

292
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:26,914
- Yes, Justine, I know that very well.
- That his missus, is it?

293
00:18:26,915 --> 00:18:29,250
- She wants to be.
- I appreciate that.

294
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:31,352
Starting as she
means to go on?

295
00:18:31,353 --> 00:18:33,554
Why don't you tell her
to get stuffed,

296
00:18:33,555 --> 00:18:35,589
Get off the phone,
get some housework done.

297
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,424
What did they say?

00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:39,293
<i>Nothing,
I'll tell you later.</i>

299
00:18:39,294 --> 00:18:41,595
So what will you do
about lunch?

00:18:41,596 --> 00:18:44,165
What I normally do

301
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,901
Hope Lennie can pull
a rabbit out of the hat.

302
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:48,970
In this case,
almost literally.

303
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:54,776
Don't say anything.

304
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:57,779
Just get into that kitchen
and do whatever you have to do.

A ladder

- Watford.

Fascinating reading,

Some folks study the Bible,
others pore over mucky books.

316

Me, I go for
canvassing returns.

317
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,157
I could never get you this interested
in me when we were together.

318
00:20:16,158 --> 00:20:19,393
Maybe I have repented
at leisure.

Come into my kitchen.

Nice place, Archie.

The paintings,
the color scheme,

341
00:21:42,044 --> 00:21:44,178
The tablecloths.
It's completely different.

342
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,315
Don't be ridiculous.
The customers like it.

343
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:50,551
And my aquarium.
Where is my aquarium?

344
00:21:50,552 --> 00:21:52,153
- It had to go.
- Why?

345
00:21:52,154 --> 00:21:54,989
One of the piranhas bit Terry's hand
when he was cleaning out the tank.

346
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,859
<i>- What have you done with them?
- The wound went septic.</i>

347
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,062
<i>- Terry had to be off work for a week.
- Where are my fish?</i>

348
00:22:01,063 --> 00:22:04,165
- Lennie let them go.
- What? Oh, not down the-

349
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,833
- No!
- Well, where?

350
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:08,035
Just by London Bridge.

351
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:10,171
It was really neat
the way they swam off.

352
00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:12,706
I know it wasn't the most
ecologically sound thing to do,

353
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:15,642
- But they were free at last,
the open sea. - Lennie- shut up.

354
00:22:15,643 --> 00:22:19,113
We'd better get going if we're going to
be ready for this evening's performance.

355
00:22:19,114 --> 00:22:21,382
- I can't believe you've done this.
- And I can't believe

356
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:24,418
- You walk in and start throwing your weight about.
- Justine.

357
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:26,453
We can't sort
this out now.

358
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:28,856
There's too much
to do before tonight.

359
00:22:28,857 --> 00:22:30,992
It'll have to wait.

360
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:43,271
<i>Alan: So that's the wrinklies sorted...</i>

361
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:46,473
Young moms just about done,
working men'll vote tonight.

362
00:22:46,474 --> 00:22:49,243
- What about the unemployed?
- What about them?

363
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,979
You'll never get on in politics
if you take that attitude, dear.

364
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,716
- You must at least pretend to care.
- You mean like you do?

365
00:22:55,717 --> 00:22:57,684
We haven't had many
of them voting yet.

366
00:22:57,685 --> 00:23:00,154
- Most of them are working today.
- They're unemployed!

367
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:02,456
Casual work. They're
beating up on the hill.

368
00:23:02,457 --> 00:23:04,992
- I beg your pardon?
- For the grouse shooting.

369
00:23:04,993 --> 00:23:08,429
Aaah, the bizarre
feudal relic.

370
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,732
- Speaking of which...
- Don't talk about Molly like that, she's my friend.

371
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:13,667
- Oh, hang on.
- Wha-what?

372
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:16,237
- Voter at 11:00.
- Oh, it's only Molly.

373
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,506
Oh. Hello, Katrina.

374
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:27,181
Oh, good afternoon, dear.
Kilwillie.

375
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:31,285
Alan.

376
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:32,920
See you in a moment,
everyone.

377
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:34,721
Right-o.

378
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,465
- Those the grouses, are they?
- Grice.

379
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:47,001
- Eh?
- The plural of grouse is grice.

380
00:23:47,002 --> 00:23:49,703
- It's like mouse and mice.
- Oh, right.

381
00:23:49,704 --> 00:23:52,539
- ( chuckles )
- stink a bit, don't they?

382
00:23:53,842 --> 00:23:56,844
And these-
farm salmon, are they?

383
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:58,512
They are not!

384
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:01,182
Wild atlantic salmon,
caught this very morning

385
00:24:01,183 --> 00:24:04,085
In the crystal waters of the River Bogle
- by your boss.

386
00:24:04,086 --> 00:24:06,653
I don't like it when salmon
gets this big. Taste's gone.

387
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,956
Lennie, you're talking
100% fish droppings.

388
00:24:08,957 --> 00:24:12,059
- Archie.
- Sorry, "boss," just expressing a professional opinion.

389
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,362
There's a lot of
paperwork to get through.

390
00:24:16,198 --> 00:24:19,000
I could chop them
into steaks, I suppose.

391
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:21,502
Okay. I think the flavor's more delicate

392
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,804
If they're cut into
fillets, myself. But it's-

393
00:24:23,805 --> 00:24:26,407
Why don't you leave the
delicate flavors to me, sweetie,

394
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:28,909
While you get to grips
with the grice, eh?

395
00:24:30,412 --> 00:24:32,380
Shall I chin him
now or later?

396
00:24:32,381 --> 00:24:34,482
- Hey, Geordie.
- What?

397
00:24:34,483 --> 00:24:38,519
"What did the grape say
when the gorilla stood on it?"

398
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,454
I don't know, Lexie.

399
00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:42,856
What did the grape say when
the gorilla stood on it?

400
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:45,159
Nothing. It just gave
a little "wine. "

401
00:24:50,965 --> 00:24:53,000
Oh, Molly,
dear.

402
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:54,868
Be with you
in a minute.

403
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:57,304
What are you doing
consorting with the enemy?

404
00:24:57,305 --> 00:24:59,907
What are you boys doing here? I
thought you were out playing popguns.

405
00:24:59,908 --> 00:25:02,376
A good candidate's got
to keep his finger

406
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:04,245
On the pulse of the
electoral process, Molly.

407
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:06,547
Thank his supporters
and so on.

408
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,582
<i>I trust you, er...</i>

409
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:12,286
- No, of course, mustn't ask.
- What?

410
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:15,923
Well, that I...
Well, you know...

411
00:25:15,924 --> 00:25:18,225
Don't be ridiculous, man.
Do you honestly think

412
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,261
A wife of mine would
vote for a woman?

413
00:25:20,262 --> 00:25:23,264
Don't you worry your little
bald head, Kilwillie.

414
00:25:23,265 --> 00:25:25,466
I voted according
to my conscience.

415
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:27,668
Thank you so much, Molly.

416
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:30,371
Well, see you boys later.

417
00:25:30,372 --> 00:25:33,640
And don't stay cooped up in the
motor all day, get some fresh air.

418
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,311
She's a wonderful girl.

419
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:40,114
- You're a lucky dog, Hector.
- Yeah.

420
00:25:41,216 --> 00:25:43,150
Well, I did it.

421
00:25:43,151 --> 00:25:46,954
For the first time in my life,
I exercised my democratic rights

422
00:25:46,955 --> 00:25:49,323
According to my own
convictions

423
00:25:49,324 --> 00:25:51,392
Rather than my husband's
prejudices.

424
00:25:51,393 --> 00:25:53,461
I put a cross
against your name.

425
00:25:53,462 --> 00:25:56,697
Really, Molly?
Thank you.

426
00:25:56,698 --> 00:25:59,200
See, I told you.

427
00:25:59,201 --> 00:26:01,602
( exhales )
truly liberating.

428
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,370
And the ladies
in my lottery syndicate

429
00:26:03,371 --> 00:26:05,473
Were very taken
with your leaflets.

430
00:26:05,474 --> 00:26:08,142
Tell me,
are you winning?

431
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:10,411
I hope so.
We were just wondering

432
00:26:10,412 --> 00:26:12,346
What time are the beaters
on the hill finishing?

433
00:26:12,347 --> 00:26:14,415
About 6:00,
I should think.

434
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:16,550
Plenty of time
to vote, then.

435
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:18,719
No, no, hold on.
Golly always lays on

436
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,155
A ceilidh for them and
the other estate workers.

437
00:26:21,156 --> 00:26:22,956
Whiskey flows
till midnight.

438
00:26:24,726 --> 00:26:27,027
Archie counting:
... 20, 140 and 50.

439
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:29,296
Thanks, Archie.
Top lad.

440
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:31,398
Thanks for having
such a cheerful face.

441
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:33,167
You're a canny-looking
lad yourself.

442
00:26:33,168 --> 00:26:35,202
I'll shake your hand-
I'll be off.

443
00:26:35,203 --> 00:26:37,304
<i>- Thanks, son.
- Justine: Archie?</i>

444
00:26:39,274 --> 00:26:41,074
Here. Take this.

445
00:26:41,075 --> 00:26:43,410
I was gonna give it to
Waltzing Matilda in there

446
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:45,546
- But I'd rather you had it.
- Thanks, pet.

447
00:26:45,547 --> 00:26:48,449
It's ages since I've slurped the
old fire water. Thanks very much.

448
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,018
Pop round later on and I'll
give you a grouse buttie.

449
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:53,154
Thanks.

450
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:56,056
If this is democracy,
you can keep it.

451
00:26:56,057 --> 00:26:58,592
I've never been
so bored in my life.

452
00:26:58,593 --> 00:27:01,562
Voting is a bit slow,
I must say.

453
00:27:01,563 --> 00:27:04,165
That's because people
have better things to do,

454
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,233
As have you and me!

455
00:27:06,234 --> 00:27:08,636
This is a terrible waste
of the Glorious 12th.

456
00:27:08,637 --> 00:27:11,572
The opposition does seem
rather inactive.

457
00:27:11,573 --> 00:27:14,908
Perhaps we could spare
just a couple of hours.

458
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:16,877
Splendid.

459
00:27:24,452 --> 00:27:27,688
Katrina:
Wait for it.

460
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:30,057
Wait for it.

461
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:31,792
Go.

462
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:10,797
Man: Katrina, Mrs. MacDonald.
What are you doing down here?

463
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:13,166
- We've come to take your jobs, Gary.
- Huh?

464
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:15,603
- What she means is that-
- we need you to go and vote.

465
00:28:15,604 --> 00:28:17,871
But we're working.
We're about to-

466
00:28:17,872 --> 00:28:20,341
- We're going to do it for you.
- What, you?

467
00:28:20,342 --> 00:28:22,610
Come on, Gary,
it's hardly rocket science.

468
00:28:22,611 --> 00:28:24,811
Walking up a hillside,
waving a stick

469
00:28:24,812 --> 00:28:27,180
And screaming obscenities
at flocks of birds.

470
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:29,783
<i>Duncan:
One, two, three.</i>

471
00:28:29,784 --> 00:28:32,486
<i>Are you there, guys?</i>

472
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,429
This is
more like it.

473
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:46,533
Splendid.

474
00:28:48,503 --> 00:28:50,471
That's it, girls.

475
00:28:50,472 --> 00:28:52,205
Keep a steady pace.

476
00:28:53,642 --> 00:28:55,809
<i>( women cooing like birds )</i>

477
00:28:58,846 --> 00:29:00,714
Keep apart.

478
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:28,442
Canny.

479
00:29:28,443 --> 00:29:31,445
This is the profit
and loss account for June.

480
00:29:31,446 --> 00:29:34,181
We made a thumping
great deficit?

481
00:29:34,182 --> 00:29:38,151
No. Don't you remember we make
the loan repayments every quarter?

482
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:41,121
Once that figure there is
amortized over the other months,

483
00:29:41,122 --> 00:29:43,857
We were in profit-
just.

484
00:29:43,858 --> 00:29:46,360
Oh yeah, sorry, I forgot.
I'm a bit rusty.

485
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:48,562
That's good.
Great, in fact.

486
00:29:48,563 --> 00:29:50,631
Thank you, o master.

487
00:29:50,632 --> 00:29:54,067
It hasn't been easy, but
everyone's pulled together.

488
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:56,670
Yeah.

489
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:59,139
Oh, Justine,
I miss this place.

490
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:02,042
Do you?
Really?

491
00:30:02,043 --> 00:30:03,811
And you.

492
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:06,146
Well, get yourself
back down here then.

493
00:30:06,147 --> 00:30:08,482
I will.

494
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:11,151
I will.

495
00:30:17,826 --> 00:30:19,593
It's showtime.

496
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,809
( diners chatting )

497
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,778
What can I get you?

498
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:40,748
Everyone wants
the grouse.

499
00:30:40,749 --> 00:30:42,850
How's it going?

500
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:45,085
The oven's not hot enough
and I can't get it higher.

501
00:30:45,086 --> 00:30:47,087
- I told him.
- I'm using the others.

502
00:30:47,088 --> 00:30:49,423
- The birds aren't cooking.
- This is the simmering oven.

503
00:30:49,424 --> 00:30:51,992
<i>- Lennie, what the hell are you playing at?
- Come on, Archie.</i>

504
00:30:51,993 --> 00:30:55,829
- Stop messing about and give Lexie an oven
to cook in! - You listen to me, mate...

505
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:01,702
Come on, there are
customers waiting.

506
00:31:22,557 --> 00:31:24,491
Oh!

507
00:31:24,492 --> 00:31:27,694
- Watch out!
- You stupid cow.

508
00:31:27,695 --> 00:31:30,464
What did you call me? You
puffed up bag of antipodean wind.

509
00:31:30,465 --> 00:31:33,634
- That is it, I've had enough! - And it's
high time someone stuck a pin in you.

510
00:31:33,635 --> 00:31:36,136
- Come on, guys.
- An accident, these things happen.

511
00:31:36,137 --> 00:31:38,906
No more favors, Justine.
She goes or I walk.

512
00:31:38,907 --> 00:31:41,442
I mean it. It's my kitchen!
I will not have her in it!

513
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:44,277
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
- That's just because I showed you up

514
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:48,081
- For the talentless ego merchant
that you are. - Who's it to be? Her or me?

515
00:31:48,082 --> 00:31:50,717
Okay.
I'm sorry, Lexie.

516
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:55,989
Justine, this is not
your decision.

517
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,291
Yes, it is.
Pick those birds up.

518
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,327
Someone's got to
eat them in a minute.

519
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:07,668
- Justine, we run this restaurant
together- - no we don't!

520
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:10,604
<i>We used to until you went off to your
Highland fastness to play chieftain.</i>

521
00:32:10,605 --> 00:32:13,874
Now I run it! With a lot of
help and support from Lennie.

522
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:16,209
What kind of help
and support would that be?

523
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,745
Maybe the same kind as you
get from Lexie. Or Katrina.

524
00:32:18,746 --> 00:32:21,414
Or whichever other Highland lassie
you're tossing the caber with.

525
00:32:21,415 --> 00:32:23,283
Look, Justine,
we are partners.

526
00:32:23,284 --> 00:32:24,918
<i>We used to be, Archie.</i>

527
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:27,287
But maybe,
as the old song says,

528
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:29,022
It's time to call
the whole thing off.

529
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:33,527
- ( door slams )
- evening.

530
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:37,464
Excuse me, pet.

531
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:43,269
( slurring )
you know, my dad...

532
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:45,305
<i>Used to build ships.</i>

533
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:49,042
I sell ice cream.

534
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:53,113
Mr. Slurpy...

535
00:32:53,114 --> 00:32:55,015
At your service.

536
00:33:01,455 --> 00:33:04,391
Is this like
dinner theatre?

537
00:33:06,895 --> 00:33:09,596
Marvelous day. Well done,
Duncan. Jolly good show.

538
00:33:09,597 --> 00:33:11,498
Thanks very much,
Hector.

539
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:15,335
Right.
I must be off.

540
00:33:15,336 --> 00:33:17,203
Compose my
victory speech.

541
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,908
Jolly good beaters
you found, too.

542
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:23,844
I tell you what...
Give them this fiver,

543
00:33:23,845 --> 00:33:26,079
Tell them to have
a drink on me.

544
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:30,684
That'll be just the one drink
between all of them, will it?

545
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,590
Guys! Guys!
Hey, boys.

546
00:33:49,604 --> 00:33:51,504
Aye?

547
00:33:51,505 --> 00:33:53,907
Yes.

548
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:56,577
You can say that again.

549
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:58,478
But don't.

550
00:33:58,479 --> 00:34:00,914
I've got
a terrible headache.

551
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:03,650
I suppose I could go back
in there and apologize.

552
00:34:03,651 --> 00:34:06,053
- Say it was all my fault.
- Archie, son,

553
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:10,223
It's around these small
moments whole lives hinge.

554
00:34:10,224 --> 00:34:12,459
What?

555
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,795
I speak from
experience, man.

556
00:34:14,796 --> 00:34:17,130
12 years since I caught
the bus to Blyth...

557
00:34:17,131 --> 00:34:19,933
I was daft enough to sit next
to a lass who smiled at us.

558
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:22,903
If only I'd had another
half in the "fat ox"

559
00:34:22,904 --> 00:34:24,972
Or the bus had been late, or I'd sat

560
00:34:24,973 --> 00:34:27,440
In the back with my
"Chronicle," like I usually did,

561
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:32,378
I'd have been spared a
lifetime of quiet misery

562
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:35,281
With a large woman

563
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:37,918
With a very short
temper.

564
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:40,453
I see.

565
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:43,556
If I was you,
I'd stay where you are,

566
00:34:43,557 --> 00:34:45,892
Have some fun
with that Lexie lass.

567
00:34:45,893 --> 00:34:48,328
I tell you she fancies
the posh pants off you.

568
00:34:49,897 --> 00:34:53,033
Right, that's everything.
Next stop, Euston.

569
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,608
Like a well-oiled
machine, it was.

570
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:04,244
Well, I'm glad the nice
gentlemen had a good day.

571
00:35:04,245 --> 00:35:07,648
Always been good tippers,
the Norwegians.

572
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:10,550
I'll trouble you
for my share.

573
00:35:13,587 --> 00:35:16,089
And I'll have my
binoculars back as well.

574
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:20,927
You be a good lad
in the next 12 months

575
00:35:20,928 --> 00:35:23,329
And I'll let you play with
the train set next year, too.

576
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,598
Sweetie?

577
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:35,142
Here, take it.
You did well.

578
00:35:35,143 --> 00:35:37,277
Val Doonican would
be proud of you.

579
00:35:37,278 --> 00:35:39,946
"walk tall,
walk straight... "

580
00:35:39,947 --> 00:35:42,348
- "and look the world right in the eye. "
- bingo.

581
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:49,255
- This is it.
- For both of us?

582
00:35:49,256 --> 00:35:51,324
It was the only one
they had left.

583
00:35:51,325 --> 00:35:53,426
It's okay,
I'll go on top.

584
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:55,662
Oh, bunk, that is.

585
00:35:55,663 --> 00:35:57,731
Should have left
that tequila alone.

586
00:35:57,732 --> 00:36:00,967
I'm starving, and all that
food we brought down...

587
00:36:00,968 --> 00:36:03,737
Don't worry,
I nicked these and...

588
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:07,741
The most expensive bottle
of red wine in your cellar.

589
00:36:07,742 --> 00:36:10,777
"and they dined on mince
and slices of quince... "

590
00:36:12,613 --> 00:36:15,448
So, the husband says, "I've
just been talking to the milkman,

591
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:17,684
And he says he's slept
with every woman

592
00:36:17,685 --> 00:36:20,153
In this street except one. "
and the wife says-

593
00:36:20,154 --> 00:36:23,090
"I bet it's that stuck up
cow from number 17."

594
00:36:23,091 --> 00:36:25,358
I absolutely hate it
when you do that.

595
00:36:29,697 --> 00:36:31,698
Here's to you,

596
00:36:31,699 --> 00:36:35,401
And the start of a
glittering political career.

597
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:42,408
Thanks, Alan.

598
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,144
For everything.

599
00:36:46,214 --> 00:36:48,348
Isn't democracy
wonderful?

600
00:36:49,784 --> 00:36:52,385
I love being a carnivore, don't you?

601
00:36:52,386 --> 00:36:54,621
It's a bit overdone,
but it's not bad.

602
00:36:57,959 --> 00:37:00,293
Right.
Turn around.

603
00:37:02,797 --> 00:37:05,232
I'm going to retire.
It's been a long day.

604
00:37:07,969 --> 00:37:10,303
- Stop looking.
- I'm not looking.

605
00:37:10,304 --> 00:37:12,538
I am. Oh!

606
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:15,308
My, Archie MacDonald-
Calvin Kleins.

607
00:37:21,883 --> 00:37:23,950
I have to get back
to Edinburgh.

608
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:26,853
- Aye.
- What time's the count start?

609
00:37:26,854 --> 00:37:28,855
8:00 in the morning.

610
00:37:28,856 --> 00:37:30,791
- Why don't you...
- Why don't I...

611
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,358
After you.

612
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:34,661
I was just gonna say,
why don't you stay?

613
00:37:34,662 --> 00:37:37,264
See it through
to the bitter end?

614
00:37:37,265 --> 00:37:40,167
Okay, thanks. But I'd
better get my head down.

615
00:37:40,168 --> 00:37:42,035
I've been up since
the crack of dawn.

616
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:44,171
I'll get you a duvet.

617
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,517
Okay, I'm listening.

618
00:37:57,518 --> 00:37:59,652
What's there
to say, Archie?

619
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:04,124
<i>- What's there to say?
- I don't know.</i>

620
00:38:06,894 --> 00:38:09,262
Just feels like
it's gone,

621
00:38:09,263 --> 00:38:11,497
The dream we had.

622
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:15,802
It feels like someone's taken
a baseball bat to it.

623
00:38:17,138 --> 00:38:19,739
And maybe that someone
is you.

624
00:38:22,243 --> 00:38:25,645
<i>- Hello?
- I hear what you're saying.</i>

625
00:38:25,646 --> 00:38:27,981
Don't say that.

626
00:38:27,982 --> 00:38:30,317
I hate it
when people say that.

627
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:32,518
They mean, "I hear what
you're saying

628
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,988
But I'm going to do
naff all about it. "

629
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:36,689
<i>No, I just meant-</i>

630
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,925
( phone disconnects )

631
00:38:52,673 --> 00:38:55,308
Hello? Hello?

632
00:38:57,111 --> 00:38:59,279
I'm sorry, Arch.

633
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,447
I bet you could
do with a cuddle.

634
00:39:01,448 --> 00:39:04,450
- I know I could.
- Lexie, no.

635
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:06,552
- It's okay.
- This isn't wise.

636
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,555
A cuddle, I said.
We've got our jim-jams on.

637
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:13,126
Anyway, I'm freezing. It's like
camp three on everest up there.

638
00:39:13,127 --> 00:39:16,529
- Your feet, they're freezing, Lexie!
- Move over!

639
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,499
There...

640
00:39:20,935 --> 00:39:22,769
That's better.

641
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:32,678
You know, I feel kinda
sorry for Justine.

642
00:39:33,948 --> 00:39:36,283
I know she's got
her faults but...

643
00:39:36,284 --> 00:39:38,952
Everybody's got their
faults, haven't they?

644
00:39:38,953 --> 00:39:41,221
And you've got
your faults.

645
00:39:41,222 --> 00:39:43,924
Even I've got faults.

646
00:39:47,228 --> 00:39:49,796
I just feel
bad for her.

647
00:39:49,797 --> 00:39:52,598
I mean, she's losing
her man, isn't she?

648
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,001
Maybe.

649
00:40:01,842 --> 00:40:03,509
Hey, Arch...

650
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,646
What did one ghost
say to the other?

651
00:40:06,647 --> 00:40:08,514
Dunno.

652
00:40:08,515 --> 00:40:10,250
Do you believe in people?

653
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:17,924
We just never really had a
chance to talk it through...

654
00:40:19,093 --> 00:40:21,995
See how we feel,
reach common ground.

655
00:40:23,397 --> 00:40:25,465
That's important,
don't you think?

656
00:40:29,837 --> 00:40:33,440
It's okay, I always have
this effect on women in bed.

657
00:40:41,048 --> 00:40:42,882
( ringing )

658
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,621
Hello.

659
00:40:48,622 --> 00:40:50,590
Hello?

660
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:04,437
I'm sorry, I didn't think, I was asleep.

661
00:41:04,438 --> 00:41:08,208
Whoever it was
rang off anyway.

662
00:41:08,209 --> 00:41:11,311
I wonder who it was.

663
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:16,149
<i>Something wrong?</i>

664
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,018
Can't sleep.

665
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:20,420
Too excited.
Too nervous.

666
00:41:20,421 --> 00:41:23,356
You'll walk it.
Just trust your uncle Alan.

667
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:29,062
You can be very sweet
when you put your mind to it.

668
00:41:29,063 --> 00:41:30,997
Is that supposed to be
a compliment?

669
00:41:30,998 --> 00:41:33,900
It's the only one
you're getting.

670
00:41:33,901 --> 00:41:37,670
So why don't you stop
messing about and kiss me?

671
00:41:54,688 --> 00:41:58,591
What d'you fancy,
hot chocolate or Horlicks?

672
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:00,293
It doesn't matter.

673
00:42:00,294 --> 00:42:02,262
Just put some bromide
in it, will you?

674
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:21,948
( moans )

675
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:33,960
( giggles )

676
00:42:41,168 --> 00:42:44,070
- Lexie!
- Who did you think it was?

677
00:42:44,071 --> 00:42:46,506
- We can't do this.
- You're not enjoying it,

678
00:42:46,507 --> 00:42:49,041
- Is that what you're trying to tell me?
- No, but...

679
00:42:50,511 --> 00:42:52,612
- What are you doing?
- Where are we?

680
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:54,947
I want to know
where it happened.

681
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:57,016
Penrith!

682
00:42:57,017 --> 00:42:59,051
You know, that's where
Bonnie Prince Charlie

683
00:42:59,052 --> 00:43:01,053
Fought his last battle
in England.

684
00:43:01,054 --> 00:43:03,623
- You're not getting back in this bed.
- Oh, come on.

685
00:43:03,624 --> 00:43:05,891
No, think how you'll feel
in the morning.

686
00:43:05,892 --> 00:43:08,761
Oh, trust you to go
all manly and decisive

687
00:43:08,762 --> 00:43:10,696
At this stage
in the proceedings.

688
00:43:20,073 --> 00:43:22,609
<i>Hector: But I've got
work to do this morning.</i>

689
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:25,945
Surely your golf column in the "Horse
and Hound" can wait a few hours, Hector.

690
00:43:25,946 --> 00:43:27,547
But where
are we going?

691
00:43:27,548 --> 00:43:29,582
To the count
for the election.

692
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:31,684
Katrina and Kilwillie.

693
00:43:31,685 --> 00:43:33,719
Oh, yes, election, yeah.

694
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,988
I forgot to vote
for the blighter, you know.

695
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:38,224
I've a feeling
about today, Hector.

696
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:41,093
We're standing
on the threshold of history.

697
00:43:41,094 --> 00:43:43,796
Centuries of oppression
are about to end.

698
00:43:43,797 --> 00:43:46,566
You're not suggesting you voted
for that girl, are you?

699
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:48,301
Hector, dear,

700
00:43:48,302 --> 00:43:51,437
There are days in life
in which one is the fly,

701
00:43:51,438 --> 00:43:53,573
And rare, magical moments

702
00:43:53,574 --> 00:43:56,842
In which one is
at long last the windscreen.

703
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,944
- Come on.
- What windscreen?

704
00:43:58,945 --> 00:44:01,481
Has Duncan been messing about
with that Land Rover again?

705
00:44:10,724 --> 00:44:13,726
Okay?

706
00:44:13,727 --> 00:44:16,196
I'm never mixing red
wine and tequila again.

707
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:20,433
Listen,
about last night...

708
00:44:22,536 --> 00:44:24,637
Thanks very much.

709
00:44:24,638 --> 00:44:26,606
- My pleasure.
- No, it wasn't.

710
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:31,777
Anyway,
you're a gentleman.

711
00:44:31,778 --> 00:44:35,348
Showing your breeding,
Archie MacDonald.

712
00:44:38,352 --> 00:44:41,287
Still, it wasn't
a bad snog, was it?

713
00:44:41,288 --> 00:44:43,690
No, Lexie, it was
a damn fine snog.

714
00:44:49,763 --> 00:44:51,864
Maybe we'll get
another chance-

715
00:44:51,865 --> 00:44:53,700
When I'm not half pished.

716
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:57,837
Come on, let's go home.

717
00:45:01,575 --> 00:45:03,976
I feel like we're
in that old movie.

718
00:45:03,977 --> 00:45:07,280
What was it?
"Short Encounter. "

719
00:45:19,893 --> 00:45:22,495
Man: Have you any idea when
we might expect a result?

720
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:33,273
Can you take us to the
community center first, please?

721
00:45:37,844 --> 00:45:40,112
You don't mind,
do you?

722
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:44,884
Dougal henderson:
214.

723
00:45:49,189 --> 00:45:52,592
Angus Archibald
Kilwillie:

724
00:45:52,593 --> 00:45:56,362
<i>782.</i>

725
00:46:02,536 --> 00:46:05,137
<i>Katrina Finlay...</i>

726
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:07,640
<i>1000...</i>

727
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:08,741
( cheering )

728
00:46:12,112 --> 00:46:14,781
<i>...And 23.</i>

729
00:46:14,782 --> 00:46:17,483
What is the world
coming to?

730
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:23,255
<i>I hereby declare that
Katrina Finlay</i>

731
00:46:23,256 --> 00:46:25,825
Has been duly elected
to serve as a member

732
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:29,429
Of the Highland Council
for the Glenbogle ward.

733
00:46:35,969 --> 00:46:38,504
<i>Molly:
My dear...</i>

734
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:40,807
You've done so well.

735
00:46:40,808 --> 00:46:42,842
Well done.

736
00:46:44,578 --> 00:46:47,947
See? I told you I could do it
without the help of the MacDonalds.

737
00:46:47,948 --> 00:46:50,916
- The men anyway.
- What do you mean? I voted for you.

738
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:55,054
Did you? I didn't know
that. Why didn't you tell me?

739
00:46:55,055 --> 00:46:57,557
Katrina, I'm sure
you'll do a good job.

740
00:46:57,558 --> 00:47:00,493
How did it go with Justine?

741
00:47:05,131 --> 00:47:07,266
Your speech.

742
00:47:28,689 --> 00:47:31,957
First of all, I'd like to thank
the returning officer...
