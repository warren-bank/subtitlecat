00:00:00,866 --> 00:00:02,467
( laughing )

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,403
Ah, thanks, Robbie.
Wonderful job, as ever.

3
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:09,705
Thank you
very much, sir.

4
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:11,306
Next.

5
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:15,444
Actually, I think I'll
come back another time.

6
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:17,980
<i>Robbie: As you wish.
Would any of you gentlemen</i>

7
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:20,016
be wanting something
for the weekend?

8
00:00:20,017 --> 00:00:24,020
The usual, Robbie, a six-pound
line and a packet of hooks.

9
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:27,356
Who'd have thought it? A grown man
frightened of having his hair cut.

10
00:00:27,357 --> 00:00:30,259
I don't mind having a haircut.
I just don't want that one.

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,362
We're going to a funeral. It's a
mark of respect. Speak to him, Golly.

12
00:00:33,363 --> 00:00:37,533
He's old enough to know his
own mind. Where is Duncan?

13
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:40,436
Can I help?
Only you look lost.

14
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:42,471
I'm just waiting
for my mother.

15
00:00:42,472 --> 00:00:44,540
<i>Duncan: You're up here
on holiday, I expect?</i>

16
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,877
- My granddad's being buried today.
- Oh, sorry.

17
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,246
Not howard mcrae?
I'm coming to that myself.

18
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:53,082
Oh, well...

19
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,918
I'm sure you'll be
a great comfort to us all.

20
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:57,587
Gotta go.

21
00:01:00,523 --> 00:01:02,892
Duncan: I'll be seeing you there, then?

22
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:14,870
Who's your friend?

23
00:01:14,871 --> 00:01:17,907
She didn't say.
Pretty lassie, though, eh?

24
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:19,709
Doesn't take after
her father then.

25
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,511
- Who is he?
- You're looking at him.

26
00:01:26,116 --> 00:01:28,784
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

27
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:05,655
You're joking, aren't you?
And you can forget that.

28
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:07,723
We certainly
don't need this.

29
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:10,359
Dublin Bay oysters?

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,663
You put those on the order,
they'll come out of your wages.

31
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:16,298
That is Hector's friday treat.
Tell her, Arch.

32
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:19,802
He can manage without them.
We all have to make sacrifices.

33
00:02:19,803 --> 00:02:21,771
Thanks...

34
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:23,205
for nothing.

35
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,809
<i>( door slams )</i>

36
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:31,147
A bill
from the florist?

37
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:34,616
I ordered a wreath
for the funeral.

38
00:02:34,617 --> 00:02:36,518
Sorry, Archie,
personal expenditure.

39
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:38,620
The rules are the same
for everyone.

40
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:42,391
I suppose, technically. I thought
since you're staying here now,

41
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:44,526
<i>there might be room
for a bit of give and take.</i>

42
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:46,996
You scratch my back, I'll
scratch yours sort of thing.

43
00:02:46,997 --> 00:02:48,597
Except I don't
have an itch.

44
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:53,202
Right.

45
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,638
( bangs )

46
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,141
Ahem- is my tie
straight?

47
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:01,210
Who am I,
your mother?

48
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:04,714
Sorry.
You look fine.

49
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:09,251
Did Archie tell you who we saw
in the village this morning?

50
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:11,553
Are you joking?
Why would he confide in me

51
00:03:11,554 --> 00:03:13,756
when wonder woman's got
her feet under the table?

52
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:16,658
I don't think Archie
likes Stella living here

53
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:18,828
<i>- any more than you do.
- Come on.</i>

54
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:21,363
She says "jump,"
and he asks, "how high?"

55
00:03:21,364 --> 00:03:23,365
( bangs )

56
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:25,901
I was looking
for the utility room.

57
00:03:25,902 --> 00:03:27,669
Best of luck.

58
00:03:29,672 --> 00:03:32,641
Duncan-?

59
00:03:32,642 --> 00:03:35,644
- The utility room?
- Where is it?

60
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:39,615
What is it?

61
00:03:39,616 --> 00:03:42,718
The place where
the washing machine lives.

62
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,020
- Why didn't you say?
- I'll show her.

63
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:47,890
- I don't mind.
- I said, I'll do it.

64
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:49,691
This way.

65
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,368
You can't be serious.
I'll use the launderette.

66
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:02,938
<i>- Hector: Lexie!
- Don't leave it too long.</i>

67
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:05,274
There's already a bad smell
around this place.

68
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,681
- Lexie! - There is no need
to get yourself into a lather.

69
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:14,549
You have other
things to wear.

70
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,285
That's hardly
the point, is it?

71
00:04:16,286 --> 00:04:18,720
While we're at it, let's do
something about your hair.

72
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:21,223
Yes?
( chuckles )

73
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:22,792
I thought you were going
to the funeral.

74
00:04:22,793 --> 00:04:26,295
I am, that's why
I asked you

75
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:28,363
to send my mourning suit
to the cleaners.

76
00:04:28,364 --> 00:04:31,100
<i>That is mourning,
as in being a mourner,</i>

77
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:34,703
<i>not morning, as in
"good morning, vicar. "</i>

78
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:37,372
Think yourself lucky.
My suit never came back.

79
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:41,043
Could I make
a wee suggestion?

80
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:44,947
Next time, sort it out
yourselves.

81
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:47,582
Do you know, I think she's
in a better mood today?

82
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,151
<i>( door slams )</i>

83
00:04:49,152 --> 00:04:51,787
- Maybe I'll just not go.
- Golly, you have to.

84
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:53,255
<i>Golly: May be easier for everybody.</i>

85
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:55,324
<i>Molly: Surely you'll want to find out</i>

86
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:57,359
what sort of young woman
she's grown into?

87
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,895
This may well be
your only chance.

88
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:02,998
I'll go and look
at my other jacket.

89
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,301
Not to worry, Archie
can lend you something.

90
00:05:05,302 --> 00:05:08,103
- Yeah, of course.
- That's settled then.

91
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:10,873
Smart as you can.

92
00:05:13,476 --> 00:05:15,377
Spying now, are we?

93
00:05:15,378 --> 00:05:18,747
Calm down, you nearly
gave me a heart attack.

94
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:20,615
No more than
you deserve,

95
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:22,617
sneaking about behind
everybody's backs.

96
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:24,619
I don't sneak
anywhere.

97
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,056
I was looking for the
makings of a sandwich.

98
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:34,063
Bread.

99
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:41,203
Cheese.

100
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:44,206
- Is that it?
- Have you not heard?

101
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:46,775
Apparently, we're
on an economy drive.

102
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:49,211
( pounds )

103
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:51,313
( bangs )

104
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,050
( loud bang )

105
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:56,752
( loud pound )

106
00:05:56,753 --> 00:05:58,320
It could have been
made for you.

107
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:01,590
I've got a black tie
here somewhere.

108
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:04,960
Here it is.

109
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:07,462
Jessica.

110
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:09,464
I'm sorry?

111
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:11,833
Her name- Jessica.

112
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:13,869
That's what you've been
wanting to ask me.

113
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,871
And no, as far
as I'm aware,

114
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:19,841
there are no other MacKenzie offspring
running around. She's the only one.

115
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:22,744
Where have you
been hiding her?

116
00:06:22,745 --> 00:06:25,547
Apart from photographs, that's the
first time I've seen her in 20 years.

117
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:28,417
- You're sure that's her?
- Oh, yes.

118
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:32,054
It's her grandfather's
funeral we're going to.

119
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:35,157
That was Alison,
her mother... in the car.

120
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:38,060
<i>- I didn't know you had been married.
- we weren't.</i>

121
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:41,096
I wanted to,
but...

122
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:44,466
Alison knew she would never
be happy as a highland wife.

123
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:47,602
"Too much world to see
out there," she said.

124
00:06:47,603 --> 00:06:49,671
Anyway, the pair of them
went off

125
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:52,074
when the child was no more
than a couple of months old.

126
00:06:52,075 --> 00:06:54,310
Is Jessica gonna know
who you are?

127
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:57,179
Only one way
to find out.

128
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,760
- Kilwillie: I'm not early, am I?
- No.

129
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:14,896
- I thought you would be ready.
- I am.

130
00:07:14,897 --> 00:07:17,666
What do you think
of the new gas guzzler?

131
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,668
It's a beauty,
Kilwillie.

132
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:22,338
<i>I'm rather fond
of her myself.</i>

133
00:07:23,406 --> 00:07:25,874
She turns quite
a few heads.

134
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,742
<i>Molly:
I'm sure she does.</i>

135
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,279
Oh, yes.

136
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,082
( laughs )
Oh, yes.

137
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,749
Do you want to drive her
to the church?

138
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,551
- Really?
- Absolutely.

139
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:38,553
You don't mind a bit
of a squeeze, Molly?

140
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:40,155
- When I can get one.
- Hector: What?

141
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:43,758
We'll meet you at the bridge.
I've suddenly got the fancy

142
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,927
to stretch
the legs a bit.

143
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:47,562
Shall we
perambulate, Hector?

144
00:07:47,563 --> 00:07:51,400
I need a word on the Q.T.
I have rather splendid news.

145
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:55,337
Well, I better put
the old bus to bed.

146
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:57,006
You can leave it.

147
00:07:57,007 --> 00:07:58,940
I want to take a proper look
round the estate.

148
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:02,277
Are you sure?
She can be temperamental.

149
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:04,579
So can I.

150
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,215
What would you say
if I told you

151
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:08,250
you had been nominated,
selected, voted on

152
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:11,520
and approved for membership
of the Highland Hundred?

153
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:14,390
- I have never heard of it.
- Because it's a secret society.

154
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:16,558
- The Highland Hundred?
- Shush!

155
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:18,960
( whispering )
The Highland Hundred

156
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:21,596
has its roots in the hellfire
club of the 18th century.

157
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:23,732
<i>Men of means and influence
getting together</i>

158
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,134
to let their hair down.

159
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:27,269
It's evolved a bit
since then,

160
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,672
but membership still has,
shall I say, certain advantages.

161
00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:32,307
What sort
of advantages?

162
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:35,377
I don't just mean making the
right contacts. I promise you,

163
00:08:35,378 --> 00:08:37,846
once you've attended one
of their monthly benefits,

164
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:39,381
<i>you'll never miss
another.</i>

165
00:08:39,382 --> 00:08:43,385
I am talking a luncheon
of epicurean proportions.

166
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:45,754
<i>Gourmet food,
fine wines,</i>

167
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:48,457
<i>rare malts,
and most importantly,</i>

168
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:52,127
no fillies. So you can
always loosen the trouser belt

169
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:53,795
afterwards without fear
of reprisal.

170
00:08:53,796 --> 00:08:57,032
- Sounds like heaven on earth.
- Oh, better than that.

171
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:58,400
Why wait till now
to ask me?

172
00:08:58,401 --> 00:08:59,901
"Out of darkness
cometh light. "

173
00:08:59,902 --> 00:09:03,038
Only on the death of a member
we can bring in fresh blood.

174
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,774
I see. this chap,
do I know him?

175
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:08,110
Whose funeral do you
think we're going to?

176
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:10,479
- Aa-ah!
- Ah.

177
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:16,751
<i>- ( door opening )
- Lex?</i>

178
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:21,923
We're about to go.

179
00:09:21,924 --> 00:09:24,126
You don't have to tell
me what you're doing,

180
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:27,062
- you'll do it well.
- If you're referring to Stella,

181
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:29,164
she has our best
interests at heart.

182
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:31,233
Didn't take you long
to change sides.

183
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:35,804
- We all have a part to play.
- It's obvious what mine is. Don't worry.

184
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:39,674
I'll stay out of the way,
where I can't upset anyone.

185
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:42,478
You know how we stand. I can't
even buy nails without approval.

186
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,913
Doesn't mean you had
to ask her to move in.

187
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:48,617
If you could just see
that she gets what she needs.

188
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:51,920
( sighs )
Of course...

189
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:54,055
seeing as you
asked so nicely.

190
00:09:54,056 --> 00:09:55,924
Thank you.

191
00:10:00,997 --> 00:10:03,365
Kilwillie: You're back
in business, anyway.

192
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:07,002
It's out of my hands, take
rather a back seat these days.

193
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:09,004
Hmm. probably
for the best.

194
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:11,340
Marvelous job,
I have to say.

195
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:14,443
It should be. That's
100-year-old seasoned oak.

196
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:16,044
Whose wood have you
got for that?

197
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:18,713
Mine.
I supplied it.

198
00:10:18,714 --> 00:10:21,450
<i>- Stuart Mclntosh.
- Mclntosh?</i>

199
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:23,718
Do you realize you're
on MacDonald land?

200
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:25,654
Hector, this is
the 21st century.

201
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:27,656
The clan wars
are long over.

202
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:29,558
"MacLean Building
Materials?"

203
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,693
I had a delivery
a couple of miles away.

204
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:33,695
I thought I'd see
the finished article.

205
00:10:33,696 --> 00:10:36,331
<i>- ( car horn honking )
- Last you for generations, this will.</i>

206
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:39,000
I think that's about
to be put to the test.

207
00:10:40,336 --> 00:10:41,836
Who's this maniac?

208
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:44,072
That maniac is a loyal
family retainer.

209
00:10:44,073 --> 00:10:47,409
He's driven across this bridge more
times than you've had hot muffins.

210
00:10:51,447 --> 00:10:53,182
Watch out!

211
00:11:04,427 --> 00:11:07,729
Muscular, agile, dynamic.
24-valve, 204 bhp,

212
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,900
4.4 v8 engine, and a glovebox
big enough to hold a jamboree in.

213
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:13,768
- ( Hector chuckles )
- After you, old man.

214
00:11:15,638 --> 00:11:19,408
No wonder we lost
at Culloden.

215
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:48,604
Can I help you?

216
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:51,673
Uh, yeah. I was looking for the laird.

217
00:11:51,674 --> 00:11:53,542
You won't find him
in there.

218
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:55,777
You're probably right.

219
00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:58,413
- Let me give you a hand with those.
- It's okay.

220
00:11:58,414 --> 00:12:00,982
Come on, just so I can
boast to my pals.

221
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:02,651
What are you
talking about?

222
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:04,486
I can tell them,
truthfully,

223
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:07,222
that within a minute of
meeting the most gorgeous woman

224
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:09,924
- I had the clothes off her.
- ( giggling )

225
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:12,794
In that case,
be my guest.

226
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:16,431
When is the best time to
come back and catch the man?

227
00:12:16,432 --> 00:12:18,099
You can come in
and wait.

228
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,434
You sure?

229
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:21,803
I could do
with the company.

230
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:27,876
<i>Woman: Thank you for
coming. I appreciate it.</i>

231
00:12:31,614 --> 00:12:33,782
Hello.

232
00:12:33,783 --> 00:12:36,084
- Thank you.
- Hello, Alison.

233
00:12:37,987 --> 00:12:40,589
I was wondering when
you would say hello.

234
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:46,762
This is Golly. He's...
a very old friend of mine.

235
00:12:46,763 --> 00:12:48,430
Hi.

236
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:49,998
How are you?

237
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:52,534
Me? I'm fine.

238
00:12:52,535 --> 00:12:54,303
Good.

239
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:57,906
<i>Alison: We're here for a couple of days.</i>

240
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:00,008
All right.

241
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:02,277
We'll have to spend
some time together.

242
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:04,279
<i>Lot of catching up
to do.</i>

243
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,214
That would be
very nice.

244
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:09,884
I wanted to offer
my condolences.

245
00:13:09,885 --> 00:13:12,954
Your father will be
sorely missed.

246
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:14,489
Thank you.

247
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,838
Bit of a spook,
isn't he?

248
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,841
Just need to get
to know him.

249
00:13:32,842 --> 00:13:34,576
Hi.

250
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:37,579
That older guy that
father's glad-handing,

251
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,481
didn't he used to be
the local M.P.?

252
00:13:39,482 --> 00:13:41,450
The other one's
a sheriff.

253
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:43,819
- Gave me my first speeding fine.
- Looks the type.

254
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,855
- No news on the wake then?
- For the last time, Hector,

255
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:49,123
- they're not having one.
- It's a damned disgrace.

256
00:13:49,124 --> 00:13:51,426
Music and dancing, that's
what I want when I go.

257
00:13:51,427 --> 00:13:53,261
Believe me, dear,
there will be.

258
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:54,863
( laughing )

259
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:29,330
( gagging )
Oh, god!

260
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:31,767
Molly:
It was a lovely service.

261
00:14:31,768 --> 00:14:33,435
<i>Jessica: This town is too creepy.</i>

262
00:14:33,436 --> 00:14:36,438
We'll try
and find a hotel,

263
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:38,440
but I don't
hold out much hope.

264
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:41,510
- Mrs. MacDonald.
- Alison.

265
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:44,345
<i>Jessica: If we can't get anywhere,
I'd rather sleep in the car.</i>

266
00:14:44,346 --> 00:14:46,715
I mean it.

267
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:49,618
She's getting wobbly about
staying at her granddad's place.

268
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:51,553
No, I'm not.

269
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:54,389
There must be someone
who can put you up.

270
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,958
Any ideas, Golly?

271
00:14:58,093 --> 00:15:02,363
They'd be welcome
to stay at my cottage.

272
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:05,366
- Will you give them the west wing?
- Thank you, Duncan.

273
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,035
There's hardly room
to swing a cat.

274
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:08,570
Golly can bunk up
with us.

275
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:11,440
In that case,
that sounds ideal.

276
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:20,449
- Thanks, Duncan.
- Aye.

277
00:15:22,184 --> 00:15:24,018
No problem, Golly.

278
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:25,554
The door's open.

279
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:29,825
I'll give you
the grand tour.

280
00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:31,426
Can't wait.

281
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:40,101
Good of you
to do this.

282
00:15:40,102 --> 00:15:42,504
She is my daughter.

283
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:44,906
Wasn't sure
how you would feel

284
00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:46,975
after all this time.

285
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:49,911
Caused you a lot of pain
taking her away.

286
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:52,914
I won't deny that.

287
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:55,584
Will you tell me
something?

288
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:57,853
Was it worth it?

289
00:15:57,854 --> 00:16:01,523
You always could
read my mind.

290
00:16:01,524 --> 00:16:04,125
There were things
she's missed out on.

291
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:06,127
<i>He never said,
but I know my dad</i>

292
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:08,129
would have liked
to have seen more of her.

293
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:11,332
It's too late now.

294
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,835
<i>But it's
made me think.</i>

295
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:17,739
I realize I've given up
any right to ask for anything...

296
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,273
go on.

297
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:21,510
But I would like
to tell her the truth...

298
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:24,412
- ( sighs )
- About who you are.

299
00:16:26,348 --> 00:16:30,118
Do you think
that's for the best?

300
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:33,622
It's an opportunity
to be a part of her life.

301
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:35,624
Surely, you're not
gonna say no?

302
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,560
That's what I wanted
from the beginning.

303
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:40,962
<i>What is there
to consider?</i>

304
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:44,365
Thinking and doing
are two different animals.

305
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:48,069
Just give her
a chance to know you.

306
00:16:49,338 --> 00:16:51,272
Hmm.

307
00:16:52,808 --> 00:16:55,744
Right...
that one!

308
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:57,679
Wrong again.

309
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,814
- How do you do that?
- Magic, my dear.

310
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:01,482
- No-
- ahem-

311
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:03,418
- Arch, you're back.
- Yeah.

312
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:05,386
I'm not disturbing
anything, am I?

313
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:09,558
No. this is Stuart.
He came to see you.

314
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:12,260
The elusive laird.
It's a pleasure.

315
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:14,996
We may be able to do
some business together.

316
00:17:14,997 --> 00:17:16,531
Here.

317
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:22,270
Stuart: 12 years I've been in salvage,

318
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:24,272
I'm still surprised
what you can find

319
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:26,841
lying around
in these old estates.

320
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:29,010
Do you know
what that is?

321
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:30,712
A slate.

322
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:32,814
A ballahoolish slate.

323
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:34,616
They don't make them
like this anymore.

324
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:37,151
Look how fine
the grain is.

325
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:41,790
A derelict cottage,
what might we be talking?

326
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:45,727
Let's assume
cut stone,

327
00:17:45,728 --> 00:17:47,361
flags,

328
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:49,831
<i>lintels, lead,
timbers...</i>

329
00:17:49,832 --> 00:17:53,969
maybe a couple of nice
fireplaces- �500, 600?

330
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,971
Nah, we're wasting
each other's time.

331
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:59,207
Let's not be hasty.
�800.

332
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,642
�1200.

333
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:03,344
- I can maybe go to �900.
- How about a round �1000?

334
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:05,614
- You're on.
- Cash.

335
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:08,917
Of course. I can get a couple
of trucks here tomorrow,

336
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:11,886
- you won't even know we've been.
- That suits me fine.

337
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:14,689
You could be sitting
on a little gold mine.

338
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:18,927
- Here's to the-
- shh!

339
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:20,595
( whispering )
Highland Hundred.

340
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:26,935
Now, to business.
The benefit.

341
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:29,170
Have you had any thoughts
as to where?

342
00:18:29,171 --> 00:18:30,939
Me? why would I?

343
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,542
First time on parade, the
newest member always plays host.

344
00:18:34,543 --> 00:18:36,978
<i>- we'll hold it here.
- Here?</i>

345
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:38,713
It's a great honor.

346
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:40,615
I'm sure it is, but Archie
wouldn't stand for it.

347
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:43,018
Archie?! my dear fellow,
nobody outside the hundred

348
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:45,920
<i>must have an inkling.
Just cough up the cash,</i>

349
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:47,856
and leave the details
to those in the know.

350
00:18:47,857 --> 00:18:49,557
Right.

351
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:51,392
- Cash?
- Or check.

352
00:18:51,393 --> 00:18:53,628
How much?

353
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:55,229
- �2000.
- ( chokes )

354
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,631
It won't be a problem,
will it?

355
00:18:56,632 --> 00:18:59,534
Kilwillie-
really.

356
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:05,606
We only have
to lose the cottage,

357
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:07,475
we'd be looking
at quite a windfall.

358
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:09,610
Which "her ladyship"
need know nothing about.

359
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:12,280
No, they would be gone before
she knew they were there.

360
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:16,017
It's the ace up our sleeve
- superior knowledge of the estate.

361
00:19:16,018 --> 00:19:17,618
What will you do
with the money?

362
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:21,255
Buy us a bit of freedom. Means we
don't have to beg for every penny.

363
00:19:21,256 --> 00:19:23,257
Gets my vote.
So, where is he?

364
00:19:23,258 --> 00:19:24,959
- Who?
- Stuart.

365
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,696
Oh, he's gone.
Why?

366
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:31,099
I don't know. Just thought he
might say cheerio, that's all.

367
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,768
No, he shot
straight off.

368
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:35,937
Oh, well.

369
00:19:35,938 --> 00:19:37,672
He's a bit of a chancer, if you ask me.

370
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:41,710
Is that right? I'll let
you know after our date.

371
00:19:42,778 --> 00:19:44,378
What date?

372
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:47,548
He's requested the pleasure
of my company for dinner.

373
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:58,793
Ah!

374
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:03,431
Sorry, Hector,
the cupboard is bare.

375
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:05,700
Do put everything back
where you found it.

376
00:20:11,774 --> 00:20:13,875
<i>Golly:
Here you are.</i>

377
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:15,676
Thanks.

378
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:18,980
Mm-mmm. Best china, too. I'm honored.

379
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:20,982
I don't get a lot
of guests up here.

380
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:24,986
Don't worry, I've drunk
out of a lot worse.

381
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:27,321
Nice.

382
00:20:27,322 --> 00:20:29,758
It's been
15 years now.

383
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,026
Murray,
his name is.

384
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:33,795
He's not come up
with you?

385
00:20:33,796 --> 00:20:36,330
He thought it best
not to be here.

386
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:39,868
He's happy for us
to tell Jessica?

387
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:42,270
Jessica knows he's
her step-dad,

388
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:44,739
and he understands
why I need to do this.

389
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,308
Sounds like
a nice guy.

390
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:48,977
He is.

391
00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:50,812
What's happened
to the hot water?

392
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:54,448
- You'll have run it all off.
- But the bath's only half full.

393
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,651
- That'll be about right.
- You can manage?

394
00:20:56,652 --> 00:21:00,221
I suppose I'll have to.
Do you get electricity here,

395
00:21:00,222 --> 00:21:02,323
<i>or should we start
lighting the oil lamps?</i>

396
00:21:02,324 --> 00:21:04,358
This is
Golly's home.

397
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:07,195
Sorry.
It was a joke.

398
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:10,531
I realize that. Don't empty
the bath when you're finished.

399
00:21:10,532 --> 00:21:12,867
I've got underwear
I need to soak.

400
00:21:12,868 --> 00:21:14,368
You are kidding?

401
00:21:17,072 --> 00:21:19,274
Deserved that,
didn't I?

402
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:27,548
Thank you,
Duncan.

403
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:35,690
Do you know how many disused
cottages there are on this estate?

404
00:21:35,691 --> 00:21:38,492
What makes you
say that?

405
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:41,796
It's not a test.
Just take a guess.

406
00:21:41,797 --> 00:21:43,798
A few.

407
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:47,735
So far, I've found 10
which are rubble,

408
00:21:47,736 --> 00:21:49,403
eight half-standing,

409
00:21:49,404 --> 00:21:52,273
and 14 that,
with a bit of work,

410
00:21:52,274 --> 00:21:54,275
would make excellent
holiday homes.

411
00:21:54,276 --> 00:21:57,678
Have you counted the two
inside Wallace Woods?

412
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,480
I don't think
I did.

413
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:01,415
<i>Archie: Duncan, haven't
you something to do?</i>

414
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:04,652
<i>- I was just trying to help.
- you have. excellent, Duncan.</i>

415
00:22:07,857 --> 00:22:11,226
<i>With the shortage
of local accommodation,</i>

416
00:22:11,227 --> 00:22:12,827
there's incredible
potential.

417
00:22:12,828 --> 00:22:14,896
We have been
down that road.

418
00:22:14,897 --> 00:22:17,398
<i>Any not already renovated
aren't worth doing.</i>

419
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:19,901
I don't agree. And first
thing in the morning,

420
00:22:19,902 --> 00:22:21,302
I'm going to call
a surveyor.

421
00:22:21,303 --> 00:22:24,438
Archie, you could be
sitting on a gold mine.

422
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:26,607
Humph.

423
00:22:26,608 --> 00:22:29,143
Slight flaw
in the master plan?

424
00:22:30,913 --> 00:22:33,014
Alison: And she's eight in that one.

425
00:22:33,015 --> 00:22:35,183
<i>We were in Malta.</i>

426
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:40,922
If we're gonna do this,
it'll have to be soon.

427
00:22:40,923 --> 00:22:43,224
We can't put it off
much longer.

428
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:47,695
<i>- Who's gonna tell her?
- Jessica: tell me what?</i>

429
00:22:47,696 --> 00:22:49,931
What's going on
with you two?

430
00:22:49,932 --> 00:22:52,633
<i>You've been acting odd
all evening.</i>

431
00:22:52,634 --> 00:22:54,602
You might want
to sit down, lass.

432
00:22:54,603 --> 00:22:57,338
I'm all right
here, thanks.

433
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:00,308
Okay...

434
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,711
your mother
and me were...

435
00:23:03,712 --> 00:23:06,814
not just
old friends,

436
00:23:06,815 --> 00:23:09,317
we...

437
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:11,852
we were involved
for a while.

438
00:23:11,853 --> 00:23:15,223
- Involved?
- Whatever you want to call it.

439
00:23:15,224 --> 00:23:18,559
- I do not need to know this.
- Yes, you do.

440
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,463
- What on earth for?
- Because...

441
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:25,466
Golly is your father.

442
00:23:30,739 --> 00:23:33,274
- You?
- Yes.

443
00:23:34,443 --> 00:23:36,444
Nice timing, mum.

444
00:23:36,445 --> 00:23:38,446
<i>Thought this would
cheer me up</i>

445
00:23:38,447 --> 00:23:41,916
after granddad's
funeral, did you?

446
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:43,918
I didn't want you
to go away from here

447
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,054
thinking you've got
no connections anymore.

448
00:23:46,055 --> 00:23:48,756
One day you'll
have kids of your own,

449
00:23:48,757 --> 00:23:50,891
and they'll want to know
where their roots lie.

450
00:23:50,892 --> 00:23:52,760
You could have saved
yourself the trouble.

451
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:56,530
No wonder you've never
been able to tell me before.

452
00:23:56,531 --> 00:24:00,568
Getting yourself pregnant
by a farm laborer.

453
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,603
<i>What are you gonna
spring on me next,</i>

454
00:24:02,604 --> 00:24:04,605
<i>the village idiot
is my half-brother?</i>

455
00:24:04,606 --> 00:24:06,441
I realize I'm not
what you imagined.

456
00:24:06,442 --> 00:24:08,209
You've got that right.

457
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,211
I don't know who makes
me more embarrassed,

458
00:24:10,212 --> 00:24:12,447
you or her.

459
00:24:12,448 --> 00:24:14,382
<i>- Jessica, wait!
- ( door slams )</i>

460
00:24:56,058 --> 00:24:58,426
Why go to work
on an egg,

461
00:24:58,427 --> 00:25:00,628
when it's quicker
on a kipper?

462
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,630
- Thank you.
- Okay.

463
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:04,632
Molly.

464
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,634
For those of you
who don't know,

465
00:25:06,635 --> 00:25:08,469
I shall be dining out
this evening,

466
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,538
<i>so it'll be
a cold supper.</i>

467
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:13,107
We'll manage.
Going somewhere nice?

468
00:25:13,108 --> 00:25:17,078
<i>I'm going with
someone nice.</i>

469
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:20,648
Even better. Do I detect
romance in the air?

470
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:22,983
Mm, I could be tempted.

471
00:25:22,984 --> 00:25:24,852
<i>( door closing )</i>

472
00:25:26,721 --> 00:25:28,222
<i>Golly: hi.</i>

473
00:25:28,223 --> 00:25:31,059
I was wondering if you
could do without me

474
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,560
for the rest of the day?

475
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:34,695
I'd like to spend time
with Jessica.

476
00:25:34,696 --> 00:25:36,364
Take as much time
as you need.

477
00:25:36,365 --> 00:25:37,965
There's nothing wrong,
is there?

478
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:40,768
No, no, it's just
that I don't think

479
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:42,770
I'm what she expected
as a father.

480
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:44,905
Tell her,
if she wants to try mine...

481
00:25:44,906 --> 00:25:48,376
- thanks, Archie.
- You haven't seen Stella?

482
00:25:48,377 --> 00:25:50,178
No.

483
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:51,812
I think she
said something

484
00:25:51,813 --> 00:25:54,148
about counting
more cottages.

485
00:25:55,817 --> 00:25:57,017
Thanks, Lex.

486
00:26:00,588 --> 00:26:02,690
<i>Archie: Stella!</i>

487
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:04,692
I thought I'd see you
at breakfast.

488
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:06,627
I'll grab
something later.

489
00:26:06,628 --> 00:26:08,629
The cottages...

490
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,099
<i>I ought to warn you,
they're like</i>

491
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,766
a lot of structures
on the estate,

492
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:15,536
they look sturdy,
but one strong gust of wind

493
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:17,938
and they'll blow over.

494
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:19,273
Isn't that right,
Duncan?

495
00:26:19,274 --> 00:26:21,142
Not really.
Like I was saying,

496
00:26:21,143 --> 00:26:23,444
the ones up the long track,
they're excellent.

497
00:26:23,445 --> 00:26:26,680
<i>- It's not just the structure-
- you might as well stop there.</i>

498
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:28,782
I know why you're
so against the idea.

499
00:26:28,783 --> 00:26:31,185
- You do?
- It's the cost.

500
00:26:31,186 --> 00:26:33,954
- Eh?
- That's what's putting you off.

501
00:26:33,955 --> 00:26:36,624
One guy wanted �4000
just to supply the slates.

502
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:39,660
Exactly-
how much?

503
00:26:39,661 --> 00:26:42,997
�4000. All original, though. Reclaimed.

504
00:26:42,998 --> 00:26:44,832
�4000!

505
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:47,568
Architectural salvage
is the bandwagon to be on.

506
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:49,570
There's people making
fortunes out of it.

507
00:26:49,571 --> 00:26:51,239
Yeah, and I know
one of them.

508
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,042
So, we're dropping the
whole renovation idea?

509
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:57,945
No, we'll just buy new.
It's cheaper.

510
00:27:00,782 --> 00:27:04,084
Thank you, Duncan. I
knew I could rely on you.

511
00:27:04,085 --> 00:27:05,853
No problem.

512
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:11,759
<i>Hector: That's right. �2000.</i>

513
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,861
Well, of course,
I'm serious.

514
00:27:13,862 --> 00:27:15,696
And you can tell
whoever that is

515
00:27:15,697 --> 00:27:18,032
I can hear them laughing
in the background.

516
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:19,800
I can do what?

517
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:22,936
The same to you,
with knobs on.

518
00:27:22,937 --> 00:27:24,872
Psst! trouble?

519
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:26,507
Wrong number.
( laughs )

520
00:27:29,578 --> 00:27:31,512
What news?

521
00:27:33,315 --> 00:27:35,683
I've had a recky,

522
00:27:35,684 --> 00:27:38,519
and I think the basement
is our best bet.

523
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,021
<i>- Ahh.
- we can all assemble down there</i>

524
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:44,758
completely undetected, if you
can get the chaps in and out.

525
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:46,227
You leave that
to me.

526
00:27:48,564 --> 00:27:51,832
Your club tie. I thought I
would deliver it personally.

527
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:53,234
Jolly decent
of you.

528
00:27:53,235 --> 00:27:57,071
- Ah, check first.
- There's the rub.

529
00:27:57,072 --> 00:27:59,640
Used the last one
yesterday.

530
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:01,642
There'll be a new
checkbook in the post.

531
00:28:01,643 --> 00:28:04,812
The moment it arrives...
I'll send one on to you.

532
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:06,614
You don't have
the necessary, do you?

533
00:28:06,615 --> 00:28:08,549
( sad chuckle )

534
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:11,519
No.

535
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,854
It's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

536
00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:16,790
- It's not a problem at all.
- I can still join?

537
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:18,326
Oh, no.
I'm afraid not.

538
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:21,662
But, the benefit.
Surely you can't just cancel.

539
00:28:21,663 --> 00:28:23,464
No, we'll hold it
at my place.

540
00:28:23,465 --> 00:28:25,866
No need for the rest of us
to miss out on the jollies.

541
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:27,935
Rumor is, it's
the finest feed ever.

542
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:29,537
( chuckles )

543
00:28:40,882 --> 00:28:43,217
I thought you were
staying another night.

544
00:28:43,218 --> 00:28:45,085
I'm out of here
as soon as mum gets back.

545
00:28:45,086 --> 00:28:47,087
Well, she'll
be awhile.

546
00:28:47,088 --> 00:28:50,558
- How do you know?
- Because I asked her to.

547
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:55,396
I'm sorry about
last night.

548
00:28:55,397 --> 00:28:58,766
<i>Maybe we shouldn't have
sprung it on you like we did,</i>

549
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:02,002
but it was what
your mother wanted,

550
00:29:02,003 --> 00:29:04,004
and if I'm honest,
it's what I wanted.

551
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:05,906
A bit late to be
a part of my life.

552
00:29:05,907 --> 00:29:08,208
You know nothing
about me.

553
00:29:08,209 --> 00:29:09,877
<i>You know nothing
about me,</i>

554
00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:12,813
but I would like the
opportunity to find out.

555
00:29:12,814 --> 00:29:16,651
If you'll... if you'll give me a chance.

556
00:29:26,762 --> 00:29:28,429
Golly:
What do you think?

557
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,097
Jessica:
It's a boat.

558
00:29:30,098 --> 00:29:31,832
That's not a boat,
that's the boat.

559
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:35,035
- You don't recognize it?
- Is it...

560
00:29:35,036 --> 00:29:37,905
it's the one your grandfather
taught you to row in.

561
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:39,940
It's had a lick or two
of paint since then.

562
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:41,875
What are you
doing with it?

563
00:29:41,876 --> 00:29:44,211
He wasn't getting out
as much as he had,

564
00:29:44,212 --> 00:29:46,647
so he thought I would
have more use for it.

565
00:29:46,648 --> 00:29:49,550
Keep it
in the family, eh?

566
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:52,119
Is there anyone around who
doesn't know you're my father?

567
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:59,026
Let's get on
with this, shall we?

568
00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:02,229
Okay.

569
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,564
( door slams )

570
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:05,165
Has Stuart
been around?

571
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:06,434
No. why?

572
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:08,569
Because that shyster
has offered me a fraction

573
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,170
of what those cottages
are worth.

574
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:12,573
- He is a businessman.
- Is that what you call it?

575
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:13,907
Not that you
would know.

576
00:30:13,908 --> 00:30:15,710
I'm sorry?

577
00:30:15,711 --> 00:30:19,847
Face it. if you would have been
more capable in that direction,

578
00:30:19,848 --> 00:30:22,516
we wouldn't have you-know-who
poking her nose everywhere.

579
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:24,284
<i>Speaking of Stella,</i>

580
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:26,320
you not been up-front
with her yourself.

581
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:28,322
Morning, Archie!

582
00:30:29,524 --> 00:30:31,859
If you tell me what you
want us to take first,

583
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,193
I'll get
my boys started.

584
00:30:33,194 --> 00:30:35,195
Too late to change
my mind, then?

585
00:30:35,196 --> 00:30:37,598
- It would be awkward.
- Good. because I just have.

586
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:39,600
- We had a deal.
- So, sue me!

587
00:30:45,874 --> 00:30:47,575
Golly:
You're a natural.

588
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:50,678
Jessica: I love the water. Being in it-

589
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:53,547
being on it.
Just being next to it.

590
00:30:53,548 --> 00:30:55,850
Golly:
Yeah, me too.

591
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,821
Were you happy?

592
00:31:00,822 --> 00:31:02,923
What?

593
00:31:02,924 --> 00:31:04,825
You and mum.

594
00:31:04,826 --> 00:31:07,828
Yeah.
Well, for a while.

595
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:11,432
- Till I came along and spoiled it.
- Don't say that.

596
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:13,434
<i>That's what happened,
isn't it?</i>

597
00:31:13,435 --> 00:31:16,069
As far as I was concerned,
you made it better.

598
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:21,675
- Are you hungry?
- Oh, starving.

599
00:31:21,676 --> 00:31:25,012
Venison
or corned beef?

600
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:27,548
I'm a vegetarian.

601
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:33,053
Well, these cheese ones
will be yours.

602
00:31:33,054 --> 00:31:36,189
- Comedian, eh?
- Takes one to know one.

603
00:31:39,193 --> 00:31:41,194
Some of the cottages
are just ruins.

604
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:43,096
They're just gonna
lie there and rot.

605
00:31:43,097 --> 00:31:44,732
- His loss.
- That's Archie's trouble.

606
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:47,668
He wouldn't know a good deal if it
jumped up and bit him in the nose.

607
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:51,972
Just remember, it's thanks to his
tenacity that we're still all here.

608
00:31:51,973 --> 00:31:54,107
Not that I expect
a Mclntosh to understand.

609
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:57,778
Okay, but cash money
for a pile of rubble?

610
00:31:57,779 --> 00:31:59,413
You'd think he'd jump
at the chance.

611
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:02,149
- Cash money?
- Yep.

612
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,419
And plenty of it.

613
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,855
Tell me more.

614
00:32:09,324 --> 00:32:11,826
Golly: Must be pretty fit
to handle a boat that well.

615
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:14,829
Must be all that sport
you played at university.

616
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,465
Your grandfather and me were
the proudest men in the highlands

617
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:19,967
- the day you got your degree.
- Jessica: Really?

618
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,436
Heard you were a bit
of a footballer.

619
00:32:22,437 --> 00:32:24,505
Or have you
given that up?

620
00:32:24,506 --> 00:32:27,675
A pub near us
has got a women's team.

621
00:32:27,676 --> 00:32:30,210
- You play in it?
- I have.

622
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:32,947
Maybe I'll get
to watch you one day.

623
00:32:32,948 --> 00:32:34,748
We only play
locally.

624
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:36,450
Durham isn't
all that far.

625
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:38,686
Just give me a time
and I'll be there.

626
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:40,688
- What?
- Yeah.

627
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:43,757
Cheer you on, take you
out for a drink after.

628
00:32:43,758 --> 00:32:45,759
Maybe I can introduce you to my friends?

629
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,562
- I'd like that.
- Well, I wouldn't.

630
00:32:48,563 --> 00:32:51,899
In case you hadn't realized,
I've got someone who plays dad.

631
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,001
<i>Murray might only
be my stepfather,</i>

632
00:32:54,002 --> 00:32:55,603
but he's always
been there for me.

633
00:32:55,604 --> 00:32:57,605
<i>He was the one
who took me on holidays,</i>

634
00:32:57,606 --> 00:32:59,607
<i>helped me with my homework,
taught me to drive.</i>

635
00:32:59,608 --> 00:33:01,408
You can't step back in
and take his place.

636
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:03,410
That's not
what I meant at all.

637
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:05,546
Good, cause you're
20 years too late.

638
00:33:05,547 --> 00:33:07,915
I'm not going to apologize
for wanting to see more of you.

639
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:09,650
- I'm your father.
- No, you're not.

640
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:13,453
<i>You're a stranger.
I bet if the truth's told,</i>

641
00:33:13,454 --> 00:33:15,422
you aren't even sure
when my birthday is.

642
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,194
I knew this was
a mistake.

643
00:33:27,802 --> 00:33:31,338
So, for a whole cottage
we're talking-

644
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:34,174
well, let's assume
cut stone, flags,

645
00:33:34,175 --> 00:33:37,011
lintels, lead, timbers

646
00:33:37,012 --> 00:33:38,879
maybe a couple
of nice fireplaces-

647
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,882
- �500.
- Done.

648
00:33:41,883 --> 00:33:44,084
Let's see the color
of your money.

649
00:33:51,092 --> 00:33:54,161
<i>( door opens )</i>

650
00:34:04,272 --> 00:34:08,042
- July 24th.
- What?

651
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:11,545
Your birthday,
July 24th.

652
00:34:11,546 --> 00:34:13,513
I bought that
on your first birthday.

653
00:34:13,514 --> 00:34:16,684
Don't tell me-
you forgot to send it?

654
00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:18,786
It was sent back.

655
00:34:18,787 --> 00:34:21,221
Christmas the same year,
the same thing.

656
00:34:21,222 --> 00:34:23,557
I got this for you
when you were two.

657
00:34:23,558 --> 00:34:25,726
And this...

658
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:27,661
that Christmas, although
I admit I did not send that.

659
00:34:27,662 --> 00:34:30,497
By that time, it was too late.
I'd lost you.

660
00:34:30,498 --> 00:34:34,167
Oh, come on. You didn't
even know where we were.

661
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:35,903
I kept in touch
with your mother.

662
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,371
I knew I had obligations
and I met them.

663
00:34:38,372 --> 00:34:40,273
Just to make sure you had
what you needed.

664
00:34:40,274 --> 00:34:43,644
- Money, you mean?
- Yes, lass, money.

665
00:34:43,645 --> 00:34:46,747
Never a fortune, mind, not on
the wages of a farm laborer,

666
00:34:46,748 --> 00:34:49,349
but enough to keep
body and soul together.

667
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,920
I can't blame you
for being angry with me,

668
00:34:52,921 --> 00:34:56,590
but you at least
get your facts right.

669
00:35:02,497 --> 00:35:05,432
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

670
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:15,909
This better be good.

671
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,945
It is, Kilwillie,
it is.

672
00:35:17,946 --> 00:35:21,481
I've got it.

673
00:35:21,482 --> 00:35:23,416
Oh, Hector, I knew you
wouldn't let the side down.

674
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:26,286
It was rather
last wicket,

675
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:28,656
but a steady nerve
and a straight bat

676
00:35:28,657 --> 00:35:30,490
won the day.

677
00:35:30,491 --> 00:35:32,693
- It's all there.
- I don't doubt it.

678
00:35:32,694 --> 00:35:34,828
And this is yours.

679
00:35:34,829 --> 00:35:37,965
<i>Well, we better
alert the chaps.</i>

680
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:40,534
Benefit at Glenbogle,
tomorrow at noon.

681
00:35:40,535 --> 00:35:42,435
Marvelous.

682
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:49,810
Good job
we booked, eh?

683
00:35:49,811 --> 00:35:52,112
I should have said.

684
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:54,581
It's not the busiest night
in the local social calendar.

685
00:35:54,582 --> 00:35:56,884
So where do you
usually go to eat?

686
00:35:56,885 --> 00:35:59,086
You're joking,
aren't you?

687
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:02,056
Come on, you can't be
short on offers.

688
00:36:02,057 --> 00:36:05,125
Around here,
eligible bachelors

689
00:36:05,126 --> 00:36:07,494
are not our
greatest asset.

690
00:36:07,495 --> 00:36:09,563
I bet you've had
your moments.

691
00:36:09,564 --> 00:36:12,499
Yeah.

692
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,401
That's all
they have been.

693
00:36:15,937 --> 00:36:18,538
What about the dashing
young laird?

694
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:20,941
Me and Archie?

695
00:36:20,942 --> 00:36:22,843
( laughs )

696
00:36:22,844 --> 00:36:24,945
In your dreams.

697
00:36:24,946 --> 00:36:28,982
Cook and cleaner,
that's all he sees me as.

698
00:36:28,983 --> 00:36:32,186
Then I'd say
he needs glasses.

699
00:36:32,187 --> 00:36:35,089
Thank you, kind sir.

700
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,623
Coffee?

701
00:36:38,626 --> 00:36:40,393
As long as you
let me make it.

702
00:36:48,203 --> 00:36:50,003
- Morning.
- Hello.

703
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,175
Archie:
Sorry.

704
00:36:55,176 --> 00:36:57,745
You don't waste
much time, do you?

705
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,248
It's not for me
to say, but-

706
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:03,050
you're right.
It's not.

707
00:37:03,051 --> 00:37:06,319
- Be careful, eh?
- I am.

708
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,157
That's why we put on some
music, shared a bottle of wine,

709
00:37:10,158 --> 00:37:12,092
<i>talked into
the wee small hours,</i>

710
00:37:12,093 --> 00:37:15,929
<i>then Stuart spent the night
in one of the guest bedrooms.</i>

711
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,931
As far as I'm concerned,

712
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:20,801
he's a lot more welcome
than some people around here.

713
00:37:20,802 --> 00:37:23,904
I think she's starting
to like me.

714
00:37:23,905 --> 00:37:26,306
Are you going to be long?
I want to get started.

715
00:37:26,307 --> 00:37:28,475
Whenever
you're ready.

716
00:37:34,315 --> 00:37:36,183
Ahem, ahem-

717
00:37:37,685 --> 00:37:40,020
<i>Kilwillie:
Morning, Archie.</i>

718
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:42,289
- Morning.
- Morning.

719
00:37:43,925 --> 00:37:45,492
Ahem-

720
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:50,297
I love it when a plan comes together.

721
00:37:50,298 --> 00:37:52,766
( chuckling ) The hundred,
how are they going to get here?

722
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:54,768
To each
his own way.

723
00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:57,604
Oh-!
( laughs )

724
00:37:57,605 --> 00:38:00,207
Ahem-!

725
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:04,711
- Ah.
- Morning.

726
00:38:06,014 --> 00:38:07,948
Ahem!

727
00:38:12,954 --> 00:38:14,988
Hi.

728
00:38:17,692 --> 00:38:19,993
Look, I won't
keep you long,

729
00:38:19,994 --> 00:38:22,796
I just wanted to say
something before you go.

730
00:38:22,797 --> 00:38:27,334
Fine,
but me first.

731
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:30,204
I don't mean to sound
heartless, but I think

732
00:38:30,205 --> 00:38:32,572
we should pretend that the last
couple of days never happened.

733
00:38:35,043 --> 00:38:37,077
Okay.

734
00:38:37,078 --> 00:38:39,213
Fine.

735
00:38:39,214 --> 00:38:42,782
You're right, of course.
You've got a family.

736
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:46,987
<i>You don't need me making
things difficult for you.</i>

737
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:52,860
I spoke out of turn
yesterday, and if-

738
00:38:52,861 --> 00:38:54,761
if I've upset you,
I'm sorry.

739
00:38:54,762 --> 00:38:58,565
<i>That was the last thing
I meant to do.</i>

740
00:39:01,002 --> 00:39:02,870
There's been
enough hurt.

741
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:10,310
That's it.

742
00:39:10,311 --> 00:39:12,445
Anyway,

743
00:39:12,446 --> 00:39:14,481
you take care
of yourself, lass.

744
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:20,120
Goodbye.

745
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:47,080
<i>- Do you see that?
- Stella: what?</i>

746
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:49,149
That bush,
it moved.

747
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:54,121
It'll be
the breeze.

748
00:40:21,249 --> 00:40:23,951
<i>Stella: I had a quick
look around the other day.</i>

749
00:40:23,952 --> 00:40:27,454
It's not in too bad a condition.
It won't take much doing up.

750
00:40:27,455 --> 00:40:29,722
In a couple of months,
we could be letting.

751
00:40:37,731 --> 00:40:39,833
I don't believe it.
It's gone.

752
00:40:39,834 --> 00:40:43,203
- Must have been that breeze.
- Archie, I'm being serious.

753
00:40:43,204 --> 00:40:45,205
Are you sure this is
the right place?

754
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:47,441
Yes, well, no.
I mean-

755
00:40:47,442 --> 00:40:49,276
it can't be,
can it?

756
00:40:49,277 --> 00:40:51,044
Whole cottages
don't just vanish.

757
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:55,382
No, not without help.

758
00:40:56,985 --> 00:41:00,087
Right. now, how does the
official greeting go again?

759
00:41:00,088 --> 00:41:01,488
Just like this.

760
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:03,390
- That's it.
- That's it.

761
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:06,759
Welcome.

762
00:41:09,864 --> 00:41:11,865
Welcome, brother.

763
00:41:13,034 --> 00:41:15,935
I think it's time
to get dressed.

764
00:41:15,936 --> 00:41:17,971
Is it necessary
to do all this dressing up?

765
00:41:17,972 --> 00:41:21,508
It's not just napkins in laps and noses
in troughs. There is ceremony involved.

766
00:41:21,509 --> 00:41:24,044
Of course, ceremony.
How many more to come?

767
00:41:24,045 --> 00:41:25,712
Just one,
by my reckoning.

768
00:41:25,713 --> 00:41:27,947
( thumping above,
Molly shouting )

769
00:41:29,017 --> 00:41:31,251
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, dear.

770
00:41:34,022 --> 00:41:36,056
Thunderbirds
are go.

771
00:41:36,057 --> 00:41:37,824
Right.

772
00:41:37,825 --> 00:41:39,826
<i>Molly: Pat him down, Duncan.</i>

773
00:41:39,827 --> 00:41:42,496
And you- hands
above your head.

774
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:45,365
Spread 'em...
please.

775
00:41:45,366 --> 00:41:47,501
All right, we'll take over from here?

776
00:41:47,502 --> 00:41:51,204
- Watch out, he's tricky. - Keep him
covered, shall I, till the razzis arrive?

777
00:41:51,205 --> 00:41:54,074
I don't think there's any need
to bother the boys in blue.

778
00:41:54,075 --> 00:41:56,943
But he's an intruder.
Waltzed in, bold as you like

779
00:41:56,944 --> 00:42:00,247
and I was just settling down
to watch "Ironside. "

780
00:42:00,248 --> 00:42:02,916
Look, I think justice
could be best served

781
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:04,817
<i>if we were to take him
down to the cellar</i>

782
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:06,920
and give him
the old Kilwillie...

783
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:09,056
caution.

784
00:42:09,057 --> 00:42:11,224
What do you say,
Hector?

785
00:42:11,225 --> 00:42:13,393
( panting ) Absolutely.
it won't be a pretty sight,

786
00:42:13,394 --> 00:42:15,262
so I'm going to have
to ask you both to-

787
00:42:15,263 --> 00:42:16,996
understood.

788
00:42:18,299 --> 00:42:19,732
<i>Come on, Duncan.</i>

789
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:23,203
Sometimes its best
we don't know.

790
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:27,874
Thank you,
both of you.

791
00:42:28,943 --> 00:42:30,643
I'm so sorry,
your grace.

792
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,215
( panting )

793
00:42:45,126 --> 00:42:47,561
Come on, then.
Let's go.

794
00:42:47,562 --> 00:42:49,596
Okay.

795
00:43:24,932 --> 00:43:27,134
( coughs )

796
00:43:27,135 --> 00:43:29,802
( laughs )

797
00:43:29,803 --> 00:43:32,139
I prefer what you were
wearing last night.

798
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,374
Back to reality, eh?

799
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:36,943
Come here. You look
good to me in anything.

800
00:43:36,944 --> 00:43:38,345
Thank you.

801
00:43:38,346 --> 00:43:40,347
When were you gonna
come back and take the rest?

802
00:43:40,348 --> 00:43:42,282
What's going on?

803
00:43:42,283 --> 00:43:44,451
As far as I know

804
00:43:44,452 --> 00:43:47,120
cottages don't just disappear,
but four of ours have.

805
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:50,056
They were unsafe. Should have
been pulled down years ago.

806
00:43:50,057 --> 00:43:51,691
You don't deny
you've taken them?

807
00:43:51,692 --> 00:43:53,726
- Why should I?
- Because it's theft.

808
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:56,329
Not when you've got
a receipt.

809
00:43:58,566 --> 00:44:01,968
- That's not from me.
- Did I say it was?

810
00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:03,903
<i>Lexie: If you're looking
for someone to blame,</i>

811
00:44:03,904 --> 00:44:06,239
maybe you should look
closer to home.

812
00:44:08,842 --> 00:44:12,812
- This is it, Kilwillie.
- Certainly is. your blindfold.

813
00:44:12,813 --> 00:44:15,148
<i>- Hector: not too tight.
- Stay right where you are.</i>

814
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,585
What on earth
have you two come as?

815
00:44:18,586 --> 00:44:21,321
- Fancy dress.
- Told you there was something funny going on.

816
00:44:21,322 --> 00:44:24,724
- What an absurd suggestion.
- The money, where is it?

817
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:27,494
Say nothing.
Careless talk costs lives.

818
00:44:27,495 --> 00:44:29,362
Fear not,
Kilwillie.

819
00:44:29,363 --> 00:44:31,964
There's only one thing
for it, then.

820
00:44:31,965 --> 00:44:34,067
We'll have to take away
your toys.

821
00:44:35,536 --> 00:44:37,637
Duncan,
train set.

822
00:44:37,638 --> 00:44:39,573
It will be
mine for keeps?

823
00:44:39,574 --> 00:44:42,075
If we don't get what we want,
yes. Stella, fishing rods.

824
00:44:42,076 --> 00:44:43,677
You wouldn't dare!

825
00:44:43,678 --> 00:44:45,778
It might be the thing
to jog the memory.

826
00:44:45,779 --> 00:44:48,948
I shouldn't leave it too long.
I might forget where I put them.

827
00:44:48,949 --> 00:44:52,419
Do you know what happened to the
last woman who tried to threaten me?

828
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,655
Do you know what happened to the
last man who tried to stand in my way?

829
00:44:57,425 --> 00:44:59,392
All right.

830
00:44:59,393 --> 00:45:00,927
Duncan, wait.

831
00:45:00,928 --> 00:45:03,162
Can I just
keep an engine?

832
00:45:03,163 --> 00:45:06,065
I had the money, but it's
gone. It was only �2,000.

833
00:45:06,066 --> 00:45:09,569
- What have you done with it?
- I joined the Highland Hundred.

834
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,571
The what?

835
00:45:11,572 --> 00:45:15,342
The Highland Hundred. It's
supposed to be some secret club.

836
00:45:15,343 --> 00:45:17,110
Do you mean
you've heard of us?

837
00:45:17,111 --> 00:45:18,811
- Hasn't everybody?
- I hadn't.

838
00:45:18,812 --> 00:45:20,780
I suggest you ask
for a refund.

839
00:45:20,781 --> 00:45:23,049
<i>Kilwillie: That's completely
out of the question.</i>

840
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,985
We haven't refunded a penny
in our entire history.

841
00:45:25,986 --> 00:45:28,221
Lord Kilwillie, I intend to
recoup those funds from somewhere.

842
00:45:28,222 --> 00:45:30,089
I only wish
I could help.

843
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,525
Howard McRae, wasn't he
one of your members?

844
00:45:32,526 --> 00:45:34,193
- Oh, yes-
- ( Kilwillie stammers )

845
00:45:34,194 --> 00:45:37,631
<i>You might very well think so.
We couldn't possibly comment.</i>

846
00:45:37,632 --> 00:45:40,734
Archie: Which might explain
the people at his funeral.

847
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,035
Like the sheriff.

848
00:45:43,036 --> 00:45:45,405
I don't see what that's
got to do with anything.

849
00:45:45,406 --> 00:45:48,608
<i>I was thinking, I could tip
off the Press and Journal.</i>

850
00:45:48,609 --> 00:45:51,110
Give 'em a few names they
might be interested in printing.

851
00:45:51,111 --> 00:45:53,045
Oh, yes- it could
even pay.

852
00:45:53,046 --> 00:45:55,081
They'd want to know
who I'd heard it from.

853
00:45:55,082 --> 00:45:58,785
But then I could never hold up
my head in polite society again.

854
00:45:58,786 --> 00:46:00,320
<i>Stella:
Exactly.</i>

855
00:46:15,836 --> 00:46:18,271
Is it too late
to say I'm sorry?

856
00:46:23,277 --> 00:46:25,144
You've nothing
to be sorry for.

857
00:46:26,747 --> 00:46:29,783
Yes, I have.

858
00:46:29,784 --> 00:46:32,585
I've been thinking,

859
00:46:32,586 --> 00:46:37,089
there's no reason why I can't
have two dads, is there?

860
00:46:38,392 --> 00:46:40,527
Not that I know of.

861
00:46:40,528 --> 00:46:43,262
What changed
your mind?

862
00:46:45,766 --> 00:46:48,868
Finding out what great
taste you had in presents.

863
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:52,806
You should have seen
what I got you the year before.

864
00:46:54,508 --> 00:46:56,543
That would be nice.

865
00:46:56,544 --> 00:46:59,111
'Course, you'd have
to invite me back.

866
00:47:01,749 --> 00:47:04,083
Only if you
really mean it.

867
00:47:04,084 --> 00:47:06,820
I do.

868
00:47:08,989 --> 00:47:10,890
I promise.

869
00:47:17,197 --> 00:47:19,733
Anytime
you like, lass.

870
00:47:19,734 --> 00:47:22,935
Anytime you like.

871
00:47:30,644 --> 00:47:33,212
All's well that ends
well, eh, Kilwillie?

872
00:47:33,213 --> 00:47:37,917
It hasn't ended very well
for me or my bank balance.

873
00:47:37,918 --> 00:47:40,620
Good feed
and convivial company.

874
00:47:40,621 --> 00:47:42,622
That will take
your mind off it.

875
00:47:42,623 --> 00:47:44,924
- I suppose you're right.
- Of course I am.

876
00:47:44,925 --> 00:47:47,026
- Come on, then.
- You got me?

877
00:47:47,027 --> 00:47:49,529
- Yes.
- Thanks, old man.

878
00:47:51,699 --> 00:47:54,501
Behold,
the benefit.

879
00:47:54,502 --> 00:47:57,236
Splendid, can I take
this off now?

880
00:47:57,237 --> 00:48:01,374
No, no, I wouldn't.
Not just yet, old man.

881
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:03,976
Right, well-

882
00:48:03,977 --> 00:48:06,479
hello, chaps,
I mean, brothers.

883
00:48:08,516 --> 00:48:11,918
( chuckling )
It's lovely to be here.

884
00:48:11,919 --> 00:48:15,455
I suppose this is all
a part of the ceremony,

885
00:48:15,456 --> 00:48:17,657
you all being quiet?

886
00:48:17,658 --> 00:48:21,394
That's splendid, only
don't start without me.

887
