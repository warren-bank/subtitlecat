1
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,035
<i>Katrina: What time is the woman
from the bank getting here?</i>

2
00:00:27,036 --> 00:00:29,838
Anytime now. I've got
Duncan on guard duty.

3
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:32,674
Is that wise? First
impressions and all that.

4
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:45,520
Are you the lassie
from London?

5
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:48,791
Katrina: It'll be a relief when
I don't have to do this anymore.

6
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:52,694
I'm sick of this journey. Not to mention
the poxy job at the other end of it.

7
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:55,798
Never mind, soon we'll be running
the old homestead together.

8
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,800
That'll be great,
won't it?

9
00:00:57,801 --> 00:01:00,803
All thanks to you. You've
handled the bank brilliantly.

10
00:01:00,804 --> 00:01:03,839
Not just me. I had your
political nous behind me.

11
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:11,246
You're pulling
my leg aren't you?

12
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:13,315
I wouldn't mind.
( chuckles )

13
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,385
Sorry.
I was only joking.

14
00:01:17,386 --> 00:01:20,155
- There's no other way around?
- 15 miles by the hill.

15
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:23,292
( clears throat )

16
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:32,901
Look, she's here.

17
00:01:32,902 --> 00:01:34,736
<i>Good morning!</i>

18
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,006
<i>Katrina:
How long is she staying?</i>

19
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:39,842
Long enough to wave
the white flag

20
00:01:39,843 --> 00:01:41,944
and hand over the check
for the bridge.

21
00:01:41,945 --> 00:01:43,578
I can't wait
for that either.

22
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:45,580
<i>I've had just about
enough of this thing.</i>

23
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:48,817
- Take care.
- Duncan: Chocks away!

24
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:59,694
Hello, I'm Katrina Finlay.
Sorry we couldn't meet properly,

25
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:02,397
but I gather you're
only here for the day.

26
00:02:02,398 --> 00:02:05,334
No, I'm going to be here
for quite some time.

27
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:07,402
Unfortunately.

28
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:10,172
If this is how you greet
your customers, Mr. MacDonald,

29
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:13,308
I can see why your business
badly needs some expertise.

30
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:15,143
Welcome to Glenbogle.

31
00:02:15,144 --> 00:02:17,079
Hmmm.

32
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:21,183
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

33
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:58,620
Hector,
where are you going?

34
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:01,589
Isn't it obvious? I'm
off to practice my skiing.

35
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,159
I thought with Archie
running everything now,

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,328
and the two of us
in our twilight years,

37
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:08,463
we might spend a little
more time together.

38
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:10,432
Doing what?
Practicing crochet?

39
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:13,268
Golf! and the only way
to achieve that, I thought,

40
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:15,770
- is to join the wretched club myself.
- Molly!

41
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:19,074
So we could play together,
driving, putting, sharing a bunker.

42
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:21,143
Molly!
I've told you before.

43
00:03:21,144 --> 00:03:23,178
Golf is not a game
for the ladies.

44
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:25,380
It's a cruel,
demanding pursuit.

45
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:27,582
It requires a lifetime
of dedication,

46
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,751
and the patience
of a saint.

47
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:32,387
- A bit like being married
to you then, Hector. - Quite-

48
00:03:32,388 --> 00:03:34,689
( engine whines )

49
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,730
So Ms. Finlay is?

50
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:44,699
My girlfriend.

51
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,768
I see. Is she an employee of the estate?

52
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,304
Not yet. She's supply
teaching in Inverness.

53
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:52,374
Just a stopgap thing. Once
we get the bridge repaired,

54
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,476
we'll be running
the estate together.

55
00:03:54,477 --> 00:03:56,411
How lovely for you.

56
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:02,951
What are these?

57
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:05,020
It's transport
to the house.

58
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:06,588
( engine starts )

59
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,574
Fun isn't it?

60
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:31,079
So who was the maniac
who wrecked the bridge?

61
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,128
- ( shouts )
- ( tires squeal )

62
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:48,363
Sorry, teeing off in
10 minutes. Tally-ho.

63
00:04:48,364 --> 00:04:50,332
Father, wait!

64
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:55,870
That's my father. He's
a wonderful character.

65
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:57,805
Oh, how he
makes us laugh.

66
00:04:57,806 --> 00:04:59,674
I bet.

67
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:08,750
Ah!

68
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:10,652
You're late.

69
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:13,121
I was held up
by a troublesome harpy,

70
00:05:13,122 --> 00:05:15,057
masquerading
as my wife.

71
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:17,159
But now, thank heavens, I am safe.

72
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,693
Gracious greens,

73
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,995
softly undulating
fairways,

74
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:22,864
the reassuring hiss

75
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,167
of a state-of-the-art
sprinkler system.

76
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:28,336
Ah, yes indeed.
At least here,

77
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:30,905
a chap can find a bit
of peace and quiet.

78
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:32,774
<i>( ladies laughing )</i>

79
00:05:32,775 --> 00:05:36,878
<i>- what the- women!
- ( Kilwillie groans )</i>

80
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,781
My family have lived in this
spot since the 14th century.

81
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:41,816
Of course, there was
once a stone keep here,

82
00:05:41,817 --> 00:05:44,386
but the english soon burned
it down after Culloden.

83
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,388
Mr. MacDonald,
I have seen "Braveheart. "

84
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,356
Now let's get down
to business, shall we?

85
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:50,225
Right.

86
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:52,227
Oh, mother,

87
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:55,363
this is Stella from Lascelles.
My mother Molly.

88
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:57,732
- How nice. Stella...
- Moon.

89
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,502
Stella Moon.
What a lovely name.

90
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:02,904
I'm sorry my hands
are rather sticky.

91
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,039
I've just been milking
the sap from this tree.

92
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,112
Why exactly?

93
00:06:10,113 --> 00:06:13,215
I found this recipe for homemade
vodka. Rots the guts by all accounts.

94
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:15,783
But if it helps keep the offy
bill down to four figures-

95
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:21,289
perhaps you'd like
to wash your hands?

96
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:39,774
Just my luck.
The bore has gone.

97
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:44,112
Has he?

98
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:46,448
- ( gun cocks )
- A word of advice, lass,

99
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,916
<i>everybody lies.
It doesn't really matter</i>

100
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,385
because nobody listens.

101
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:52,587
( gun clinks )

102
00:06:54,557 --> 00:06:56,991
<i>- Lexie: fore.
- ( pans rattle )</i>

103
00:06:56,992 --> 00:06:58,893
<i>Nice one, girl.</i>

104
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,742
<i>Hector:
They're so slow.</i>

105
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:16,744
What are they doing
here anyway?

106
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:20,014
- I thought Tuesday was Ladies' Day.
- It's Thursdays too now.

107
00:07:20,015 --> 00:07:22,250
A concession of the new
president, silly chump.

108
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:24,186
What do you expect
when you elect

109
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:26,120
<i>a bally greengrocer
to the top job.</i>

110
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:29,558
- What are they doing?
- Perhaps they can't find the green.

111
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:32,227
Never have any difficulty
in locating a shop.

112
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:34,496
Ah, at last.

113
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:39,133
Can't even play the game, thus wildly
inconveniencing those those people who can.

114
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,444
What was that?

115
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:51,413
Your total indebtedness
to Lascelles

116
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:54,949
now stands
at �475,000.

117
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,185
<i>After the sadly...</i>

118
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,421
avoidable incident
at the bridge,

119
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:01,356
you applied
for a further

120
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:03,891
�100,000 loan
in order to repair it.

121
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:06,194
You calculated
that the bank

122
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,330
would eventually realize

123
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:10,765
<i>that the only way it was
going to get its cash back</i>

124
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:12,767
was by giving you more.

125
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:14,802
You were right.

126
00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:17,272
We have. the bridge
will be repaired.

127
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:20,108
That's great.
So you're here to-

128
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:23,878
hand over the check, yes.
In fact, I have it here.

129
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,281
And I'm authorized
to give it to you.

130
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:28,316
Fantastic.
Thank you very much.

131
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:30,418
- On one condition.
- Condition?

132
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,121
The bank is only prepared
to help the estate

133
00:08:33,122 --> 00:08:35,257
trade its way
out of its problems

134
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:39,261
<i>- if you take a back seat.
- What?</i>

135
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:41,863
I'm taking over.
With immediate effect.

136
00:08:54,543 --> 00:08:56,811
( whistling )

137
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:04,185
Ah!

138
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:05,820
Found it.

139
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:08,590
It went
in the stream.

140
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:10,958
No, no,
it didn't, no.

141
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,628
Match play four.
My ball, see?

142
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:15,397
Really?

143
00:09:15,398 --> 00:09:18,600
And did an obliging salmon
spit it out onto the fairway?

144
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,602
Are you accusing me
of cheating?

145
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:23,805
President: It went in the
pond. I saw it with my own eyes.

146
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:25,740
And that's
a one-stroke penalty.

147
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:28,576
And get a move on.
You're holding the ladies back.

148
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:33,114
Little Hitler, get back
to your fruit and veg.

149
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,383
What's he know
about golf?

150
00:09:35,384 --> 00:09:36,718
( choking )

151
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:39,253
( Hector laughing )
Look.

152
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:42,457
He's driven straight
into the rough.

153
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,059
And the water.

154
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,661
Oh.

155
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:53,501
Hold on a minute.
You can't do this.

156
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:56,671
I have sweated blood for this place,
given it absolutely everything.

157
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:59,341
Just like the bank. We've
given you time, opportunity,

158
00:09:59,342 --> 00:10:02,143
and not an inconsiderable sum of money.

159
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,178
And I was
making it work.

160
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:06,247
We had one piece
of bad luck.

161
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:08,883
It's not about luck.
It's about expertise.

162
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:11,118
You evidently
don't have either.

163
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:13,988
And you do? What do you know
about running a highland estate?

164
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,858
It's a failing business.
The principles are the same,

165
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:19,728
whether it's a burger shop
a bra factory or a brothel.

166
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:22,230
- Inputs and outputs.
- It's a business yes,

167
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:25,199
<i>it's also a home, a community,
and I know it better than anyone.</i>

168
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,502
I was born here.
I grew up here. it is my life.

169
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:32,707
Passion
- such a wonderful thing. In its right place.

170
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,877
- Do we have a deal?
- No, we do not. I cannot, I will not accept.

171
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:38,079
Then let me give you
some advice.

172
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,382
This isn't a game of
rugger, Mr. MacDonald.

173
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:42,884
It's a business. Why not
leave it to the experts?

174
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:45,920
Please have the books ready for
my inspection first thing tomorrow.

175
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:55,764
You're back early, Hector.
Feeling below par, are we?

176
00:10:55,765 --> 00:10:58,700
The president...
is dead.

177
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,668
Oh, dear, poor man.

178
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:02,470
Was he assassinated?

179
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:06,274
The president
of the golf club.

180
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:10,044
- Oh.
- We have to elect a successor immediately.

181
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,380
The king is dead
and all that.

182
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:16,050
I'm thinking of allowing
my name to go forward.

183
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,185
- You?
- Oh, yes.

184
00:11:18,186 --> 00:11:20,889
When the call
of destiny is heard

185
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,625
one cannot turn
a blind eye.

186
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:26,093
If you become president
of the golf club you'll never

187
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:28,663
be away from the place.
I shall never see you at all.

188
00:11:28,664 --> 00:11:31,098
There'll be responsibilities, of course.

189
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:33,200
Perks too.

190
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:36,504
That little golf buggy
for a start.

191
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:38,740
I think I'll call it-

192
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,842
the Hector mobile.

193
00:11:40,843 --> 00:11:42,944
<i>( Hector chuckles )</i>

194
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:44,612
( laughs majestically )

195
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:48,416
( rings )

196
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,418
- Hello.
- Hi, Archie, it's me.

197
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,953
Hi, sweetheart.
How are you?

198
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:54,355
Listen, I've just had
a call from Mary McBride.

199
00:11:54,356 --> 00:11:56,290
<i>- Mary who?
- you know, the M.P.</i>

200
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,093
She chaired the working party
on land reform I was on.

201
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,796
- Oh, yeah?
- She's in Inverness for the evening

202
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:04,198
and she's asked me out
to dinner. do you mind?

203
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:06,835
- No, of course not.
- How is the lady with the check?

204
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:08,837
<i>- Is she gone yet?
- yep.</i>

205
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:11,506
I mean... not exactly.

206
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:13,908
I hope you were gentle
on her, Archie.

207
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:16,110
I tried my very best.

208
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,580
- Bye.
- Bye, have fun.

209
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,385
So, stopping long
are you?

210
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:26,454
- Maybe.
- Great.

211
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:30,057
Have you got a...
boyfriend?

212
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:33,027
Duncan
- it is Duncan, isn't it?

213
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:35,663
At your service.
Any time of the day-

214
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:37,599
or night.

215
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,935
Actually, there is
something you can do for me-

216
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:42,871
<i>Duncan.</i>

217
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:46,007
Can you get me across
the zambezi some other way?

218
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:50,812
Where are you
staying, Stella?

219
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,547
Some pokey little
B & B.

220
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:55,449
The woman sounded
very strange on the phone.

221
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,718
Oh, who is it?

222
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,954
Miss Elizabeth Logan.

223
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:02,056
That's my auntie Liz.

224
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:04,091
She's smart as
a box of frogs.

225
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:19,807
( humming )

226
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:26,781
"Hector Naismith MacDonald

228
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:33,287

"get votes. "

231
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:45,800
- Dear boy.
- Ah, Kilwillie,

232
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:48,102
what a wonderful
surprise.

233
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:50,872
Come in, come in,
my dear fellow.

234
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:52,807
Can I tempt you
to a tincture?

235
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:55,877
I thought we might try this.
It's my distillery's new line.

236
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:59,781
Splendid, you're a generous
old mucker, you know that.

237
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:02,483
Oh, Hector,
I should be thanking you,

238
00:14:02,484 --> 00:14:04,986
all the help and support
you given me over the years.

239
00:14:04,987 --> 00:14:08,456
Please, don't speak of it.
What are pals for?

240
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:10,792
- Indeed.
- ( Hector laughs )

241
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:14,896
- Both: Speaking
of which- - sorry.

242
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:17,065
- No, you first.
- Please, you're my guest.

243
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:20,702
That's very kind.
It's about the presidency.

244
00:14:20,703 --> 00:14:23,437
Ah, very glad
you raised the matter.

245
00:14:23,438 --> 00:14:25,707
- It's a crucial appointment.
- Yes.

246
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,742
Especially now that
our sacred greens

247
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,777
are being invaded
by alien females.

248
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:32,279
Yes, Hector.
Yes, hole in one.

249
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,248
That's it.

250
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,784
- So-
- so...

251
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:39,854
vital that the right man
gets the job this time.

252
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:42,624
And I think we both know
who that is, don't we?

253
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,093
Well, I think we do.

254
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:47,595
- ( Hector laughs )
- Thank you, Hector.

255
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:50,665
Your support for my candidacy
will be invaluable.

256
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,233
Absolute-

257
00:14:53,702 --> 00:14:55,637
your candidacy?!

258
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:59,240
I'd rather help a rabid dog
to become president-

259
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:01,242
you haven't a hope
in hades, you know?

260
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:03,511
- Or a baboon with profound
learning difficulties.

261
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:05,179
<i>You can't even play
the bally game.</i>

262
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,548
Or... a woman!

263
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:09,483
You'd struggle
with the crazy golf

264
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:11,452
on the promenade
at Franklin-On-Sea.

265
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,387
Get off my land-

266
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:15,823
before I take a sand wedge
to your unfortunate anatomy.

267
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:17,759
You'll regret this,
Hector.

268
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,395
Just mark my perfectly
enunciated words.

269
00:15:21,396 --> 00:15:23,430
The last time I saw
a face like yours,

270
00:15:23,431 --> 00:15:26,167
- a midwife was slapping it.
- Oh, shut up!

271
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:28,136
( Hector snarls,
blows raspberry )

272
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:37,211
Arch, you've hardly
touched your dinner.

273
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:42,283
Dafty.

274
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:48,322
I'm sorry about
that Stella woman.

275
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,725
So unfeeling, yeah?

276
00:15:50,726 --> 00:15:52,459
I just wanted
to tell her to go

277
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,896
and jump in the loch,
but I couldn't.

278
00:15:54,897 --> 00:15:58,199
You could have,
in a nice Archie-type way.

279
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:02,369
Anyway, I think
she's bluffing.

280
00:16:03,438 --> 00:16:05,940
- Do you?
- Testing you out.

281
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:09,077
Seeing how determined
you are to get through it,

282
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:11,913
if you were to roll with
the first sign of pressure.

283
00:16:11,914 --> 00:16:14,548
- So if I tough it out?
- She'll back down.

284
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,818
Isn't that what Molly
and Hector think?

285
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:18,419
I haven't told them.

286
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,988
I want them to enjoy
their retirement together

287
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:22,623
quietly, without upset.

288
00:16:22,624 --> 00:16:24,926
And Katrina?

289
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:26,828
I haven't told
her either.

290
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:28,662
She's out
talking politics tonight.

291
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:31,833
Mmmm, nice for her.

292
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:38,973
You'll think over
what I said?

293
00:16:38,974 --> 00:16:41,943
Mary, I'm really flattered, but
there's nothing to think over.

294
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:44,145
You'd rather be
a laird's wife?

295
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:46,948
It's not like that.
He's not like that.

296
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:50,284
- We're not married.
- Okay, I don't know the man.

297
00:16:50,285 --> 00:16:52,586
He might be
St. Francis of Assisi.

298
00:16:52,587 --> 00:16:54,688
Or he might be
Saddam Hussein.

299
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:58,459
But consider this, what
you seem to be proposing,

300
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,962
smart, funny, talented
girl that you are,

301
00:17:00,963 --> 00:17:03,131
is not having a career
of your own.

302
00:17:03,132 --> 00:17:06,333
No, more than that, not
having a life of your own.

303
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:08,402
I need someone
like you to keep me

304
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,838
in touch with how
things really are.

305
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,706
We could be
a great team.

306
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:15,576
It'd only be the beginning
for you, believe me.

307
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,411
- But there's-
- think it over.

308
00:17:18,814 --> 00:17:21,582
And remember,
your country needs you.

309
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:30,724
<i>( Molly disguises voice ) Meet
me at the sawmill at 10:00 a. m.</i>

310
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:34,561
And you will hear something
to your advantage.

311
00:17:34,562 --> 00:17:37,665
I'll be the willowy
mysterious creature.

312
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,601
Carrying a rolled up copy

313
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:43,271
of "the Strathbogle Gazette. "

314
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:45,572
<i>( hangs up phone )</i>

315
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:56,617
<i>- Katrina: she has got to be joking.
- I don't think so.</i>

316
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:59,120
I'm going over there now
to set her straight.

317
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:02,824
Don't bother, I'll talk to her in
the morning. Anyway, it's my fight.

318
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:04,959
I mean- it's me
she wants to demote.

319
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,528
But it's so unfair
after everything you've done.

320
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:10,064
<i>And that's our plans
wrecked just like that?</i>

321
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:11,765
- No, they're not.
- Really?

322
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:14,235
How are we going to run
the place if she's in charge?

323
00:18:14,236 --> 00:18:16,770
It's never gonna happen,
as Miss Moon will discover.

324
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:19,874
She's come up here with nothing
more than a bag of hot air.

325
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,443
- And I am going to puncture it.
- You are?

326
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:24,445
Yes.

327
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:27,915
- So come here and tell me your news.
- What news?

328
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,185
You said you had some news.
Mary McBride-type news.

329
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:32,920
Oh that,

330
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:35,622
that doesn't matter.
It's not important.

331
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,220
Who is there?

332
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:11,425
Good morning,
Kilwillie.

333
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:13,527
Molly?

334
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:16,830
I expect you're wondering
why I asked you to meet me here.

335
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:18,499
<i>It had crossed my mind,</i>

336
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,102
leaving a rather tantalizing
vapor trail behind it.

337
00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:23,737
I hope I haven't dragged you
away from important business?

338
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:25,572
My dear girl,
of course not.

339
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:27,775
Even if you have,
tish and pish who cares.

340
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:30,177
- It's only this wretched-
- golf club nonsense.

341
00:19:30,178 --> 00:19:34,415
Indeed, it's a silly,
piffling business

342
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,218
compared to the global strategy

343
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,987
But do you know,
somehow I cannot get

344
00:19:39,988 --> 00:19:42,023
my rotund little head
around it.

345
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:44,392
Your presidential
election strategy-

346
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,760
<i>exactement.
That's the thing.</i>

347
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:49,130
And a very ticklish
thing it is.

348
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:51,432
Perhaps you need...

349
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:53,534
a presidential election
strategist.

350
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:58,005
I suppose I do. But where on
earth am I to find such a person?

351
00:19:58,006 --> 00:20:01,309
I don't imagine they grow on
trees, especially in Glenbogle.

352
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,212
I don't know, Kilwillie. Sometimes you
find things where you least expect them.

353
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:10,184
You don't mean-
no, you wouldn't.

354
00:20:10,185 --> 00:20:11,618
( giggles )

355
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:14,255
You'd never work against
Hector's interests, would you?

356
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:17,458
Oh, my dear man,
whatever gave you that idea?

357
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,362
It's just that
living here, golly,

358
00:20:21,363 --> 00:20:22,863
one remains an innocent,

359
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:26,968
unversed in politics

360
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:29,170
and the sordid
realities of the world.

361
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:31,339
Whereas?

362
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,240
Whereas, you golly,

363
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:35,176
are a veritable
thug in tweeds.

364
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:37,478
Thank you very much, Hector.
I love you too.

365
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:39,947
What I mean is,
you have-

366
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,249
a chilling flair
for when and where

367
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,985
to stick the dirk in.

368
00:20:43,986 --> 00:20:46,620
And this time,
Kilwillie's the hit, right?

369
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,856
Indeed.
Send him to sleep

370
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:50,724
with the fishes,
golly.

371
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:54,128
- Electorally speaking, of course.
- Okay, boss.

372
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,263
- Excellent.
- Ummm...

373
00:20:56,264 --> 00:20:58,299
what do I get out of it?

374
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,867
What- what-?

375
00:21:09,077 --> 00:21:10,444
Thank you, boss.

376
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:30,564
The answer is no.

377
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:34,801
- I see.
- I simply can't see what advantage

378
00:21:34,802 --> 00:21:37,571
would be gained for this
estate or indeed the bank,

379
00:21:37,572 --> 00:21:40,041
<i>- by you taking over
from me. - Uh-huh.</i>

380
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:43,377
I'm sorry, but I think I have a
greater knowledge and experience.

381
00:21:43,378 --> 00:21:45,379
<i>I believe I am
the only person</i>

382
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,714
who can put this place
back on its feet.

383
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:49,683
Right.

384
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:52,653
With all due respect
and no offense intended.

385
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:54,188
Fine.

386
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:56,190
Then I can do
no more here.

387
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,925
For the present.

388
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:18,679
How did it go?

389
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,481
Fine.

390
00:22:20,482 --> 00:22:22,683
- Did you tell her?
- I most certainly did.

391
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:24,885
See, I knew it would work.

392
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,620
Good on you, Arch.

393
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:29,056
Lex, sometimes
a man's got to do

394
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,791
what a man's got to do.

395
00:22:32,094 --> 00:22:34,261
Now then, Duncan,

396
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:36,630
have you got any lengths
of two by two?

397
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:42,303
Don't despair, Kilwillie,
I think I can see a way.

398
00:22:42,304 --> 00:22:43,704
Molly, can you?

399
00:22:43,705 --> 00:22:45,772
The smaller the electorate,
the more susceptible

400
00:22:45,773 --> 00:22:48,476
- they are to pressure.
- I'm not sure I could-

401
00:22:48,477 --> 00:22:52,012
the Reverend Snoddy
- exceedingly fond of the sauce.

402
00:22:52,013 --> 00:22:54,548
Send him a crate
of wine.

403
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:57,784
You know McSween who
runs the hardware store?

404
00:22:57,785 --> 00:23:00,154
His wife's
the most terrible snob.

405
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:03,424
- Invite them to dinner.
- Oh, I see.

406
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,859
And the rear admiral,
you remember, he once accused

407
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,562
Hector of cheating
at canasta.

408
00:23:08,563 --> 00:23:11,265
- This is going to be fun, isn't it?
- Molly,

409
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,934
can an admiring
and deeply grateful fellow,

410
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,936
give you a kiss?

411
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:21,175
Let's go oil the wheels
of democracy first, shall we?

412
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:24,011
And then
said deeply grateful fellow

413
00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:26,514
can offer a girl
a morsel of recompense.

414
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:30,584
You see, Kilwillie's
virtually a new boy.

415
00:23:30,585 --> 00:23:32,586
I've known these lads
for years.

416
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:34,588
McCloud, Arnatt,
Old Shuggs

417
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:36,123
all of them. now I'm-

418
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,125
quietly confident
of my reputation.

419
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,060
However confident
you are, Hector,

420
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:42,196
I think you better
check these laddies out.

421
00:23:42,197 --> 00:23:43,964
Just to be
on the safe side.

422
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,767
Very well. Meanwhile, I shall
press the flesh in person.

423
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:50,171
- Where are you going?
- 19th hole, ultimately.

424
00:23:50,172 --> 00:23:52,173
Tally-ho!

425
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,410
( coins clinking )

426
00:23:56,411 --> 00:23:58,412
Lexie: This is from my holiday fund.

427
00:23:58,413 --> 00:24:00,581
I'll pay you back.
I just need some petrol money.

428
00:24:00,582 --> 00:24:02,949
All right,
that's 5.25,

429
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,018
two Irish pence,

430
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:07,254
and 250 drachmas.

431
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,860
Arch- you did get the check
off of Stella, didn't you?

432
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:17,364
The check.

433
00:24:39,588 --> 00:24:41,488
Okay, what are you doing?

434
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,725
You rejected plan A,

435
00:24:44,726 --> 00:24:48,429
this is plan B.
There is no plan C.

436
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:52,099
You can't just-
Duncan, will you stop that?

437
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,501
You'll never sell the place
with the bridge in that state.

438
00:24:54,502 --> 00:24:56,737
First, we'll declare
you bankrupt.

439
00:24:56,738 --> 00:24:59,005
Then we'll have
the bridge repaired.

440
00:24:59,006 --> 00:25:00,807
- Then sell the estate-
- yes, but-

441
00:25:00,808 --> 00:25:02,809
all very regrettable,
of course.

442
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,646
But as you rejected
our very generous offer- tough.

443
00:25:08,983 --> 00:25:10,817
Okay.

444
00:25:13,154 --> 00:25:15,922
I'm sorry,
did you say something?

445
00:25:15,923 --> 00:25:17,758
You win.

446
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,727
I'll never
sell Glenbogle.

447
00:25:23,431 --> 00:25:26,600
- Will you just tell me what happened?
- What happened?

448
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:29,035
I'll tell you what
happened. I took your advice.

449
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:31,572
- Just about the biggest mistake of my life!
- What?

450
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,607
I've no idea how
horrendous the consequences

451
00:25:33,608 --> 00:25:35,809
will be, or how I'm
going to live with them.

452
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,811
<i>But hey, that's what
you get for being</i>

453
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:39,713
stupid enough to listen
to you, Alexandra.
454
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:41,382
Archie, just listen to me!

455
00:25:41,383 --> 00:25:43,049
I was only trying-

456
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,719
Katrina wasn't here
and you seemed quite low.

457
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,054
- Look, Lexie-
- you've disappointed me.

458
00:25:48,055 --> 00:25:49,757
You really have.

459
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,225
You're an ungrateful,
unfeeling-

460
00:25:52,226 --> 00:25:53,994
ughh!

461
00:25:53,995 --> 00:25:55,629
Lexie!

462
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,668
So Mr. MacDonald,

463
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:03,170
how exactly would
you characterize

464
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:05,939
the state of industrial
relations here at Glenbogle?

465
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:11,178
Whew!

466
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:14,247
<i>Golly: I'm telling you someone
is nobbling the committee.</i>

467
00:26:14,248 --> 00:26:16,550
You see old chap,
you're a Scot,

468
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:19,353
and therefore a pessimist
of the most lugubrious kind.

469
00:26:19,354 --> 00:26:21,388
I can tell by their voices on the phone.

470
00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:23,457
- From what they said?
- What they didn't say.

471
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,326
From the- what do you
call it- the subtext.

472
00:26:25,327 --> 00:26:28,562
- Subtext?
- Look, look. What did I tell you?

473
00:26:28,563 --> 00:26:32,466
So Old Shuggs is having a
rockery laid. That's all-

474
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,668
<i>what? you're right.</i>

475
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:36,937
<i>There he is.</i>

476
00:26:36,938 --> 00:26:38,939
Brazen!

477
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,241
Old Shuggs isn't
interested in gardening.

478
00:26:41,242 --> 00:26:43,777
But Ma Shuggs is.
Alpines, especially.

479
00:26:43,778 --> 00:26:46,213
<i>See Hector, she wears
the trousers, right?</i>

480
00:26:46,214 --> 00:26:48,649
<i>So he keeps her happy
with the flowers, that way</i>

481
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,251
he gets to spend more time
with a five iron in his fist.

482
00:26:51,252 --> 00:26:53,754
- Cunning!
- Hmmm.

483
00:26:53,755 --> 00:26:55,856
<i>Too cunning
for Kilwillie though.</i>

484
00:26:55,857 --> 00:26:59,426
I think there's a superior
intelligence at work, golly.

485
00:26:59,427 --> 00:27:01,495
I'm a bit confused
by some of these

486
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:04,398
cash-flow projections.
Perhaps you can enlighten me?

487
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:07,133
I'm not sure I can.
It's Katrina's territory.

488
00:27:07,134 --> 00:27:10,170
Ah yes, the girlfriend.
Better ask her then.

489
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:12,038
You might like
to look at this.

490
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:15,776
If you can follow it.
My recovery strategy.

491
00:27:15,777 --> 00:27:18,178
The executive summary
is at the front.

492
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:24,518
Hmmm.

493
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:28,021
We need to talk about exactly
how we're going to manage this.

494
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,724
We?

495
00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:32,158
Mr. MacDonald,

496
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,895
this business is deeper
in debt than when you arrived,

497
00:27:34,896 --> 00:27:38,432
its income lower, its
infrastructure literally crumbling.

498
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:41,635
- That is unfair.
- You don't understand basic accountancy.

499
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:43,303
<i>You can't manage staff.</i>

500
00:27:43,304 --> 00:27:45,873
If you want to be helpful,
take a long holiday.

501
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:48,776
- Look- - you are the
weakest link. Goodbye.

502
00:27:48,777 --> 00:27:50,677
Between us, Katrina and I

503
00:27:50,678 --> 00:27:52,946
have all the necessary
hands-on skills.

504
00:27:52,947 --> 00:27:54,782
I hope she's got
very long arms.

505
00:27:54,783 --> 00:27:57,284
- Eh?
- She's off to Westminster.

506
00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:58,552
<i>This fax came through.</i>

507
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:00,921
I thought it was for me
from the bank.

508
00:28:00,922 --> 00:28:03,023
<i>Something to do
with a new job.</i>

509
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:07,895
I'm sorry.

510
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:10,096
<i>She didn't tell you?</i>

511
00:28:12,266 --> 00:28:14,635
Golly: According to my canvassing,

512
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:16,637
he has three votes
in the bag.

513
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:18,639
Sheer bribery,

514
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,707
been showering
the glen with largess

515
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,876
like manure
from a muckspitter.

516
00:28:22,877 --> 00:28:24,645
You've held on
to three votes yourself.

517
00:28:24,646 --> 00:28:27,748
- Good lads.
- The infirm, the insane and the insensible.

518
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:31,318
Please, still makes three!
Who has the casting vote?

519
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:33,454
One Robert McFadden.

520
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:35,221
Bobby!

521
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:36,990
Marvelous chap.
Ha!

522
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:39,793
Is he still alive?

523
00:29:05,353 --> 00:29:07,654
<i>( knife peeling )</i>

524
00:29:13,227 --> 00:29:15,161
I'm sorry.

525
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:16,663
So you should be.

526
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:20,467
Stella's right.

527
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,402
Maybe it is time
you had a new boss.

528
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:26,339
Is it that bad?

529
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,710
It's not bad.
It utterly catastrophic.

530
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:34,681
Will you do me a favor
and get everyone together?

531
00:29:34,682 --> 00:29:36,984
I don't think I can
say this more than once.

532
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,620
Look,

533
00:29:39,621 --> 00:29:41,622
don't punish yourself.

534
00:29:41,623 --> 00:29:43,690
It's only a job.

535
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:46,092
You've still got
your mates,

536
00:29:46,093 --> 00:29:47,961
and Katrina.

537
00:29:55,537 --> 00:29:58,471
- ( man snoring )
- Hector: Ouch! shhh.

538
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,515
If we can tie old Bobby up,
metaphorically speaking-

539
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:11,384
tomorrow we'll be celebrating
your inauguration.

540
00:30:11,385 --> 00:30:12,719
Exactly.

541
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:16,189
( laughs )
Bobby, wake up, old man.

542
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,059
I have something of great
import to impart to you.

543
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,627
<i>Nurse:
Can I help you?</i>

544
00:30:20,628 --> 00:30:23,129
Visitors are asked
to check in at reception.

545
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,131
<i>This is a nursing home,</i>

546
00:30:25,132 --> 00:30:28,201
not a training ground
for aging S.A.S. Operatives.

547
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:30,671
Oh.
( chuckles )

548
00:30:30,672 --> 00:30:33,040
We though we'd give
the old chap a surprise.

549
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,208
I'm Bobby's son.

550
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:38,045
No, you're not.
You're Hector MacDonald.

551
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,947
Your vehicle once
ran over my foot

552
00:30:39,948 --> 00:30:42,449
when you mounted the cab
at the Masonic Hall.

553
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,517
You were in drink.

554
00:30:44,518 --> 00:30:48,789
- Hello, golly.
- Marion.

555
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:52,192
<i>Mr. McFadden's real son
was here a short while ago.</i>

556
00:30:52,193 --> 00:30:54,461
A most charming man.

557
00:30:54,462 --> 00:30:56,730
A most generous man.

558
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:58,899
He made a substantial
donation

559
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,901
<i>to the staff's
Christmas fund.</i>

560
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,603
Donation?

561
00:31:02,604 --> 00:31:05,305
I have the whiff of rodent
in my nostrils, golly.

562
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:08,174
His wife was charming too,
the acme of elegance.

563
00:31:08,175 --> 00:31:10,077
Kilwillie with a woman?

564
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:12,479
What was she like?

565
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,280
Perfidious woman!

566
00:31:14,281 --> 00:31:16,483
You have stabbed me
to the quick.

567
00:31:16,484 --> 00:31:18,685
Snuffed out my hopes.
Oh, treachery.

568
00:31:18,686 --> 00:31:20,988
Molly: Do be quiet,
Hector. It's a golf club

569
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:23,289
we're talking about,
not the throne of Scotland.

570
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,325
<i>Archie: Can I have some quiet, please?</i>

571
00:31:25,326 --> 00:31:28,095
I have something
to tell you all.

572
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:29,696
What is it?

573
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:35,636
- It looks like I am going to be leaving you.
- But why?

574
00:31:35,637 --> 00:31:38,038
<i>It's the only way
the bank can be stopped</i>

575
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,774
from pulling out and bringing
the whole place down.

576
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:42,509
<i>I have made my case
to Stella</i>

577
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,113
but she won't be moved and
ultimately, she has the whip hand.

578
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:48,048
This can't happen, Arch.

579
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:50,283
It's either me
or the estate.

580
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:54,154
<i>So that's it.
I am out.</i>

581
00:31:54,155 --> 00:31:56,857
Archie?
What is it?

582
00:31:59,927 --> 00:32:01,928
Archie,
I'm so sorry.

583
00:32:06,034 --> 00:32:07,600
What are you
going to do?

584
00:32:09,037 --> 00:32:10,871
I have absolutely no idea.

585
00:32:10,872 --> 00:32:14,141
Maybe I'll come
to London with you.

586
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,145
This came for you.

587
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:20,781
- I know what you're thinking.
- Congratulations.

588
00:32:20,782 --> 00:32:23,083
The job you've always
dreamed of.

589
00:32:23,084 --> 00:32:25,385
Why didn't you tell me?

590
00:32:25,386 --> 00:32:27,620
Because I had no
intention of taking it.

591
00:32:27,621 --> 00:32:29,656
That's not what
Mary McBride thinks.

592
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:32,358
"I know that you really want
to grab this opportunity

593
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:34,494
with both hands
and I can't wait to begin

594
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:36,997
what I'm sure will be
a great partnership. "

595
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,865
I thought we had
a great partnership.

596
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:40,300
Archie, will you
just shut up?

597
00:32:40,301 --> 00:32:42,535
She's trying to persuade
me to take the job.

598
00:32:42,536 --> 00:32:44,738
You need to be persuaded?

599
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:47,841
A few months ago, I would
have bitten her hand off,

600
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:49,776
but not now.

601
00:32:49,777 --> 00:32:52,079
I've got everything
I want right here.

602
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:54,915
Yeah?

603
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:59,886
Did you think I was going to
leave you and go to London?

604
00:32:59,887 --> 00:33:01,955
Especially now?

605
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:05,158
Okay.

606
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,898
So, what did she say when
you finally turned her down?

607
00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:15,035
I haven't actually
told her yet.

608
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:17,337
You're still
thinking about it?

609
00:33:17,338 --> 00:33:19,239
Yeah- well, no.

610
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,807
Archie, stop it.

611
00:33:21,943 --> 00:33:24,144
All that I have worked for
this last year,

612
00:33:24,145 --> 00:33:26,980
all that I have fought for,
have been the two things

613
00:33:26,981 --> 00:33:29,449
that I care about most:
This place and us.

614
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,684
I'm wondering now
why I bothered.

615
00:33:31,685 --> 00:33:34,687
You have no faith in
me, do you? No trust.

616
00:33:34,688 --> 00:33:37,357
First sign of trouble
and you just write me off.

617
00:33:37,358 --> 00:33:39,392
Thanks, Archie.

618
00:33:47,668 --> 00:33:49,569
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

619
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,671
<i>Lexie:
Molly?</i>

620
00:33:54,842 --> 00:33:56,977
We can't let this happen.

Duncan!

622
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,708
Dun-can!

623
00:34:34,148 --> 00:34:35,882
Whew.

624
00:34:41,522 --> 00:34:43,456
( giggles )
Get in there, girl.

625
00:34:47,895 --> 00:34:49,830
Duncan:
This is not right.

626
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:51,865
Whose side
are you on?

627
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:53,834
Don't answer that.

628
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:55,368
Lovesick bampole.

629
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,678
Dun-can!

630
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:08,281
We haven't got permission
from the escape committee.

631
00:35:08,282 --> 00:35:11,284
But I'm sure you'll enjoy a
little excursion, eh, Bobby?

632
00:35:11,285 --> 00:35:12,953
Oh dear.

633
00:35:12,954 --> 00:35:15,322
Especially in the noble cause
of democracy.

634
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:16,857
( chuckles )

635
00:35:16,858 --> 00:35:19,159
Hey!

636
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,727
Bobby:
Oh dear.

637
00:35:20,728 --> 00:35:23,429
Kilwillie: I'm sure you're
going to enjoy your day out.

638
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,765
( Bobby mumbles fearfully )

639
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:29,269
Have you ever traveled in one
of these things, Bobby?

640
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:32,005
- Rather marvelous beasts
- Bobby: Oh! oh!

641
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:34,707
<i>Kilwillie: I'm afraid it'll
put that thing of yours</i>

642
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:37,043
to shame, what?
Hector!

643
00:35:39,947 --> 00:35:42,215
Ahh!

644
00:35:51,292 --> 00:35:52,859
Hello again.

645
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,262
I've never actually
encountered a stalker before,

646
00:35:55,263 --> 00:35:57,864
<i>but on the basis
of what I've heard,</i>

647
00:35:57,865 --> 00:36:00,633
this is a pretty
weird obsession.

648
00:36:15,983 --> 00:36:17,951
Ohh,

649
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:20,086
give us a break.

650
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,159

Oh, yes.

653
00:37:02,964 --> 00:37:04,831
So?

654
00:37:04,832 --> 00:37:08,134
Lexie: You might be wondering
why we put on this pantomime.

655
00:37:08,135 --> 00:37:11,271
<i>- A bit of a laugh at my expense?
- Molly: nothing so childish.</i>

656
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:14,007
Oh here, dear.
You must be cold.

657
00:37:14,008 --> 00:37:16,977
<i>- Thank you, Molly.
- We thought we'd give you a little taste</i>

658
00:37:16,978 --> 00:37:19,579
of what it'd be like if you
carry on with this foolishness.

659
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,547
<i>Golly:
It's not just the house.</i>

660
00:37:21,548 --> 00:37:25,251
It's 39,000 acres of forest, moor,
and mountain that needs looking after.

661
00:37:25,252 --> 00:37:27,520
- You mean?
- If Archie goes...

662
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:29,622
we all go.

<i>Archie: hi.</i>

665
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:36,762
Just packing up
some stuff.

666
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:42,102
Look, I'm sorry
about last night.

667
00:37:42,103 --> 00:37:44,604
I said some things
I shouldn't have.

668
00:37:44,605 --> 00:37:47,040
I can only plead
mitigating circumstances.

669
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:50,343
But you know, rows are
sometimes good for relationships.

670
00:37:50,344 --> 00:37:53,346
You come through them a
stronger and better couple.

671
00:37:53,347 --> 00:37:56,182
- Cobblers.
- What?

672
00:37:56,183 --> 00:37:58,018
This document of hers-

673
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:00,653
the assumptions behind some
of the figures, they just seem-

674
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:04,457
is this hers?
Let's have a squint.

675
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:06,559
- Katrina, you can't.
- What's she gonna do?

676
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,495
Sue me for industrial
espionage?

677
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:14,634
Right, so if
you'll excuse me,

678
00:38:14,635 --> 00:38:17,270
I have things to do.
Before I go,

679
00:38:17,271 --> 00:38:20,373
- I've got one thing
to say to you- - yes?

680
00:38:20,374 --> 00:38:23,309
I know you.
You need to win.

681
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,678
<i>But just reflect
on this, lass,</i>

682
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,680
you can't have everything.

683
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:30,116
I mean... if you did,

684
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:32,252
where would you put it?

685
00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:36,889
<i>Molly: You must see,
dear, this stand of ours,</i>

686
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,758
anything else
wouldn't be right.

687
00:38:38,759 --> 00:38:41,661
Hector: You do the dirty on my
boy and you're history, Miss Goon.

688
00:38:41,662 --> 00:38:44,997
Moon!
You too, Duncan?

689
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:47,600
Well-

690
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,104
aye, afraid so.

691
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:53,039
You see, Stella,

692
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,475
<i>anyone who knows
anything about Archie</i>

693
00:38:55,476 --> 00:38:58,010
knows what a difference
he's made around here.

694
00:38:58,011 --> 00:38:59,679
His flair, his energies,

695
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,048
ability to get the best
out of people-

696
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,883
oh, yeah?
Fancy him, do you?

697
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:05,985
Archie: Good morning. How is life

698
00:39:05,986 --> 00:39:08,388
at the cutting edge
of management theory?

699
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,457
You just missed
the worker's revolt-

700
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:13,493
<i>- you go, they go, apparently.
- thanks, everyone, but please,</i>

701
00:39:13,494 --> 00:39:15,628
don't throw away your
futures on my account.

702
00:39:15,629 --> 00:39:17,530
I have plenty of other
irons in the fire.

703
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:20,866
Yes, it would be a shame, but
it's not the end of the world.

704
00:39:20,867 --> 00:39:23,303
<i>- they can all be replaced.
- yes, so I read-</i>

705
00:39:23,304 --> 00:39:26,139
at a cost more or less equal
to the national debt of Bolivia.

706
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,441
Get to the point,
Mr. MacDonald.

707
00:39:28,442 --> 00:39:30,543
The thing is, the coup d'etat
may have been

708
00:39:30,544 --> 00:39:32,645
a total success,
and I congratulate you,

709
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:35,648
but I do think the new regime
may not last very long,

710
00:39:35,649 --> 00:39:37,584
<i>if this is
anything to go by.</i>

711
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,222
Would you all leave Archie
and me for a moment, please?

712
00:39:42,223 --> 00:39:45,024
Katrina stays,
she's part of this.

713
00:39:53,334 --> 00:39:55,768
Okay, whatcha got?

714
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,741
Your figures are
all up the Swanee.

715
00:40:01,742 --> 00:40:04,511
<i>- No, they're not.
- not just wages, or the estimates</i>

716
00:40:04,512 --> 00:40:06,412
for supplies, food,
gift shop items,

717
00:40:06,413 --> 00:40:08,581
even loo rolls-
all way over the top.

718
00:40:08,582 --> 00:40:11,917
I can defend everything.
They're perfectly reasonable.

719
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:14,587
They would be if you made
them in an office in London,

720
00:40:14,588 --> 00:40:17,257
<i>but not for up here.
They're way too high,</i>

721
00:40:17,258 --> 00:40:20,993
which is why you've had to inflate
the income targets to match the budget.

722
00:40:20,994 --> 00:40:23,396
<i>And you'll never
meet them.</i>

723
00:40:23,397 --> 00:40:25,532
You won't last a year.
Do you want to know

724
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:27,467
- what I'd do with this?
- ( papers drop )

725
00:40:32,506 --> 00:40:34,740
So you think you
can do better, do you?

726
00:40:34,741 --> 00:40:38,378
I didn't say that. I'm sure you
have many excellent qualities.

727
00:40:38,379 --> 00:40:40,313
<i>Local knowledge
isn't one of them.</i>

728
00:40:40,314 --> 00:40:41,981
Well...

729
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:44,984
maybe there's a way of
synthesizing my approach with yours.

730
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:52,091
Last evening,
sitting after dinner,

731
00:40:52,092 --> 00:40:54,194
a glass of armagnac
at my elbow,

732
00:40:54,195 --> 00:40:56,629
musing about what I was
going to say to you lot today,

733
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:00,066
I started to think
about the relationship

734
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:03,069
between a president
and his people.

735
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,538
And I was
suddenly struck

736
00:41:05,539 --> 00:41:09,375
by the curious parallels
between my own life

737
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,777
and that of Nelson Mandela.

738
00:41:11,778 --> 00:41:15,248
We were both imprisoned
for many years

739
00:41:15,249 --> 00:41:17,217
in the struggle
for liberation.

740
00:41:17,218 --> 00:41:19,285
In my case,
from my late wife,

741
00:41:19,286 --> 00:41:21,887
- a woman of uncertain temper.
- ( door opens )

742
00:41:23,156 --> 00:41:25,692
Mr. Mandela is known
through out Africa

743
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:28,728
simply as "The Father. "

744
00:41:28,729 --> 00:41:32,665
And perhaps you could come
to think of me like that.

745
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:36,302
<i>As you sip these libations
provided at cost,</i>

746
00:41:36,303 --> 00:41:38,904
by Kilwillie Distilleries
and Ales Limited.

747
00:41:38,905 --> 00:41:41,407
Or when you enjoy
a subsidized trip

748
00:41:41,408 --> 00:41:44,544
<i>to the next
open championship,</i>

749
00:41:44,545 --> 00:41:47,280
maybe you could just
raise a glass and say-

750
00:41:47,281 --> 00:41:49,415
( snoring )

751
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:51,584
"Thank you, daddy. "

752
00:41:51,585 --> 00:41:53,686
Eh, Bobby?

753
00:41:53,687 --> 00:41:54,854
Uh?

754
00:42:03,997 --> 00:42:05,865
<i>Archie:
I'm sorry.</i>

755
00:42:07,301 --> 00:42:10,035
You'll have to put up
with me for a little bit longer.

756
00:42:10,036 --> 00:42:11,971
- ( laughing )
- What did she say?

757
00:42:11,972 --> 00:42:13,773
We'll work together.

758
00:42:13,774 --> 00:42:15,875
Under her overall
authority.

759
00:42:15,876 --> 00:42:18,645
But the bridge will be repaired
and we can get going again.

760
00:42:18,646 --> 00:42:20,713
She's in charge
and you're the underling?

761
00:42:20,714 --> 00:42:23,883
It's not gonna be easy. In fact,
it's probably gonna be a nightmare,

762
00:42:23,884 --> 00:42:25,485
but I really want
to push ahead

763
00:42:25,486 --> 00:42:27,787
with everything we've
planned and win it all back.

764
00:42:27,788 --> 00:42:30,323
I see your strategy.
Long game, secret war.

765
00:42:30,324 --> 00:42:33,693
We shall fight her on the beaches,
we shall fight her in the hills-

766
00:42:33,694 --> 00:42:36,429
- and in the kitchens.
- We shall never surrender.

767
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,299
Come on, Hector, you have
a public statement to make.

768
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,567
Hector: More fun than
running a golf club.

769
00:42:41,568 --> 00:42:44,804
<i>- You can count on me, boy.
- Duncan: Lexie?</i>

770
00:42:44,805 --> 00:42:47,173
Are we allowed to like her
as well as fight her?

771
00:42:47,174 --> 00:42:48,675
Oh, shut up.

772
00:42:48,676 --> 00:42:50,242
<i>Well done, Arch.</i>

773
00:42:58,652 --> 00:43:00,820
<i>( Kilwillie sighs )</i>

774
00:43:00,821 --> 00:43:02,288
Typical.

775
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:04,123
Can't even be bothered
to turn up.

776
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:07,293
But we do have
his address.

777
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:11,096
<i>Perhaps golly would like
to entertain us with it.</i>

778
00:43:11,097 --> 00:43:15,568
I think we just better
wait for himself.

779
00:43:15,569 --> 00:43:18,871
Come on, golly, you're not afraid
to stand on your own two feet?

780
00:43:21,408 --> 00:43:23,108
All right.

781
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:27,347
<i>( paper rustles )</i>

782
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:30,717
Right.

783
00:43:30,718 --> 00:43:33,152
"From an early age

784
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:36,823
I have been destined to
bear the burden of command.

785
00:43:36,824 --> 00:43:39,392
In the nursery,
my governess, quint,

786
00:43:39,393 --> 00:43:42,027
a sturdy female who had
worked for many years

787
00:43:42,028 --> 00:43:43,896
in a women's prison,

788
00:43:43,897 --> 00:43:48,133
instilled, by the force of
her considerable personality,

789
00:43:48,134 --> 00:43:51,003
in keen appreciation
of order and discipline. "

790
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:53,673
Ah ha,
my worthy opponent.

791
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:56,208
Sorry, I just dropped round
to say I'm pulling out.

792
00:43:56,209 --> 00:43:58,010
Yes!

793
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:00,413
Pressing estate business.
Terribly sorry.

794
00:44:00,414 --> 00:44:02,181
Best man wins
and all that.

795
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:04,717
I couldn't compete
with you, Kilwillie.

796
00:44:04,718 --> 00:44:06,486
What a generous
fellow you are.

797
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:10,490
<i>Archie: I'd never have
done it without you.</i>

798
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:13,092
<i>Katrina: Yes, you would.
Maybe in a different way.</i>

799
00:44:15,662 --> 00:44:17,597
What am I going
to do, Archie?

800
00:44:22,636 --> 00:44:25,037
You think I should
take the job, don't you?

801
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:27,440
I don't know.
Honestly, I don't.

802
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:29,742
Well, I'm not.

803
00:44:29,743 --> 00:44:31,644
I'm staying here
with you.

804
00:44:31,645 --> 00:44:33,613
Good.

805
00:44:33,614 --> 00:44:37,450
I mean you're my man.
It's just a job, right?

806
00:44:38,852 --> 00:44:41,120
Well, a career.

807
00:44:43,457 --> 00:44:45,090
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

808
00:44:47,594 --> 00:44:49,896
I'm just taking it all in.

809
00:44:49,897 --> 00:44:52,899
I know it's the kind
of job you've dreamed of.

810
00:44:54,768 --> 00:44:57,069
<i>Giving it up for me,
it makes me feel-</i>

811
00:44:58,672 --> 00:45:02,041
I don't know. it makes me
think how lucky I am.

812
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:03,576
<i>So?</i>

813
00:45:05,479 --> 00:45:07,413
I'm thinking
of the future too,

814
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:11,050
about us in a year,

815
00:45:11,051 --> 00:45:14,787
<i>you still supply teaching,
traveling to Inverness everyday.</i>

816
00:45:14,788 --> 00:45:16,656
<i>Or being Mrs. Laird-</i>


817
00:45:16,657 --> 00:45:18,558
<i>opening sports days
and church fetes.</i>

818
00:45:20,226 --> 00:45:22,929
<i>I'm wondering if you'll
still feel the same then.</i>

819
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,397
Don't say that. it sounds
like you want me to go.

820
00:45:25,398 --> 00:45:27,166
No, I don't.
Believe me, I don't.

821
00:45:29,069 --> 00:45:30,937
But you really
want that job.

822
00:45:36,477 --> 00:45:39,946
<i>- It's so unfair.
- what?</i>

823
00:45:41,982 --> 00:45:44,016
You spend your life...

824
00:45:44,017 --> 00:45:47,319
looking for the person that's
perfect for you in every way.

825
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,922
And then you find them,

826
00:45:49,923 --> 00:45:52,725
and it's wonderful
for a short time and then-

827
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:58,197
and then the world tells you
you can't have her.

828
00:46:06,707 --> 00:46:09,141
Oh, Archie,
what are we gonna do?

829
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:13,546
Do you think
it could work?

830
00:46:13,547 --> 00:46:15,748
You here and
me down there?

831
00:46:15,749 --> 00:46:20,452
You've already had one
long distance relationship.

832
00:46:20,453 --> 00:46:22,889
Yeah,
I've had that.

833
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,892
What do you think?

834
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:31,230
I feel like...

835
00:46:31,231 --> 00:46:33,666
something's
quietly dying.

836
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,774
Is that it then?

837
00:47:02,395 --> 00:47:04,830
Hector: Costly business
politics, eh, Kilwillie?

838
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:06,699
Are you sure
this is right?

839
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,535
Take it then.

840
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:11,236
( cheering )

841
00:47:11,237 --> 00:47:14,173
- Kilwillie!
- Molly.

842
00:47:14,174 --> 00:47:17,476
The girls and I congratulate
you on your great victory.

843
00:47:17,477 --> 00:47:20,646
And we so look forward
to working with you

844
00:47:20,647 --> 00:47:23,616
as you bend to the task of
delivering your solemn commitments.

845
00:47:23,617 --> 00:47:27,820
- My what?
- Ensuring that our management committee

846
00:47:27,821 --> 00:47:31,423
represents all the members
and not just the old dinosaurs,

847
00:47:31,424 --> 00:47:34,393
regardless of age
and gender.

848
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:36,395
Putting and end to such

849
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:38,864
patronizing concepts
as ladies' days.

850
00:47:38,865 --> 00:47:42,534
- I don't know if I can- - and all
the other conditions I imposed on you

851
00:47:42,535 --> 00:47:45,972
when you asked me to help you cheat,
bully and bribe your way to the top.

852
00:47:45,973 --> 00:47:49,341
But if you want to wriggle
out of them,

853
00:47:49,342 --> 00:47:51,744
I'm sure your voters
will be most interested

854
00:47:51,745 --> 00:47:54,714
to hear of your electoral
malpractices.

855
00:47:57,283 --> 00:47:59,284
Well, of course
I managed it.

856
00:47:59,285 --> 00:48:01,320
Yeah, the old trick.

857
00:48:01,321 --> 00:48:03,322
I got him to cooperate
by threatening

858
00:48:03,323 --> 00:48:05,825
with something much worse.

859
00:48:05,826 --> 00:48:08,360
Yeah, I soon got him
kicked into line.

860
00:48:08,361 --> 00:48:10,630
He's a toff. They don't
like it up them, do they?

861
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:12,297
Thank you, very much.

862
00:48:12,298 --> 00:48:13,966
Bye.

863
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:16,068
- ( rope snaps )
- Oh my god.

864
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:17,703
Oh.

865
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:21,306
Duncan!

866
00:48:21,307 --> 00:48:23,743
Dun-can!

867
00:48:23,744 --> 00:48:25,745
No, leave her be.

868
00:48:25,746 --> 00:48:28,814
That one needs to learn
the first rule of life up here.

869
00:48:28,815 --> 00:48:30,616
What's that?

870
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:32,752
Come into this world,
naked, wet and cold-

871
00:48:32,753 --> 00:48:34,887
<i>all right.</i>

872
00:48:34,888 --> 00:48:37,322
And then things
really get bad.

873
00:48:37,323 --> 00:48:39,058
<i>Duncan.</i>

874
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,831
Dun-can!

875
00:48:50,603 --> 00:48:53,305
Duncan!

876
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:55,808
