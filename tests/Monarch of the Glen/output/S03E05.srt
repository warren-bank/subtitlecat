1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,001
What do you think?

2
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:09,904
All this time I never knew
there were three Gs in Glenbogle.

3
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:13,107
- What?
- Like the three Rs in stirrer?

4
00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:16,043
Let's try to keep this
constructive, shall we?

5
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:18,880
What we're after
is blanket coverage-

6
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:21,215
which means plastering
these all over the glen.

7
00:00:21,216 --> 00:00:23,317
Invasion of the oiks,
that's what it means.

8
00:00:23,318 --> 00:00:26,421
We haven't got much time. It's
going to be hard work. Between us-

9
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:29,056
hands full,
kitchening.

10
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:32,794
I've already promised Golly
that I'd be about.

11
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:35,496
Right, it's just
us two then.

12
00:00:35,497 --> 00:00:38,633
Sorry, I've this morning's
post to sort through.

13
00:00:40,268 --> 00:00:43,838
Put it down, dear, before
you do yourself an injury.

14
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:45,640
What's all this?

15
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:47,475
Do say you like it,
Archie.

16
00:00:47,476 --> 00:00:49,844
It's our contribution
to the big day.

17
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:53,314
We thought we'd call it
"the Dungeon Experience. "

18
00:00:53,315 --> 00:00:55,983
The visitors could
come down here,

19
00:00:55,984 --> 00:00:58,920
then we could give them
a turn in the manacles,

20
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:01,656
<i>and then tell them
terrible tales</i>

21
00:01:01,657 --> 00:01:03,691
of incarceration
and despair.

22
00:01:03,692 --> 00:01:05,493
All for a modest fee,
of course.

23
00:01:05,494 --> 00:01:07,495
- Mother, it's brilliant.
- Thank you.

24
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:09,864
Of course, I can't take
all the credit.

25
00:01:09,865 --> 00:01:12,199
You father did some work.
Least he could do,

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,635
considering it was his fault
the bridge collapsed.

27
00:01:14,636 --> 00:01:17,872
- It wasn't my fault. - Hector, please.
Anyway, onwards and upwards.

28
00:01:17,873 --> 00:01:19,607
There's a lot
of research to do here

29
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:23,344
if I'm going to get this
notice board filled out in time.

30
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:25,980
Arch, try these manacles on,
they're great fun.

31
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:28,282
You don't think
you're going to find anyone

32
00:01:28,283 --> 00:01:30,751
daft enough to put
those things on, do you?

33
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,891
Ah, Duncan...

34
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:41,929
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

35
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:24,805
At least we know
they work.

36
00:02:24,806 --> 00:02:27,975
Not if we can't
unlock them, they don't.

37
00:02:27,976 --> 00:02:31,546
- It's a bit stiff, that's all.
- Careful, you'll bend it.

38
00:02:31,547 --> 00:02:34,214
All right, don't panic.
You know what we need?

39
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:36,784
- Help?
- Lubricating oil.

40
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:39,720
Stay right
where you are.

41
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:48,729
( slaps )

42
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:57,171
Ahem!

43
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:59,373
You look dazzling
this morning.

44
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:01,375
I like to make
an effort for my man.

45
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:03,010
( laughs )

46
00:03:04,713 --> 00:03:07,615
So when are you going to lift
me out of this life of drudgery?

47
00:03:07,616 --> 00:03:09,349
Maybe sooner
than you think.

48
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,151
Oh, aye?
Tell me more.

49
00:03:11,152 --> 00:03:14,154
Stick with me, cinders, I'll
make you queen of the highlands.

50
00:03:14,155 --> 00:03:16,958
After what happened to the
last one, I think I'll pass.

51
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:22,763
I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

52
00:03:22,764 --> 00:03:26,033
No, we're talking about people
getting their heads chopped off.

53
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:28,335
A tradition I'm personally
all for reviving.

54
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:30,938
Like the one about a fair
day's work for a fair day's pay?

55
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:33,340
Getting a pay raise,
am I?

56
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:36,077
I was expecting you
a quarter of an hour ago.

57
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:39,379
Whatever you wanted, it had better
be good. I've got a lot on today.

58
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,316
It's much better
than good.

59
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:44,318
After you.

60
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:00,334
Mr. MacDonald.

61
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:02,336
Oh, Councilor Ayling.

62
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:04,438
The big day
dawns, eh?

63
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:07,041
I hope you'll be along.
It should be quite an event.

64
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:08,943
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

65
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:12,179
I'm impressed.
You've done very well.

66
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,816
- Thank you. - Pass my congratulations
on to Mr. Mclntosh, too.

67
00:04:15,817 --> 00:04:18,218
He's done a great job
with that bridge.

68
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:19,754
There's more to come.

69
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:22,489
We're behind him with the
plans for the development.

70
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,558
- What development?
- Boglecroft.

71
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:28,562
- Boglecroft?
- It's got a ring to it, don't you think?

72
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:30,364
Let me get this
straight.

73
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:32,533
You want to buy
that mountain,

74
00:04:32,534 --> 00:04:35,469
Ben Bogle, and turn it into
some sort of holiday resort?

75
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,772
You got it in one.

76
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:40,374
If you want my advice,
I'd stick to what you know.

77
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,644
I'm not planning on being a
building supplier all my life.

78
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:45,312
And this...

79
00:04:45,313 --> 00:04:48,348
this just can't fail.

80
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:51,652
<i>The estate gets a lump of cash,
which I make back in timeshare,</i>

81
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:54,121
and you earn brownie points
with the bank.

82
00:04:54,122 --> 00:04:56,290
<i>Everybody's happy.</i>

83
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,495
Say I was interested, what sort
of figures are we talking about?

84
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:05,299
I could certainly
offer 200,000.

85
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,136
250,000, and we might be
in the same ballpark.

86
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:13,674
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

87
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:23,650
Looking for anything
in particular?

88
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:27,254
Oh, no, no.
I was just...

89
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:30,357
looking around.
What are these for?

90
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:32,392
Castrating
bull calves.

91
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:36,230
- What's your problem?
- No-no problem.

92
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:38,132
There is no problem.
It's just...

93
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:41,135
a mechanical hitch in the dungeon.
there's nothing to worry about.

94
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:43,904
Lubricates the parts
other oils can't reach.

95
00:05:43,905 --> 00:05:46,506
It's a little more serious
than rusty steel.

96
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:50,510
Quite frankly, what I need
is some kind of hacksaw.

97
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:52,312
Hacksaw?

98
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:54,281
There you go.

99
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:56,283
Tungsten carbide.

100
00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:58,252
Cuts like a hot knife
through butter.

101
00:05:58,253 --> 00:06:02,256
A hot knife? all right,
that's just the ticket.

102
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,461
Watch yourself.

103
00:06:09,464 --> 00:06:11,999
Molly:
Oh, sorry.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,301
- Good book, is it?
- Ripping read.

105
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:18,172
The story of Ian Mclntosh, the
dashing bird man of Glenbogle.

106
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:20,007
I think I'll wait
to see the film.

107
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:21,842
You know he was
the only man ever

108
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:23,944
to escape from our
impregnable dungeon.

109
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:26,313
- When was it?
- 1493.

110
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:29,383
Shame, I'd like to have
asked him how he did it.

111
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:32,686
This would make the perfect
tale for my notice board.

112
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:35,589
<i>The problem is,
it's a complete mystery.</i>

113
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,159
Listen- "the day
of his escape,

114
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,427
Mclntosh and a small
band of accomplices

115
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:42,963
were discovered by the
MacDonald search party,

116
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:45,800
somewhere
in the Glenbogle hills.

117
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:48,903
<i>The battle of pairc
na truit gailleach</i>

118
00:06:48,904 --> 00:06:50,537
<i>was swift and brutal.</i>

119
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:54,474
Mclntosh fought valiantly,
but he was weak from starvation

120
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:57,278
and he was cut down
on the bloody field.

121
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,381
The secret of his escape
died with him. "

122
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:03,450
Stirring stuff,
isn't it?

123
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:06,086
I prefer a good
Jackie Collins, myself.

124
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:10,590
Stuart: This is only an artist's
impression of the complex.

125
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,260
But it's pretty much
how I see Boglecroft.

126
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:16,297
And these are profit projections
for the first five years.

127
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:18,165
<i>Based on a 10% increase
in occupancy</i>

128
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,902
- over each 12-month period
- I'm impressed.

129
00:07:21,903 --> 00:07:25,072
I also have outline planning
permission from the council.

130
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:27,241
If you can deliver
on these promises...

131
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:31,545
- we might have a deal.
- Excellent.

132
00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:35,682
An historic moment: A Mclntosh
makes a killing on MacDonald land.

133
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:38,018
We can't do anything
without talking to Archie.

134
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:39,987
He can't put the kibosh
on it, can he?

135
00:07:39,988 --> 00:07:42,356
You call
the shots, right?

136
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:44,725
I have to consult with him
out of courtesy.

137
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:47,161
But while the bank's
in charge,

138
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:51,298
yes, I call the shots.

139
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:53,000
( honking )

140
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:57,071
Steady on, you nearly
ran me down.

141
00:07:57,072 --> 00:07:59,673
I know who I'd like
to run down.

142
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:06,046
What were you
planning to do?

143
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:09,616
Build some legoland for adults on
my mountain without us noticing?

144
00:08:09,617 --> 00:08:11,252
It's not as bad
as it sounds.

145
00:08:11,253 --> 00:08:13,687
You're in on this as well?
When were you gonna tell me?

146
00:08:13,688 --> 00:08:15,956
I just found out.
Hear what he's got to say.

147
00:08:15,957 --> 00:08:18,759
<i>- Go on then.
- Stuart: I'm talking a massive investment.</i>

148
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,595
- That means local jobs and wealth.
- For you, no doubt.

149
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:24,098
For everyone. People are
falling over themselves

150
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:26,867
to get out of towns
and breathe fresh air.

151
00:08:26,868 --> 00:08:29,103
What they don't want is the
inconvenience of the country,

152
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:31,939
so we give them a shop,
a swimming pool,

153
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,707
restaurants, entertainment
in the evenings.

154
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,742
<i>But we give it to them
on Ben Bogle.</i>

155
00:08:35,743 --> 00:08:37,744
That way, they get the
best of both worlds.

156
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:39,446
It's got pound signs
written all over it.

157
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:41,282
<i>It's got tacky
written all over it.</i>

158
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:43,951
It might go down well at the
Costa Del Sol, but not here.

159
00:08:43,952 --> 00:08:45,552
Well said, Archie.

160
00:08:45,553 --> 00:08:48,322
Sell a Mclntosh MacDonald
land? Over my dead body.

161
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:50,490
I'll put that
in the contract if you like.

162
00:08:50,491 --> 00:08:54,228
Think how it would boost
your visiting figures.

163
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:56,297
All those people
right on your doorstep.

164
00:08:56,298 --> 00:08:59,733
<i>- On my mountain.
- It'd be my mountain. That's the whole point.</i>

165
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:01,735
However desperate we get,
splitting up the estate

166
00:09:01,736 --> 00:09:04,338
is the one thing
I do not intend to do.

167
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:06,473
You'd pay off half
of your debt.

168
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:08,409
We could have sold land
anytime we wanted.

169
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,811
It's what I've spent
two years trying to avoid.

170
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:12,612
It's a good offer,
Archie.

171
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:14,381
One that I will fight
every step of the way.

172
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:18,118
Archie: Starting
with the council.

173
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:20,187
With me at his side.

174
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,258
( door slams )

175
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:29,629
I need a really
punchy title for my tale.

176
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,900
How about-
"the dashing bird man"?

177
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:37,104
Or, "the tartan
pimpernel"?

178
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:39,673
Yes, very good,
Lexie.

179
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:44,011
The problem is, I cannot
fathom how he escaped.

180
00:09:44,012 --> 00:09:46,913
If you're thinking about
giving up, I could use a hand.

181
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:48,949
I'll work backwards.

182
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,486
If I can figure out
where he was discovered

183
00:09:52,487 --> 00:09:57,057
<i>then, I can find out
how he escaped.</i>

184
00:09:57,058 --> 00:10:00,060
What do you think,
Lexie? hmm?

185
00:10:01,596 --> 00:10:03,297
<i>Lexie?</i>

186
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:05,366
Oh, Lexie,

187
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:07,368
you're not getting
fond of Stuart, are you?

188
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:09,336
I like him.

189
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:11,338
Think carefully
before you ally yourself

190
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,640
to a Mclntosh.
They can be a bad bit.

191
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:17,411
I'm a serf. I don't go in for alliances.

192
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:20,347
It's our relationship,
he treats me really well.

193
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:22,849
At least he doesn't think
I'm a skivvy.

194
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,219
I have never thought of you
as a skivvy.

195
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,123
Yeah, I know.
That's what I am.

196
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:31,858
That's what I always
will be, if I stay here.

197
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,172
Wouldn't you be more
comfortable in the car?

198
00:10:45,173 --> 00:10:48,142
You may be
the laird, my boy,

199
00:10:48,143 --> 00:10:50,177
but I think
you'll find

200
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:52,079
that when it comes
to dealing with officialdom,

201
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,847
the name Hector
Naismith MacDonald

202
00:10:53,848 --> 00:10:56,116
still carries
the greatest weight.

203
00:10:56,117 --> 00:10:58,152
<i>- Archie: there he is.
- Hector: yes.</i>

204
00:10:58,153 --> 00:11:00,421
Marvelous fellow, played 19
holes with him the other day.

205
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:02,289
This is going to be
easier than I thought.

206
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:05,592
Peter, dear boy.
How are you?

207
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:08,962
( chuckles )
A word in your ear.

208
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:11,365
A rather delicate matter
I'd like to discuss with you.

209
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:16,503
Ah, boys, are we
drinking to success?

210
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:19,973
- Not quite.
- Was the councilor not responsive?

211
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:21,942
He was until father
referred to him

212
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:24,911
as a "jumped-up dictator from
the wrong side of the tracks. "

213
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:27,314
Oh, dear,
was it that bad?

214
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:29,716
Worse, the council
are backing Boglecroft 100%.

215
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:31,485
- Traitors.
- Quite.

216
00:11:31,486 --> 00:11:34,388
So any official lines
of objection are blocked.

217
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,790
<i>If they weren't beforehand,
they certainly are now.</i>

218
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,159
Have you actually looked
at this plan properly,

219
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,795
or are you getting a sweat up
because it was his idea?

220
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:45,031
- It's an intrusion.
- They'll be all over us like ants.

221
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:47,201
But it's all right
when it suits you?

222
00:11:47,202 --> 00:11:49,669
You can't wait to relieve
people of their cash.

223
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,339
It's not quite
the same thing.

224
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,275
All he is guilty of is trying
to make something of himself.

225
00:11:55,276 --> 00:11:57,444
Ben Bogle is the preserve
of the MacDonalds.

226
00:11:57,445 --> 00:11:59,413
Always has been,
always will be.

227
00:11:59,414 --> 00:12:01,248
It's time the rest of us had a turn, eh?

228
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:03,850
People that weren't born with
their mouths full of silver spoons.

229
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:08,288
( door slams )

230
00:12:09,591 --> 00:12:12,226
The time has come
for direct action.

231
00:12:12,227 --> 00:12:14,428
I'm not sure
that Archie-

232
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:16,530
Golly, the boy
needs our help.

233
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:19,099
He means well, but he's got
no experience in the field.

234
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,668
This is a problem that requires
two minds and a single malt.

235
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:24,271
Sorry, Molly,
men's talk.

236
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:28,175
<i>Quite so, now, Golly,
pairc na truit gailleach.</i>

237
00:12:28,176 --> 00:12:30,577
Have you any idea
what it might mean?

238
00:12:30,578 --> 00:12:33,280
It's Gaelic for "the
Field of the Three Hags. "

239
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:36,216
- Which is where?
- It's a landmark of some kind.

240
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:38,885
<i>The three Scotch pines
on the high track.</i>

241
00:12:38,886 --> 00:12:41,588
<i>Or those caves at the
far end of the loch?</i>

242
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:43,557
Why don't you consult
family records?

243
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:47,761
Brilliant. you see, Hector,
despite what people might say,

244
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:49,596
you're not just
a pretty face.

245
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:51,331
What do you want
to know for, anyway?

246
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:53,333
Dungeon tour, I think
people are going to find

247
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:55,101
a lot more down there
than they expected.

248
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,275
- You been here all day?
- Aye.

249
00:13:01,276 --> 00:13:03,343
I thought I was gonna
be here all night.

250
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:05,445
Keep a sense of proportion,
for heaven's sake.

251
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:08,748
In the grand scheme of things
it's a tiny blip in time.

252
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:12,752
It may just be a blip in time to you,

253
00:13:12,753 --> 00:13:14,655
but my whole day
is in a guthole.

254
00:13:14,656 --> 00:13:16,690
Where are you going?

255
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:18,892
<i>Glenbogle is under threat.
We need to make plans.</i>

256
00:13:18,893 --> 00:13:23,029
Well, I'm away. I've had
nothing to eat all day.

257
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:26,366
That's desertion
in my book.

258
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:28,435
"Never in the field
of human conflict

259
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:32,306
was so much owed by so many
to so few," eh, Golly?

260
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:34,241
Absolutely, boss.

261
00:13:36,043 --> 00:13:38,312
I need you to cast an eye
over these letters.

262
00:13:38,313 --> 00:13:40,647
Don't tell me-
the Ministry of Defense

263
00:13:40,648 --> 00:13:43,383
want to compulsorily purchase
and turn us into a submarine base?

264
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:45,785
Please, we have got
to work together.

265
00:13:47,988 --> 00:13:50,390
These are requests
for patronage

266
00:13:50,391 --> 00:13:52,326
from local
organizations.

267
00:13:52,327 --> 00:13:54,328
<i>The Women's Institute
want to hold</i>

268
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,563
<i>their annual
garden party here.</i>

269
00:13:56,564 --> 00:14:00,467
Then there's the church fete,
the school sports day-

270
00:14:00,468 --> 00:14:02,936
- we help when we can.
- Yes, I know,

271
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:05,772
but the hospitality bill
would come to a couple of grand.

272
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:08,742
It's out of the question
at the moment, I'm afraid.

273
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:11,111
A "no" might be better
coming from you.

274
00:14:11,112 --> 00:14:13,313
Okay, leave them here.

275
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:25,191
We wouldn't have
this problem

276
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:27,994
if you would just
consider Stuart's offer.

277
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:31,831
Forget it.
If I give in to this

278
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:33,800
soon there'll be nothing
left to fight for.

279
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:36,236
It's only a mountain,
Archie.

280
00:14:38,306 --> 00:14:40,307
I grew up
on that mountain.

281
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:42,242
Selling it would be like
chopping an arm off.

282
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:45,579
It's an easy way
to clear half your debts.

283
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,581
And half the estate.

284
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:49,549
I know what would happen.
Next year,

285
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,518
when things are tight,
we sell little more land.

286
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,487
Then next year,
it'd be the same thing.

287
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:55,355
Would that be bad if it gets
the bank off your back?

288
00:14:55,356 --> 00:14:57,957
Where would it end, a campsite
in the vegetable garden?

289
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,460
Crazy golf around
my brother's grave?

290
00:15:00,461 --> 00:15:04,298
I will make this place pay.
But I do not intend

291
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:06,266
to turn it into a theme
park in the process.

292
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:08,935
- I thought you understood.
- I do understand.

293
00:15:08,936 --> 00:15:12,472
But Boglecroft could be a
real lifeline for this place.

294
00:15:15,443 --> 00:15:18,445
Which is why I've
recommended it to the bank.

295
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:25,285
They're all
for the idea.

296
00:15:25,286 --> 00:15:28,455
I want to make an announcement
at the grand opening,

297
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:31,191
and I'd like you
by my side.

298
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:39,299
Information is power,
knowledge is the key.

299
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,202
- Ah...?
- Surveillance, Hector.

300
00:15:42,203 --> 00:15:45,539
Keep a check on Mclntosh's moves,
then head him off at the pass.

301
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,709
Thank heavens
I've got you, Golly.

302
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:53,046
Stand by your man.

303
00:15:53,047 --> 00:15:55,649
- Who is it who said that?
- Tammy Wynette.

304
00:16:02,323 --> 00:16:04,758
What do you want?

305
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,993
A warmer welcome
would be nice.

306
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:08,895
Did we have a row
I don't know about?

307
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:11,598
You could have filled me in
- on your plans.

308
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:14,033
If I had said
something to you first,

309
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:16,035
would you
have told Archie?

310
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:19,239
No- yeah-
I don't know.

311
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,442
Exactly, I'd have put you
in an impossible situation.

312
00:16:22,443 --> 00:16:24,578
That's the last thing
I want.

313
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:28,147
I'm not gonna ask you
to choose sides, Lex.

314
00:16:28,148 --> 00:16:30,049
You might not pick me.

315
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,152
<i>And I'd rather have half
of you than nothing at all.</i>

316
00:16:33,153 --> 00:16:36,723
There is one decision
you have to make soon.

317
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:40,560
- What's that? - Where are you gonna
let me take you tomorrow evening?

318
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:44,264
- Meal or movie?
- And why not both?

319
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:46,833
Could do, but you'd have
to be very nice to me.

320
00:16:49,003 --> 00:16:51,938
I don't feel like doing
nice just now.

321
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:55,776
<i>- you don't mind, do you?
- Of course not.</i>

322
00:16:56,844 --> 00:16:58,244
( low growl )

323
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:07,687
Do you ever
take a break?

324
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:09,556
There's a lot
to get through.

325
00:17:09,557 --> 00:17:11,758
It happens I've got
a spare evening tonight.

326
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,193
You know what they say
about all work and no play.

327
00:17:14,194 --> 00:17:16,329
You could do with letting
your hair down a bit.

328
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:19,198
Is that right? Got
anything particular in mind?

329
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,167
I'm sure together we could
come up with something.

330
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:24,805
I better tell you that
my dancing days are over,

331
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:26,740
and I'm not much
of a scrabble player.

332
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:30,610
We could go for a meal,
maybe a movie,

333
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:34,213
a drink at my hotel,
relax a little-

334
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:37,818
thanks, I think I'm getting
the picture, but sorry.

335
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:39,719
I've got a date
with a VAT Return.

336
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,390
Shame. but hey, can't blame
a guy for trying.

337
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:46,827
Good night.

338
00:17:59,874 --> 00:18:01,641
The quarry
is in view, Hector.

339
00:18:01,642 --> 00:18:03,910
Set your sights
for the kill.

340
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:05,879
Hector...?

341
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:09,248
<i>Radio:
The hound is in the field.</i>

342
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:13,820
<i>Are you getting me,
Hector? Hector?</i>

343
00:18:15,055 --> 00:18:17,390
<i>Are you getting me,
Hector?</i>

344
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:20,360
Mine, I think.

345
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:22,796
We need brushes and paste. We're
gonna do some flyer posting.

346
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:25,098
Sorry, Arch, I've already
promised to help Lexie.

347
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:26,766
Okay, you can
do the pasting.

348
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:28,635
I'm your man.

349
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:32,973
<i>Golly:
Hector?</i>

350
00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:39,112
Archie MacDonald,
I'm impressed.

351
00:18:39,113 --> 00:18:42,415
We don't usually see your face
till 10:00 at the earliest.

352
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,217
I thought I'd take
a leaf out of your book.

353
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:45,585
You know what they say
about the early bird?

354
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:48,454
- Which makes me the worm?
- ( Duncan snickers )

355
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:51,758
If we could just pretend
to be adults for a second.

356
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,594
I wanted to talk to you
about the grand opening.

357
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:57,664
I thought we could do something
special to launch Boglecroft

358
00:18:57,665 --> 00:19:01,100
like a sod turning
ceremony or-

359
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:05,906
"save Ben Bogle.
Register your protest. "

360
00:19:05,907 --> 00:19:08,909
I said I'd fight you
all the way and I meant it.

361
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:33,833
You'd better
look at this.

362
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,105
Local opposition has a habit of
snowballing. I've seen it before.

363
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:42,308
Who's gonna turn up,
pensioners and sheep farmers?

364
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:45,511
<i>- we've already got the council
behind us. - The family are well-liked.</i>

365
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:50,584
Trust me, the momentum behind
Boglecroft is unstoppable.

366
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:54,721
We could sink Archie's boat
before the meeting starts.

367
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:55,655
How?

368
00:19:57,424 --> 00:19:59,358
With these.

369
00:20:00,828 --> 00:20:02,596
If everybody knew
he was withdrawing support

370
00:20:02,597 --> 00:20:04,998
from worthy causes,
how popular would he be then?

371
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:07,834
One call to the local rag
is all it would take.

372
00:20:07,835 --> 00:20:10,403
No, we do this
fair and square.

373
00:20:10,404 --> 00:20:12,872
I won't risk sullying?
Lascelles' good name.

374
00:20:12,873 --> 00:20:14,908
- It's business.
- It's underhand.

375
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:18,011
The MacDonalds wouldn't stoop
to such tactics. Neither will I.

376
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:28,187
Let me guess,
George Smiley?

377
00:20:28,188 --> 00:20:30,456
Or a geriatric
James Bond?

378
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:32,258
Actually, I was looking
for my dog Monty.

379
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:34,894
He ran off and I can't
find him anywhere. Monty?

380
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:36,930
You won't find him
through my keyhole.

381
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:38,798
<i>Golly: How are you getting on, Hector?</i>

382
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,334
<i>Any idea what that dunderhead,
Stuart is up to?</i>

383
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:44,303
If we see your wee doggie,
we'll tell him to radio in.

384
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,311
Thought you'd
go underground.

385
00:20:52,312 --> 00:20:55,314
On the contrary,
I've been on the case,

386
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:57,316
and the gloves are
very definitely off.

387
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:59,285
It's a bare-knuckle fight
Mclntosh is after.

388
00:20:59,286 --> 00:21:02,555
Absolutely. Archie's rally
is set for the knockout punch.

389
00:21:02,556 --> 00:21:04,557
The boy's in town.
I'll go and warn him.

390
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:07,627
That's what they expect.
I have a better idea.

391
00:21:07,628 --> 00:21:10,864
No wonder they reformed the
house of lords after Hector.

392
00:21:10,865 --> 00:21:13,967
He's a highland laird,
and he's my boss.

393
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:15,969
Just watch
what you say.

394
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,105
Must take years of inbreeding to
produce a brush as daft as him.

395
00:21:19,106 --> 00:21:23,242
<i>Anyway, the old goat can do what
he likes, he's not gonna stop me.</i>

396
00:21:23,243 --> 00:21:26,846
Are you referring to my
husband, Mr. Mclntosh?

397
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:30,416
How dare you denigrate him
while under his roof?

398
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:34,487
The "old goat," as you call him
has extended his hospitality.

399
00:21:34,488 --> 00:21:36,856
See that you
respect it.

400
00:21:36,857 --> 00:21:38,524
- Lexie?
- Yes.

401
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:40,326
Have you seen
the family bible?

402
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:43,262
It's in the estate office,
propping up the desk.

403
00:21:43,263 --> 00:21:45,932
Thank you, it has
our family lineage in it.

404
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:49,002
MacDonalds through the ages:
Warriors, sages, poets.

405
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:52,305
They have not been vanquished
in the past, Mr. Mclntosh.

406
00:21:52,306 --> 00:21:54,674
I believe they'll not
be vanquished today.

407
00:21:54,675 --> 00:21:56,642
Excuse me, I have
a bible to find.

408
00:21:58,245 --> 00:22:00,313
I'll just hoover up
your mess, shall I?

409
00:22:00,314 --> 00:22:03,216
Touch�
I meant to say

410
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:05,651
I can't make it later.
Don't mind, do you?

411
00:22:05,652 --> 00:22:08,588
( vacuum whines )

412
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:12,558
<i>( Hector groans )</i>

413
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,898
I'm not even
going to ask.

414
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,241
Don't tell me.

415
00:22:28,242 --> 00:22:30,309
What?

416
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,245
Colonel Mustard
with the lead piping

417
00:22:32,246 --> 00:22:34,981
in the billiard room?
What have you got here?

418
00:22:34,982 --> 00:22:37,550
The contents
of this trunk

419
00:22:37,551 --> 00:22:39,585
are of no interest
to someone

420
00:22:39,586 --> 00:22:43,156
who can't even comprehend
the word "heritage. "

421
00:22:43,157 --> 00:22:47,326
It's not- the lost treasure
of the MacDonalds, is it?

422
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:52,098
Not quite. There are one or
two family valuables in it.

423
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:54,234
I thought all
the best stuff had gone?

424
00:22:54,235 --> 00:22:57,603
The well has not
altogether dried up.

425
00:22:57,604 --> 00:23:00,106
- What are you doing
with it? - Hiding it-

426
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:03,476
( whispers )
Hiding it.

427
00:23:03,477 --> 00:23:06,312
The moment they open
this estate to the public

428
00:23:06,313 --> 00:23:08,648
there'll be all sorts
of unsavory characters

429
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:10,449
wandering
all over the place.

430
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,551
You can't move it
by yourself.

431
00:23:12,552 --> 00:23:14,921
Well, slowly, slowly,
catch a monkey.

432
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:17,924
- Here, I'll give you a hand.
- Only if you're sure.

433
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:20,994
( groaning )

434
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:24,397
Steady.
Over there.

435
00:23:26,466 --> 00:23:29,269
Whew, that's
quite a weight.

436
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,570
It's full of trinkets
and baubles,

437
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:33,239
one or two pieces.

438
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,408
Maybe I could
have a look?

439
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:38,577
- I don't think so.
- Who's to know?

440
00:23:38,578 --> 00:23:41,014
Well, true.

441
00:23:42,817 --> 00:23:44,918
There you are.

442
00:23:53,994 --> 00:23:56,696
( door creaks )

443
00:23:56,697 --> 00:23:58,597
<i>( Hector chuckles )</i>

444
00:23:58,598 --> 00:24:00,766
Candy from a baby.

445
00:24:04,738 --> 00:24:06,772
<i>Molly:
Excuse me, Stella.</i>

446
00:24:06,773 --> 00:24:08,641
Could you pass me
that ledger?

447
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:23,689
Lovely.
Expecting someone?

448
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,424
Stuart. he's late.

449
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:28,228
He's a Mclntosh.
They're quite unreliable.

450
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:30,129
<i>Stella: So I'm told
- repeatedly.</i>

451
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,332
I wonder if you
could help me.

452
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:35,902
I seem to have
mislaid my glasses

453
00:24:35,903 --> 00:24:38,938
and I need to-
here.

454
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:41,774
"Intelligence of Ian
Mclntosh's escape

455
00:24:41,775 --> 00:24:44,577
passed quickly through
the MacDonald clan,

456
00:24:44,578 --> 00:24:47,247
a search party
was raised

457
00:24:47,248 --> 00:24:49,249
and the fugitive
was soon discovered

458
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,417
sheltering
with his accomplices

459
00:24:51,418 --> 00:24:54,787
at the Field
of the Three Hags.

460
00:24:54,788 --> 00:24:58,191
Claymores were drawn,
arrows unsheathed.

461
00:24:58,192 --> 00:25:00,360
Each loyal heart
beat strongly,

462
00:25:00,361 --> 00:25:02,195
steadfast and true,

463
00:25:02,196 --> 00:25:04,264
as the MacDonalds
and the Mclntoshes

464
00:25:04,265 --> 00:25:06,499
engaged in battle. "
I'm very sorry, Molly,

465
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,534
- I'm gonna have to go.
- Oh, of course.

466
00:25:08,535 --> 00:25:11,938
I wonder would you mind,
if I borrowed this map?

467
00:25:11,939 --> 00:25:13,773
- Be my guest.
- Thank you.

468
00:25:19,746 --> 00:25:21,680
Archie:
Thank you all for coming.

469
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:25,551
Most of you you know me.
I know most of you.

470
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:28,221
You also know
why we're here.

471
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:31,024
To protest
against Boglecroft.

472
00:25:31,025 --> 00:25:35,228
That's why this petition
is so important.

473
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:37,397
Ladies and gentlemen,
I know

474
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:39,999
that I can't fight this alone,
but I think together,

475
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,269
we have a real chance
of saying no.

476
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,249
Ah, Duncan!
The very man.

477
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,284
What do you want
with me?

478
00:25:58,285 --> 00:26:00,353
I need your help,
your enthusiasm,

479
00:26:00,354 --> 00:26:02,888
your stamina, and most
of all, your brawn.

480
00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:07,026
I think I've found a way to
save Archie's bacon. Come on.

481
00:26:07,027 --> 00:26:09,028
( sighs )

482
00:26:10,597 --> 00:26:13,833
Join me in a vote
to protect our future.

483
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:16,436
Let's say no
to Boglecroft.

484
00:26:16,437 --> 00:26:18,771
( applause )

485
00:26:18,772 --> 00:26:21,441
Stella: What about the
jobs that would be created?

486
00:26:21,442 --> 00:26:24,643
As I have said,
my own five-year plan

487
00:26:24,644 --> 00:26:27,213
will give a considerable boost
to employment in the area.

488
00:26:27,214 --> 00:26:29,515
But you can't deny
that it would attract tourists

489
00:26:29,516 --> 00:26:31,550
and put money
into the local economy?

490
00:26:31,551 --> 00:26:33,686
In the short term, maybe.
But over a longer period,

491
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:35,754
it will draw wealth away
from the village.

492
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:38,224
Before long this place will
have become a ghost town.

493
00:26:38,225 --> 00:26:40,460
Mr. Mclntosh's
proposals clearly-

494
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:42,628
that's just hype
and hot air.

495
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:45,731
A personal guarantee,
can you give that on his behalf?

496
00:26:45,732 --> 00:26:48,534
- You know I can't.
- Well, I can.

497
00:26:48,535 --> 00:26:51,971
I was born here.
My ancestors are buried here.

498
00:26:51,972 --> 00:26:54,540
I am not going to cut and run.
But Mr. Mclntosh,

499
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:57,676
a man who can't even
be bothered to turn up today

500
00:26:57,677 --> 00:26:59,479
certainly won't
be here tomorrow.

501
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,881
I'm sure he must have a very good
reason for missing this meeting.

502
00:27:01,882 --> 00:27:03,883
But obviously no interest
in local opinion.

503
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:08,587
A long-term partnership
for mutual benefit,

504
00:27:08,588 --> 00:27:11,524
that's my promise.
All I am asking in return

505
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:14,427
is your signatures
on this petition.

506
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:16,262
This is abduction.

507
00:27:16,263 --> 00:27:18,564
A justifiable taking
of a prisoner, Mclntosh.

508
00:27:18,565 --> 00:27:20,799
An army without a leader
never wins.

509
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,968
Golly: The most valuable
lesson history has to teach us.

510
00:27:22,969 --> 00:27:25,604
I've not got an army.
It's only me.

511
00:27:25,605 --> 00:27:27,673
Better still.
Archie can hold his meeting

512
00:27:27,674 --> 00:27:30,743
without fear of interruption.
Did you bring the thumbscrews?

513
00:27:30,744 --> 00:27:33,579
I'd say he was more
of a rack man, myself.

514
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,581
<i>- ( door opens )
- Stuart: Lexie!</i>

515
00:27:35,582 --> 00:27:37,783
Stuart, what
are you doing?

516
00:27:37,784 --> 00:27:40,786
<i>Have you two gone
totally off your rockers?</i>

517
00:27:40,787 --> 00:27:44,723
<i>- let him out.
- It's not as easy as that.</i>

518
00:27:44,724 --> 00:27:46,392
This is.

519
00:27:46,393 --> 00:27:49,062
<i>- Hector: Stop her, Golly.
- Golly: put it down.</i>

520
00:27:51,998 --> 00:27:53,566
( yelling, commotion )

521
00:27:58,105 --> 00:27:59,439
Huh!

522
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
Ah!

523
00:28:00,441 --> 00:28:02,375
( chuckling )

524
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:04,477
Right, Hector...

525
00:28:04,478 --> 00:28:06,946
a tunnel
or wooden horse?

526
00:28:06,947 --> 00:28:08,347
<i>( Lexie, Ian laugh )</i>

527
00:28:08,348 --> 00:28:10,816
Molly:... left, I had
a good job but I left.

528
00:28:10,817 --> 00:28:13,018
Right, right...

529
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:15,788
it jolly well
serves you right.

530
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:17,856
This is rather fun,
isn't it?

531
00:28:17,857 --> 00:28:20,025
Like a treasure hunt.

532
00:28:23,497 --> 00:28:25,198
Are we
nearly there?

533
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:27,233
Well...

534
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:30,936
we come out of the woods,
to the mountain...

535
00:28:32,473 --> 00:28:36,342
oh- this isn't
on the map.

536
00:28:39,213 --> 00:28:42,315
Look, north
northeast.

537
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,221
South-southwest.

538
00:28:48,222 --> 00:28:50,823
Duncan, what would
I do without you?

539
00:28:50,824 --> 00:28:54,293
About turn-
left, left,

540
00:28:54,294 --> 00:28:56,229
<i>I had a good job
but I left.</i>

541
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,131
Thank you.

542
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:01,734
Decided to put in
an appearance then?

543
00:29:01,735 --> 00:29:03,669
I've been in a cell
for the last three hours.

544
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,771
Must be your past
catching up with you.

545
00:29:05,772 --> 00:29:09,475
I was locked up by your
father. That's right.

546
00:29:09,476 --> 00:29:11,477
The MacDonalds were
so keen to prevent me

547
00:29:11,478 --> 00:29:13,446
from telling you the truth
about their intentions

548
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:15,314
that I was held
against my will.

549
00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:18,351
No doubt, there's been a lot
of talk from the laird here

550
00:29:18,352 --> 00:29:20,553
of how much his family
have done for you in the past,

551
00:29:20,554 --> 00:29:23,356
along with the promise
of an even brighter future,

552
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:27,226
when in fact, letters
have already been signed

553
00:29:27,227 --> 00:29:30,296
refusing genuine appeals
from impoverished local causes.

554
00:29:30,297 --> 00:29:33,533
<i>All patronage
will be withdrawn,</i>

555
00:29:33,534 --> 00:29:37,770
so this man can pull up the
drawbridge and fill his own coffers.

556
00:29:37,771 --> 00:29:40,673
- This is nonsense.
- Are you denying the facts?

557
00:29:40,674 --> 00:29:42,608
- Well, no.
- Exactly.

558
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:46,345
You're pulling the wool over
the eyes of these good folk,

559
00:29:46,346 --> 00:29:48,381
people to whom you claim
to be a friend.

560
00:29:48,382 --> 00:29:50,015
I say,

561
00:29:50,016 --> 00:29:52,685
<i>throw off the shackles
of tradition and subservience.</i>

562
00:29:52,686 --> 00:29:56,489
<i>Invest in your future
with a "yes" to Boglecroft.</i>

563
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,992
There'll be jobs
and prosperity for all.

564
00:29:59,993 --> 00:30:02,461
I did not show him the letters.
He saw them on the desk.

565
00:30:02,462 --> 00:30:04,397
Where you just happen
to have left them?

566
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:06,499
Well, congratulations.

567
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,234
You came here to help
save Glenbogle

568
00:30:08,235 --> 00:30:11,170
and you signed the death warrant
for the estate and the community.

569
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:13,606
Archie, you forgot
your petition.

570
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:15,841
Three signatures.
I'm very impressed.

571
00:30:15,842 --> 00:30:17,643
<i>( chuckles )</i>

572
00:30:17,644 --> 00:30:20,346
Are you sure you know
what we're doing?

573
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:22,348
Yes, Duncan.

574
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:24,383
Anyway, I'm not
turning back.

575
00:30:24,384 --> 00:30:28,287
I don't even know what it is
we're looking for, exactly.

576
00:30:28,288 --> 00:30:31,757
The Three Hags, Duncan. They
mark an ancient battlefield,

577
00:30:31,758 --> 00:30:36,128
and also the proposed site
of Boglecroft, so I thought.

578
00:30:36,129 --> 00:30:38,598
If I could
just match the two,

579
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,700
we could scupper
Stuart's plans.

580
00:30:40,701 --> 00:30:46,004
He can't build on an
historic site, can he?

581
00:30:46,005 --> 00:30:48,774
( panting ) Let's hope Archie's
having more luck than we are.

582
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:52,278
- Nature trail 4-b.
- What?

583
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:56,282
The Field of the Three Hags.
It's on nature trail 4-b.

584
00:30:56,283 --> 00:30:58,384
That's one of my
favorite walks.

585
00:30:58,385 --> 00:31:00,486
I don't believe it.
You're a treasure!

586
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:02,355
- Take me to it.
- You're here.

587
00:31:02,356 --> 00:31:06,359
You were sitting on one of them.
These are the other two.

588
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,427
If only you'd
told me,

589
00:31:08,428 --> 00:31:11,196
I could have taken
you here in 10 minutes.

590
00:31:11,197 --> 00:31:13,566
- Stuart: Thank you.
- Man: Thank you very much.

591
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:16,636
You couldn't resist
fighting dirty, could you?

592
00:31:16,637 --> 00:31:18,738
Not if it means we get
what we want.

593
00:31:18,739 --> 00:31:21,474
Old Hector hardly played
it by the book, did he?

594
00:31:21,475 --> 00:31:23,609
It's not Hector
I'm worried about.

595
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,579
You've destroyed any trust
there was between me and Archie.

596
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,415
Look what you've gained.
Everyone's on our side now.

597
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:31,751
<i>We're a great team
with a great future.</i>

598
00:31:31,752 --> 00:31:34,920
Once people have been to Boglecroft,
they'll want to come back,

599
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:36,889
as the demand
for timeshare increases.

600
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,825
- We can build to order.
- You can only expand so far.

601
00:31:39,826 --> 00:31:42,461
Unless you want to swallow
Glenbogle up completely.

602
00:31:42,462 --> 00:31:44,764
I'll pack the MacDonalds'
bags myself.

603
00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:47,199
I will not be party
to that.

604
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,435
I'm supposed to protect
the estate.

605
00:31:49,436 --> 00:31:52,672
I think you'll find
I'm a much better bet.

606
00:31:52,673 --> 00:31:55,474
If that's the way
you see it,

607
00:31:55,475 --> 00:31:57,876
I might have to withdraw
my support.

608
00:31:57,877 --> 00:32:00,579
Tell the bank you've changed your mind?

609
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,215
That won't do your
reputation a lot of good.

610
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:08,954
Look, we don't have
to fall out about this.

611
00:32:08,955 --> 00:32:11,757
There's a bottle
of champagne in my room.

612
00:32:11,758 --> 00:32:15,127
Why don't we-
drink to success?

613
00:32:15,128 --> 00:32:17,162
Save it for someone
who's in the mood.

614
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:24,704
If I die first,

615
00:32:24,705 --> 00:32:27,406
you have
my permission...

616
00:32:27,407 --> 00:32:30,409
to eat me.

617
00:32:32,245 --> 00:32:35,614
Thank you, Hector,
but I might give that a miss.

618
00:32:43,256 --> 00:32:45,758
Ah-ah- those
are for tomorrow.

619
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:47,926
I thought
you would be out

620
00:32:47,927 --> 00:32:49,895
with your boyfriend
celebrating victory.

621
00:32:49,896 --> 00:32:53,932
Ahem- not tonight,
he's busy.

622
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:56,034
The meeting wasn't
a success then?

623
00:32:56,035 --> 00:32:59,137
I think "complete disaster"
sums it up.

624
00:32:59,138 --> 00:33:00,873
Sorry things
haven't worked out

625
00:33:00,874 --> 00:33:02,875
- the way you wanted them to.
- ( door slams )

626
00:33:02,876 --> 00:33:05,444
- I haven't given up yet.
- Molly: Stop everything.

627
00:33:05,445 --> 00:33:07,212
Marvelous news.
Duncan and I

628
00:33:07,213 --> 00:33:09,214
have found the battlefield
of the Three Hags.

629
00:33:09,215 --> 00:33:11,717
It's exactly where Stuart
plans to build Boglecroft.

630
00:33:11,718 --> 00:33:14,119
Mother, you're a genius.
You can prove this?

631
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,121
Ah, well,
we're working on that.

632
00:33:16,122 --> 00:33:19,692
- Right, you find father. I'll
look for Stella. - Roger and out.

633
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:22,428
Hello, I'm still
here, you know.

634
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:24,630
- I'm sorry?
- I'm supposed to sit here

635
00:33:24,631 --> 00:33:26,899
while you pull the rug out
from under my boyfriend?

636
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,235
Have you got a thought
about maybe working together?

637
00:33:30,236 --> 00:33:32,271
- What, me and Stuart?
- Why not?

638
00:33:32,272 --> 00:33:34,673
Because I don't fancy
another knife in my back.

639
00:33:34,674 --> 00:33:37,576
You're talking about someone
that means something to me.

640
00:33:37,577 --> 00:33:40,245
<i>He actually treats me
with a bit of respect,</i>

641
00:33:40,246 --> 00:33:43,348
which is a welcome change
around here.

642
00:33:43,349 --> 00:33:46,719
If you've any more comments
to make, keep them to yourself.

643
00:33:52,793 --> 00:33:55,394
The Oxford
English Dictionary

644
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:57,262
<i>defines a dungeon
as a "subterranean</i>

645
00:33:57,263 --> 00:33:59,197
<i>stone cellar
for the incarceration</i>

646
00:33:59,198 --> 00:34:01,534
and correction
of the guilty. "

647
00:34:01,535 --> 00:34:04,036
<i>The incarceration
may be over,</i>

648
00:34:04,037 --> 00:34:07,907
but the correction
is about to begin.

649
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,962
I think this is the time of day
it looks its most beautiful.

650
00:34:29,963 --> 00:34:33,999
Yeah, and it'll look
even better once it's framed

651
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,268
<i>by a car park,
a couple of high-rises...</i>

652
00:34:41,608 --> 00:34:43,542
your petition.

653
00:34:43,543 --> 00:34:46,512
You've got four
signatures now.

654
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,250
A sudden change
of heart, isn't it?

655
00:34:52,251 --> 00:34:54,252
You were right
about Stuart.

656
00:34:54,253 --> 00:34:57,723
He would happily destroy
your family's home.

657
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:02,260
I've just given him
the helping hand to do it.

658
00:35:05,866 --> 00:35:08,200
If you were given
the opportunity to pull

659
00:35:08,201 --> 00:35:10,335
out of Boglecroft,
what would you do?

660
00:35:10,336 --> 00:35:13,506
I'd jump
at the chance.

661
00:35:13,507 --> 00:35:16,008
Good, because I need
your help.

662
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,211
Stuart is planning
to build

663
00:35:19,212 --> 00:35:21,480
on a 500-year-old
battlefield.

664
00:35:21,481 --> 00:35:23,382
Once we can prove it,
the council

665
00:35:23,383 --> 00:35:25,350
would have to refuse
planning permission

666
00:35:25,351 --> 00:35:27,219
and the bank will withdraw
its support.

667
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,755
- That's where you come in.
- This can be backed up?

668
00:35:29,756 --> 00:35:31,590
Not yet,
but we're on the case.

669
00:35:34,227 --> 00:35:36,228
With council support
we might be able

670
00:35:36,229 --> 00:35:38,263
to stall Stuart.

671
00:35:38,264 --> 00:35:40,499
<i>We'd need
something tangible,</i>

672
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,135
something of real
historical significance.

673
00:35:45,238 --> 00:35:47,540
But I have done such
a good sell to the bank

674
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:49,808
that they'd probably
press ahead without me.

675
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:51,544
It's worth giving
it a shot.

676
00:35:53,212 --> 00:35:55,047
They'd just laugh
in my face.

677
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:00,118
I'm sorry, but I think
we're going to have

678
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,988
to get used to the idea
of having Stuart around.

679
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:04,924
Marvelous.

680
00:36:04,925 --> 00:36:07,927
At least he won't
try it on with you.

681
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:13,265
Yeah, twice so far. Knowing
him, it won't be the last.

682
00:36:21,374 --> 00:36:23,776
( grunts )

683
00:36:29,015 --> 00:36:31,016
<i>Duncan: What are we digging for, Molly?</i>

684
00:36:31,017 --> 00:36:33,686
- Hard evidence.
- Hard labor more like it.

685
00:36:33,687 --> 00:36:35,688
But if there are
weapons here, I mean,

686
00:36:35,689 --> 00:36:38,356
they could be anywhere.

687
00:36:38,357 --> 00:36:41,259
Trust my luck. I've backed
long shots before and won.

688
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,796
Aye, but my luck's
not that great.

689
00:36:43,797 --> 00:36:46,431
And it's me
that's doing the digging.

690
00:36:46,432 --> 00:36:48,300
<i>Archie: All right, we're here to help.</i>

691
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:50,235
I think I've
strained something.

692
00:36:50,236 --> 00:36:53,205
We're all in this together.
This is our last chance.

693
00:37:08,722 --> 00:37:10,723
( door slams )

694
00:37:12,692 --> 00:37:15,193
<i>Good morning,
o one who must be obeyed.</i>

695
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:17,896
Was your night filled
with eastern promise?

696
00:37:17,897 --> 00:37:19,632
Not exactly, no.

697
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:21,399
Well, if it makes
you feel any better

698
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,202
I had a great night,
me and my man.

699
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:26,204
Here.

700
00:37:26,205 --> 00:37:28,273
Get some of that
in you.

701
00:37:28,274 --> 00:37:30,208
It'll put the sparkle
back in your eyes.

702
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,516
Look, Lex, I know

703
00:37:37,517 --> 00:37:39,518
<i>how fond of him you are
and how he makes you</i>

704
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:41,219
feel good
and everything...

705
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,989
but are you sure
he's okay?

706
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:48,226
Yeah, I am.
He doesn't make me wait.

707
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:52,430
And there's no baggage. That
makes him very okay. Okay?

708
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:57,235
No, not okay.

709
00:37:57,236 --> 00:38:00,205
<i>You know how much
I've always valued you?</i>

710
00:38:00,206 --> 00:38:03,275
Yeah, like
an untouchable vase.

711
00:38:03,276 --> 00:38:06,979
No, as a friend.
Well, more than just a friend.

712
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:14,386
Arch, if you're trying
to tell me something,

713
00:38:14,387 --> 00:38:16,188
just hit me with it.

714
00:38:18,457 --> 00:38:21,193
He... tried on
with her.

715
00:38:21,194 --> 00:38:23,662
<i>With Stella.</i>

716
00:38:23,663 --> 00:38:27,199
In fact, I think he's had his eye
on her since the moment they met.

717
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,201
Don't try and spoil
this for me.

718
00:38:29,202 --> 00:38:32,004
<i>Are you jealous
or something?</i>

719
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:34,173
Is that it? Is he moving
in on your territory?

720
00:38:34,174 --> 00:38:36,775
I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

721
00:38:36,776 --> 00:38:38,811
- I don't know how you can do it.
- What?

722
00:38:38,812 --> 00:38:42,447
Keep a straight face.
You might not like Stuart,

723
00:38:42,448 --> 00:38:44,216
but making up
a story like that,

724
00:38:44,217 --> 00:38:46,651
it's really low.

725
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,791
<i>( door slams )</i>

726
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:03,969
Good boys.

727
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,038
<i>Hector:
Monty, Rommel?</i>

728
00:39:11,577 --> 00:39:14,446
Monty, Rommel?

729
00:39:14,447 --> 00:39:16,581
Where are you?

730
00:39:16,582 --> 00:39:17,883
<i>( dog barks )</i>

731
00:39:17,884 --> 00:39:20,552
Monty, Rommel?

732
00:39:20,553 --> 00:39:22,554
Where are you?

733
00:39:22,555 --> 00:39:24,356
( dogs whimper )

734
00:39:24,357 --> 00:39:26,992
<i>There you are.</i>

735
00:39:26,993 --> 00:39:30,195
What are you doing down here,
you silly old things?

736
00:39:33,466 --> 00:39:35,200
<i>( Ian laughing )</i>

737
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:37,435
Candy from a baby.

738
00:39:37,436 --> 00:39:39,905
<i>This is a great day
for the the Mclntoshes.</i>

739
00:39:39,906 --> 00:39:42,707
I'm not going to risk
having you around to spoil it.

740
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:44,977
( laughing )

741
00:39:55,621 --> 00:39:57,956
- Dunc...?
- ( mumbling )

742
00:39:57,957 --> 00:40:00,292
Breakfast.

743
00:40:00,293 --> 00:40:03,595
( sniffs )
Brilliant.

744
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:07,232
I've been at it
all night.

745
00:40:07,233 --> 00:40:11,236
Yeah, well done.
Listen, keep going.

746
00:40:11,237 --> 00:40:13,238
Sorry, I can't help.
I've got the bridge opening.

747
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,240
Right.
Hey, good luck.

748
00:40:15,241 --> 00:40:16,741
Thanks.

749
00:40:19,245 --> 00:40:21,146
Oi!

750
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:48,506
( wolf whistles )

751
00:40:48,507 --> 00:40:50,309
Who's a smart boy, then?

752
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:52,811
There's a lot of flesh
I want to press today.

753
00:40:52,812 --> 00:40:55,280
Well, let's hope
some of it's mine.

754
00:40:55,281 --> 00:40:58,116
You shouldn't even
have to ask.

755
00:40:58,117 --> 00:40:59,251
( bangs )

756
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,512
<i>Molly: Councilor, surely
you can't stand back</i>

757
00:41:27,513 --> 00:41:30,048
<i>and watch an important piece
of local history</i>

758
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:31,850
go under a bulldozer.

759
00:41:31,851 --> 00:41:33,585
As I told you on the
phone, Mrs. MacDonald,

760
00:41:33,586 --> 00:41:35,320
you hear
so many stories.

761
00:41:35,321 --> 00:41:37,622
We're just asking you
to hold off on Boglecroft.

762
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:39,958
Wait until we get a proper
archaeological survey done.

763
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:43,128
It would be a terrible shame
if you were held responsible

764
00:41:43,129 --> 00:41:45,497
for the destruction
of an historic site.

765
00:41:45,498 --> 00:41:47,532
Save the folklore
for your punters.

766
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:50,568
Stella's already told me
about this quaint local legend.

767
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:54,273
I've had a survey carried out
which revealed nothing.

768
00:41:54,274 --> 00:41:57,142
In that case, we have no
reason to delay any further.

769
00:41:57,143 --> 00:41:59,044
<i>Ian: Absolutely. Let's get on with it.</i>

770
00:41:59,045 --> 00:42:02,214
Don't want to keep your
public waiting, do we, Arch?

771
00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:05,250
<i>( coin pings )</i>

772
00:42:06,986 --> 00:42:08,987
( pings )

773
00:42:10,823 --> 00:42:13,225
( dog growls )

774
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:15,260
- Monty!
- ( growls )

775
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:18,363
It's no use, Monty.
No one will hear you from here.

776
00:42:18,364 --> 00:42:21,666
<i>- ( Monty growls )
- ( barking outside )</i>

777
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:23,835
Winnie?

778
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:24,836
( barks )

779
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:30,242
<i>- Winnie?
- Duncan: Hector?</i>

780
00:42:30,243 --> 00:42:31,609
Winnie?

781
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:46,124
- Duncan!
- Hector!

782
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:49,428
Why don't you use the door
like everyone else?

783
00:42:49,429 --> 00:42:52,965
<i>- It gives me great pleasure...
- ( rapid footsteps )</i>

784
00:42:52,966 --> 00:42:55,300
To welcome you all here
on this very special day,

785
00:42:55,301 --> 00:42:58,236
the grand opening of our
newly repaired bridge.

786
00:42:58,237 --> 00:43:00,939
To be followed by the
sod turning ceremony.

787
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,874
At least let me get
the ribbon cut first.

788
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:05,310
It'd be a better photo if you
gave the scissors to the lady.

789
00:43:05,311 --> 00:43:07,279
Nope, best not, Arch.

790
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,714
The ribbon wouldn't be the only
thing I'd be snipping in half.

791
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:13,018
I think you left these
in the car.

792
00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:15,720
"Stella, let's try again.

793
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:18,590
The champagne's still on ice
if you change your mind. "

794
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:21,526
Aw- she might not have,
but I certainly have.

795
00:43:21,527 --> 00:43:22,995
( grunts )

796
00:43:22,996 --> 00:43:26,231
Did I give you permission
to come courting me?

797
00:43:26,232 --> 00:43:28,500
Did I give you permission
to break my heart?

798
00:43:28,501 --> 00:43:31,436
You're nothing but a lying,
cheating, two-faced-

799
00:43:31,437 --> 00:43:32,904
( yelling )

800
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:34,806
Give him one
for me, Lexie!

801
00:43:37,543 --> 00:43:40,445
If you want him,
you can have him.

802
00:43:40,446 --> 00:43:43,448
Keep that sleazeball
right out of my way!

803
00:43:43,449 --> 00:43:47,152
<i>Stuart:
No doubt, it'll be</i>

804
00:43:47,153 --> 00:43:48,653
the emotion
of the occasion.

805
00:43:48,654 --> 00:43:52,257
Right,
sod turning.

806
00:43:52,258 --> 00:43:54,592
Mother...

807
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:57,829
Archie:
Lexie, Lexie.

808
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:03,402
<i>Archie: I'm not going
anywhere till you talk to me.</i>

809
00:44:05,204 --> 00:44:08,507
<i>I can stay here for days.
I've got the times crossword.</i>

810
00:44:08,508 --> 00:44:10,409
You're useless
at crosswords.

811
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:12,244
<i>Exactly.</i>

812
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,681
You'll be missing
the sod turning.

813
00:44:16,682 --> 00:44:20,218
I couldn't care less.

814
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:22,454
Are you coming out?

815
00:44:22,455 --> 00:44:25,257
( sniffs )

816
00:44:25,258 --> 00:44:27,992
I feel
like such a fool.

817
00:44:27,993 --> 00:44:32,630
He fooled everyone.
Even Stella.

818
00:44:32,631 --> 00:44:36,034
I'll bet you
she's loving this.

819
00:44:36,035 --> 00:44:38,937
<i>It's her who blew
the whistle on him.</i>

820
00:44:38,938 --> 00:44:41,139
( sighs )

821
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:45,043
<i>- I could kick myself.
- I know.</i>

822
00:44:45,044 --> 00:44:47,912
I'm sorry, Lex.

823
00:45:01,327 --> 00:45:03,628
I'm all right.

824
00:45:03,629 --> 00:45:05,697
I'm just cross.

825
00:45:05,698 --> 00:45:07,799
Come here.

826
00:45:11,704 --> 00:45:13,705
That's better.

827
00:45:16,976 --> 00:45:19,377
Are you coming down?

828
00:45:19,378 --> 00:45:23,448
- Is Stuart still around?
- Who cares?

829
00:45:28,887 --> 00:45:32,924
I should begin by saying
thank you to the MacDonalds,

830
00:45:32,925 --> 00:45:35,427
as I think only they
fully realize

831
00:45:35,428 --> 00:45:37,629
<i>how wonderful a moment
this is for me.</i>

832
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,697
Right. ready, lads?

833
00:45:42,401 --> 00:45:44,236
( dogs barking )

834
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,858
- ( barking )
- Yes!

835
00:46:18,504 --> 00:46:21,373
How splendid, we have
a reception committee.

836
00:46:21,374 --> 00:46:23,208
I don't know what sort of
stunt you're trying to pull.

837
00:46:23,209 --> 00:46:26,545
There's a tunnel. It runs all
the way back to the dungeon,

838
00:46:26,546 --> 00:46:29,247
the escape route of your
ancestor. Has to be said,

839
00:46:29,248 --> 00:46:31,449
pretty good digging,
for a Mclntosh.

840
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:34,553
Which proves this is where
the battle was fought.

841
00:46:34,554 --> 00:46:36,421
Let's not get carried away.
It's theory, that's all.

842
00:46:36,422 --> 00:46:38,823
He's right, Mrs. MacDonald,
we have no real evidence.

843
00:46:38,824 --> 00:46:41,660
What's this, then?
The Mclntosh insignia.

844
00:46:41,661 --> 00:46:44,362
As clear as day.
It was in the tunnel.

845
00:46:44,363 --> 00:46:46,264
And these were, too.

846
00:46:46,265 --> 00:46:47,899
Let me have
a look at that.

847
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,335
So much for your
survey, Mr. Mclntosh.

848
00:46:50,336 --> 00:46:53,371
- If it ever existed at all.
- Which I very much doubt.

849
00:46:53,372 --> 00:46:55,607
Come on, Stella,
you're not falling for this?

850
00:46:55,608 --> 00:46:57,576
I'm sorry, but Lascelles
Bank can't be seen

851
00:46:57,577 --> 00:47:00,212
to be supporting the desecration
of an historical site.

852
00:47:00,213 --> 00:47:03,315
In that case, I think
we're finished up here.

853
00:47:03,316 --> 00:47:06,084
Well, you are-
definitely.

854
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,101
I'm going
to enjoy this.

855
00:47:23,102 --> 00:47:26,438
- Have I missed something?
- Boglecroft is history.

856
00:47:26,439 --> 00:47:29,774
- Where's Stuart?
- He's gone. Duncan will fill you in.

857
00:47:29,775 --> 00:47:32,277
I've got to phone the bank,
tell them the deal's off.

858
00:47:32,278 --> 00:47:35,280
Smile, Archie,
you've won.

859
00:47:42,187 --> 00:47:46,023
Case closed. Full account of
Mclntosh's miraculous escape.

860
00:47:46,024 --> 00:47:48,860
What's this? "Three Hags,
imprisonment for two years,

861
00:47:48,861 --> 00:47:51,829
extinct tunnel rediscovered by Duncan mckay

862
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,698
you haven't
mentioned me at all.

863
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:55,767
- Should I have?
- Should you-?

864
00:47:55,768 --> 00:47:57,302
Look at these hands-

865
00:47:57,303 --> 00:48:00,338
raw with clawing my way
out of that tunnel.

866
00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:02,039
Duncan was simply
my servant.

867
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,175
I am sorry, Hector.
I am not changing a word.

868
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:06,444
Duncan deserves
his place in history.

869
00:48:06,445 --> 00:48:08,212
Anyway, come on,

870
00:48:08,213 --> 00:48:10,615
let's go upstairs before
they finish all the food.

871
00:48:10,616 --> 00:48:13,351
Have it your own way-
just a minute, before we go-

872
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:14,986
could you show me
how to work these?

873
00:48:14,987 --> 00:48:17,722
I don't want to charge people,
then mess up when I put it on.

874
00:48:17,723 --> 00:48:19,658
It's quite easy.
Put it on your wrist-

875
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:21,893
no, let me do it to you.
You're the customer, see?

876
00:48:21,894 --> 00:48:23,628
- Over there?
- Yes.

877
00:48:23,629 --> 00:48:25,897
Now, wait a minute.
This is the padlock thing.

878
00:48:25,898 --> 00:48:29,000
- Snap it closed.
- Wait a minute... ah, there we are.

879
00:48:29,001 --> 00:48:31,836
That's it. easy.
Now take it off.

880
00:48:31,837 --> 00:48:35,440
Not until you agree to a revised
version of your Mclntosh saga.

881
00:48:37,242 --> 00:48:39,377
Now, how would it go?

882
00:48:39,378 --> 00:48:42,447
<i>"Hector Naismith
MacDonald...</i>

883
00:48:43,582 --> 00:48:46,785
a champion amongst men"-

884
00:48:46,786 --> 00:48:48,252
blast!

885
00:48:51,457 --> 00:48:54,158
