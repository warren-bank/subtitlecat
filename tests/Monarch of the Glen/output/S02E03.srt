No, Lexie,
just leave it.

I have to clear
this space out anyway.

Well, you're in

00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:42,841
You come in

then you leave
and we decide, okay?

74
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:46,645
Fine.

75
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:51,816
Archie,
the project is sound.

76
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:54,286
You shouldn't have
anything to worry about.

77
00:04:56,222 --> 00:04:57,589

and get her a decent flyer.</i>

83

- Can I hold her?
- Of course you can, yeah.

84
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:27,686
Put on the gauntlet.

88
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:36,928
Just watch she doesn't
mistake you for lunch.

89
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:40,265

to a richer palate.

No, that's all right, Duncan, give
Golly a hand. Not gonna take long, is it?

Naff pottery shops,

You are a regular visitor

What?

164
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:30,161
You argued for the upgrading
of the Glenbogle estate road.

165
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:31,863
Yes, but that was
for the benefit-

166
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:35,099
you proposed the installation of
a new filter plant on the loch.

167
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,735
We all needed the water.

168
00:09:36,736 --> 00:09:39,437
On the sports committee,
you argued-

169
00:09:39,438 --> 00:09:42,373
against the chair's advice-

170
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:46,077
that the sum of �200 was
awarded for the hill race.

171
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:47,779

172
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,781
I'm proud

173
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:51,382
I've got nothing

very carefully to me.

179
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:09,367
You've got a great
future here, Katrina.

180
00:10:09,368 --> 00:10:11,670
It would be
a terrible shame

181
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:14,773
to see it blighted
by allegations of bias.

182
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:21,646
<i>So, I will ask you again.</i>

183
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:25,149
Are you for
or against this plan?

184
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:38,663
Archie, I'm sorry.

185
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:40,131
You didn't even vote
for it.

186
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:41,532
I couldn't do a thing
about it.

187
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,702
Well, I can.
You can tell your cronies

188
00:10:43,703 --> 00:10:46,004
that I'll be back for the
full meeting on Monday.

189
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:47,639
They're not my cronies.

190
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,007
Don't kid yourself,
Katrina.

191
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:51,943
That's exactly what they are
until you stand up to them.

192
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:29,714
Right.

193
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:38,623
Ah, Duncan,
you're a wonder.

194
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:43,028
Right. Let's get that heather burnt

195
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:44,763
up at the north crag.

196
00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:46,698
Something wrong with your wrist, laddie?

197
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:48,432
No, it's just
that Fergal said-

198
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:51,736
- you're right, Duncan.
- Ah. Aye, Fergal.

199
00:11:51,737 --> 00:11:54,973
- Then again- - I haven't
quite finished with the boy yet.

200
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:58,176
So much to do.

201
00:11:58,177 --> 00:11:59,744
Fair is fair, Golly.

202
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:01,512
I said two hours,
you know.

203
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,482
What's so important you have to
drag the lad away from real work?

204
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:06,417
I can't build the aviary
single-handed.

205
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:08,019
Aviary.
Give me strength.

206
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,355
Well, I know you prefer taking
life, rather than preserving it-

207
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:15,293
I've forgotten more about conservation
than you ever learned at your universities-

208
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:17,696
- oh, come on-
- okay, Duncan!

209
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:21,199
Let's go.

210
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:24,235
Golly!

211
00:12:25,337 --> 00:12:27,338
I don't want
to fight with you.

212
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:29,140
But Duncan's my deputy,

213
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:31,109
and we got a lot
to get done today.

214
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,211
<i>Now, Archie
specifically asked us</i>

215
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,546
to get this aviary up
and running as soon as possible.

216
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,116
That's right enough.

217
00:12:38,117 --> 00:12:40,384
Well, so he did.

218
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:43,354
So let's rock and roll.

219
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:09,580
I want to know why you
voted against Archie's plan.

220
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,917
- You know why.
- No, I don't know why.

221
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:18,056
You obviously liked it.
And so did the others.

222
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:19,924
Why don't you
stand up to her?

223
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:23,094
- It's complicated.
- Then explain it to me.

224
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:26,097
I was left completely isolated there.

225
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,399
What are you all
so afraid of?

226
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,238
You'd better
come inside.

227
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:40,544
Yes!
Yes!

228
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:42,013
Yes!

229
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:45,316
How long did it take us to
prepare that presentation, mother?

230
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:46,651
Oh, weeks,
darling.

231
00:13:46,652 --> 00:13:49,120
And how long did it
take them to reject it?

232
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,189
So, you didn't get
the grant then?

233
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,025
No, but I will.
I will.

234
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,662
<i>Hello, is that
the Press and Journal?</i>

235
00:13:57,663 --> 00:13:59,630
Yes, I was wondering
if you're aware

236
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,399
that we have
a council committed

237
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,101
to destroying
local tourism.

238
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:04,836
Mother, what
are you doing?

239
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:07,738
Stopping you making
a fool of yourself.

240
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:11,509
I will get that grant even if it means
taking it to the Scottish Parliament.

241
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,311
You could take it
to the United Nations,

242
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,680
<i>but that committee still
wouldn't give you a bean.</i>

243
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:17,515
Why?

244
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:19,583
Because it's chaired
by Edith Rankin.

245
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:21,252
And what's that
to me?

246
00:14:21,253 --> 00:14:23,354
I think you'd better speak
to your father.

247
00:14:24,423 --> 00:14:25,656
Right.

248
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,793
<i>Father?</i>

249
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:30,528
Have you ever bowled,
Miss Finlay?

250
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:32,030
<i>No.</i>

251
00:14:32,031 --> 00:14:34,299
Crown green bowling.

252
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,801
The smell
of new-mown grass...

253
00:14:36,802 --> 00:14:39,370
the click of ebony
on ebony...

254
00:14:44,844 --> 00:14:47,745
I was the president
of Glenbogle Bowling Club

255
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:51,149
in its glory year- 1961.

256
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,819
We didn't have
a green of our own then,

257
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,021
which meant we
couldn't join the league.

258
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,991
So we decided to build one.

259
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:09,033
I found
the perfect site.

260
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,602
Two hectares
of virgin turf

261
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:13,371
overlooking the loch.

262
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,974
It would've been the best
in the highlands.

263
00:15:18,277 --> 00:15:20,478
Edith was against it.

264
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,849
She said
the money would pay

265
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,018
for an electronic
voting system

266
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:29,153
for our chamber.

267
00:15:29,154 --> 00:15:32,924
<i>So I took a stand.</i>

268
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:37,929
I took her on...

269
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,630
head to head.

270
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:40,831
And what happened?

271
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:43,234
She destroyed me.

272
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,203
<i>For the next 15 years,</i>

273
00:15:45,204 --> 00:15:47,805
I was in charge
of public toilets

274
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:49,774
and litter bins.

275
00:15:50,842 --> 00:15:52,710
Take my word for it.

276
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:56,647
If you want to stay
at council in Glenbogle,

277
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:59,150
you must keep
your mouth shut...

278
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:00,919
and your ears open.

279
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:11,362
Father?

280
00:16:11,363 --> 00:16:13,264
<i>( whirring )</i>

281
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,537
Father?

282
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,508
Father,
are you up there?

283
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:33,284
Father?

284
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,230
<i>( dog whines )</i>

285
00:16:57,443 --> 00:17:00,511
I haven't been in
this old place for years.

286
00:17:00,512 --> 00:17:02,413
Splendid, isn't it?

287
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:03,982
My little den.

288
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:07,751
What do I need to know
about Edith Rankin?

289
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:09,854
Your mother
wants to turn it

290
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:11,956
into some glorified cupboard,
but...

291
00:17:11,957 --> 00:17:13,691
I wouldn't change it
for the world.

292
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:14,959
Edith Rankin.

293
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,363
I think
I need some air.

294
00:17:18,364 --> 00:17:20,865
Father.

295
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:22,666
Oh.

296
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,004
Oh, yes,

297
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:28,606
Edith and I were at
primary school together.

298
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:31,609
She used to come up here
in her father's delivery van

299
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,745
with the groceries.
She was quite a tomboy.

300
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:36,347
Very, um,
resourceful.

301
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:37,681
And?

302
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,951
Well, we grew up,
stayed friends.

303
00:17:40,952 --> 00:17:42,720
Just friends?

304
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:45,223
I'd see her
at the odd dance.

305
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:46,657
Did you...

306
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:49,693
no, I most certainly did not!
I behaved honorably throughout.

307
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,795
There must be
more to it than that.

308
00:17:51,796 --> 00:17:53,898
Well, she may have had
a bit of a...

309
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:55,566
crush on me.

310
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:57,935
<i>Anyway, when I was 18
I went off to the army,</i>

311
00:17:57,936 --> 00:18:00,371
came back four years later
married to your mother.

312
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,873
Edith seemed to take the hump
of the whole family.

313
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,809
<i>Never darken my doors again,
all that.</i>

314
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,812
She even hissed at me in the
street. Profoundly embarrassing.

315
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:12,083
When was this?
When did you last speak to her?

316
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:15,319
- 1962.
- ( sighs )

317
00:18:23,362 --> 00:18:25,496
<i>Fergal: You all right to finish up here?</i>

318
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:27,598
'Cause I got
to get moving now.

319
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,599
Aye.

320
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:31,769
<i>Um...</i>

321
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,906
is this not a bit big
for just the one owl?

322
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,442
Right.

323
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:39,677
Do you know...
what this...

324
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:42,380
you have no idea what
I'm up to here, do you?

325
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:44,148
No.

326
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:48,919
Better come with me.

327
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:56,360
( squawks )

328
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:58,729
<i>Fergal:
From this point here</i>

329
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,599
<i>to the north tip of the estate
and over to the loch-</i>

330
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,401
<i>that's 45,000 acres,
right?</i>

331
00:19:03,402 --> 00:19:04,835
<i>Duncan: aye.</i>

332
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:07,472
<i>For too long this land
has been a killing ground.</i>

333
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:09,607
<i>If it moves,
stalk it,</i>

334
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,842
<i>catch it,
shoot it.</i>

335
00:19:11,843 --> 00:19:13,344
<i>Those days
are over.</i>

336
00:19:13,345 --> 00:19:14,845
<i>Yeah?</i>

337
00:19:14,846 --> 00:19:16,481
<i>With a bit
of imagination</i>

338
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:17,781
<i>and a lot
of hard work,</i>

339
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,517
Glenbogle could
be the premier

340
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:21,385
wildlife reserve
of Scotland.

341
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:23,287
We could
reintroduce species

342
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:24,555
that have been
driven out.

343
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:26,991
<i>Sea eagles,
red squirrels,</i>

344
00:19:26,992 --> 00:19:28,493
otters...

345
00:19:28,494 --> 00:19:30,894
all running wild
in their own habitat.

346
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:33,797
But what about the stalking
and the grouse?

347
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,032
No.
No, forget that.

348
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:37,101
<i>I'm talking about
the future here,</i>

349
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:38,869
not the past.

350
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,239
But to make it
happen...

351
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,906
I need something.

352
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,710
- What?
- Your support.

353
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:49,046
Me?

354
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:50,914
100%.

355
00:19:50,915 --> 00:19:52,783
Are you up for it?

356
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:55,886
Am I- you bet!

357
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,122
Good on you!

358
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:01,359
Now get that aviary finished.

359
00:20:04,763 --> 00:20:07,765
Hey, Fergal, you forgot your D.G.P.S.!

360
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:10,268
Keep it.
It's yours!

361
00:20:15,207 --> 00:20:16,807
Believe me,
Archie, I-

362
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:18,409
I'm truly, truly sorry.

363
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,844
If there's anything
I could do, I would.

364
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,346
There is something
you can do.

365
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,581
Yes?

366
00:20:23,582 --> 00:20:25,483
You can call
on Edith Rankin,

367
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:28,286
apologise to her, and get
her to back the scheme.

368
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,654
Call on her?

369
00:20:29,655 --> 00:20:30,988
You can't ask me
to do that.

370
00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:32,390
I can,

371
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:33,724
and you will.

372
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:35,025
I absolutely will not!

373
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,395
Under no circumstances
will I approach

374
00:20:37,396 --> 00:20:38,929
that desiccated harpy!

375
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,834
( sputtering )

376
00:20:44,903 --> 00:20:47,371
- Come on!
- How dare you!

377
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,407
I didn't drive
through Aden

378
00:20:49,408 --> 00:20:50,675
on a Bren gun tank

379
00:20:50,676 --> 00:20:52,042
to be treated
like this!

380
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,944
Get in, mother,
maximum security!

381
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:55,513
Oh, no, you don't!

382
00:20:55,514 --> 00:20:58,282
Now... here's a rosebud.
She'll like that.

383
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,552
<i>( engine starts )</i>

384
00:21:02,754 --> 00:21:05,423
They're terrified
of her.

385
00:21:05,424 --> 00:21:08,125
I can't blame them.

386
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:10,294
She's completely
stitched me up.

387
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:12,496
I was totally useless.

388
00:21:12,497 --> 00:21:15,165
- You're not useless.
- Yes, I am.

389
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,602
Look, you went down
in the first round,

390
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:19,903
just count to eight
and come up punching.

391
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,905
Golly, I'm so angry.

392
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,174
There's nothing
I can do about it.

393
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:26,611
<i>- yes, there is.
- What?</i>

394
00:21:26,612 --> 00:21:28,779
A man once said,
don't get mad...

395
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,114
get even,

396
00:21:30,115 --> 00:21:33,150
<i>right? So if she's
got files on you,</i>

397
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:35,018
you get a filing cabinet
on her.

398
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:37,788
If she threatens you
with public embarrassment,

399
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:40,324
you promise her
public humiliation.

400
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:42,727
That's the way
to deal with Rankin.

401
00:21:43,828 --> 00:21:44,995
Right.

402
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:46,930
Although speaking
personally for myself,

403
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,733
I don't think
he got it quite right.

404
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:50,968
'Cause what I say
is get mad...

405
00:21:52,404 --> 00:21:53,904
and then get even.

406
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:32,209
Archie: Father, there's
no point in complaining.

407
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,444
All right!

408
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,547
Come on.

409
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:39,283
Outrageous! This is bally
abduction, you do realise that!

410
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:42,019
- Molly: Stop that at once!
- Father, come on, this way.

411
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,422
- I don't know what to say to her!
- I've told you what to say!

412
00:22:44,423 --> 00:22:45,690
<i>I was going
fishing today!</i>

413
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:47,658
( arguing )

414
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,293
Ring the bell.

415
00:22:49,294 --> 00:22:50,394
The bell.

416
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:58,001
<i>( rings doorbell )</i>

417
00:23:10,882 --> 00:23:12,450
<i>( door opens )</i>

418
00:23:15,387 --> 00:23:16,721
Hello, Edie.

419
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,923
Hello, Biscuit.

420
00:23:19,924 --> 00:23:20,958
Biscuit?

421
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,426
Oh!

422
00:23:22,427 --> 00:23:23,828
Biscuit.

423
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:25,463
I...

424
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:27,598
just popped over
for a chat.

425
00:23:31,436 --> 00:23:32,737
<i>( squawks )</i>

426
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:52,857
( squawks )

427
00:24:06,004 --> 00:24:08,472
Aye, Marra, what a fine job it is.

428
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:13,477
Aye.
Well.

429
00:24:13,478 --> 00:24:14,845
Listen, Golly,

430
00:24:14,846 --> 00:24:16,480
I wanted to say sorry-

431
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:18,248
oh, pish, laddie.

432
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:19,850
<i>It should be me
apologising to you.</i>

433
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:21,952
<i>The lad Fergal,
hammering away like that,</i>

434
00:24:21,953 --> 00:24:23,788
put you in a...

435
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:26,290
put you in
a difficult position.

436
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:29,560
- Well- - no, look,
you see, it's just...

437
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:31,995
when you get
to my age, it's...

438
00:24:31,996 --> 00:24:34,164
difficult adapting
to changes, you know?

439
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:36,801
Especially when you're losing
the company of a...

440
00:24:36,802 --> 00:24:38,335
a really good friend.

441
00:24:38,336 --> 00:24:40,037
Me?

442
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:42,506
Now, look, uh... I just-
I'd like to give you this,

443
00:24:42,507 --> 00:24:44,608
<i>wish you all the best
in your-</i>

444
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:45,976
<i>in your new job.</i>

445
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:53,050
You got that
from your father.

446
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:55,453
Aye.
He got it from his.

447
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:56,720
Here.

448
00:25:02,193 --> 00:25:04,227
It's beautiful,
but I couldn't-

449
00:25:04,228 --> 00:25:06,330
who else am I gonna
give it to, son?

450
00:25:06,331 --> 00:25:08,098
I don't know
what to say.

451
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:13,604
Uh, look, I'd better
get on my way.

452
00:25:13,605 --> 00:25:15,806
Heather won't burn
by itself.

453
00:25:18,209 --> 00:25:20,377
All right,
I'll see you.

454
00:25:22,514 --> 00:25:24,682
Golly!

455
00:25:24,683 --> 00:25:26,283
Hang on a minute.
I'll give you a hand.

456
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:28,385
No, no, I don't-
I don't want you-

457
00:25:28,386 --> 00:25:30,554
I don't want to put you
to any trouble.

458
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:32,656
Och, away.

459
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,358
An hour won't matter.

460
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:36,093
Okay.

461
00:25:36,094 --> 00:25:38,061
Grand.

462
00:26:01,553 --> 00:26:03,988
So...

463
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:06,657
to what do I owe
this pleasure?

464
00:26:08,727 --> 00:26:09,793
Still one lump?

465
00:26:09,794 --> 00:26:10,995
Oh!

466
00:26:10,996 --> 00:26:12,763
Yes, of course.

467
00:26:12,764 --> 00:26:14,164
<i>Uh, ahem!</i>

468
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:17,200
To tell the truth, Edith,
it's about my boy.

469
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,570
Archie.

470
00:26:19,571 --> 00:26:21,005
Fine young lad.

471
00:26:21,006 --> 00:26:23,140
Indeed. We're all
very proud of him.

472
00:26:23,141 --> 00:26:25,409
<i>He intends to resubmit
his plans for the estate</i>

473
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,511
to the full council.

474
00:26:27,512 --> 00:26:29,580
Yes, I heard him-

475
00:26:29,581 --> 00:26:31,982
shouting as much
in the street.

476
00:26:31,983 --> 00:26:34,418
He's a very passionate
young man, Edith.

477
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:37,655
<i>I can't overstate
how important this project is</i>

478
00:26:37,656 --> 00:26:39,557
to him. I mean...
if this fails,

479
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:41,324
I don't know
where we're gonna go.

480
00:26:43,094 --> 00:26:44,461
You remembered!

481
00:26:44,462 --> 00:26:46,196
Pardon?

482
00:26:46,197 --> 00:26:47,898
The rose of Glenbogle.

483
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:50,233
From your mother's garden.

484
00:26:51,937 --> 00:26:53,671
Oh, yes, of course!

485
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:59,509
The 13th of August...

486
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,045
1958.

487
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,747
Yes.

488
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:05,783
The night you left
for the army.

489
00:27:05,784 --> 00:27:07,718
And your family
held a ball

490
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:09,954
at Glenbogle
in honor of you.

491
00:27:11,022 --> 00:27:12,355
Happy days.

492
00:27:12,356 --> 00:27:15,626
We danced the buckles
off our shoes!

493
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:18,829
And after the last waltz,
you took me out to the garden.

494
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,431
<i>We held hands</i>

495
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:24,367
<i>and looked at the moonlight
on the loch,</i>

496
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:28,639
and you swore
you'd return.

497
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,342
And, aye,
you plucked me a rose...

498
00:27:32,343 --> 00:27:34,544
as a token...

499
00:27:34,545 --> 00:27:36,279
<i>as a promise.</i>

500
00:27:37,582 --> 00:27:39,683
<i>And I waited, Hector.</i>

501
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:42,352
I had offers-

502
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:44,755
but I waited.

503
00:27:44,756 --> 00:27:46,523
Four years.

504
00:27:46,524 --> 00:27:50,728
<i>Four long years.</i>

505
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:52,429
<i>And then you came back.</i>

506
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:55,332
Married.

507
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:59,269
<i>You walked
into my father's shop,</i>

508
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,138
and do you remember
what you said?

509
00:28:03,074 --> 00:28:05,876
"Half a pound
of beef links. "

510
00:28:07,045 --> 00:28:08,646
Half a pound-

511
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:10,280
of beef links.

512
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:14,051
You broke my heart,
Hector Naismith MacDonald!

513
00:28:14,052 --> 00:28:15,953
Oh, come on now.
Steady on.

514
00:28:15,954 --> 00:28:17,420
Not one word!

515
00:28:17,421 --> 00:28:19,623
For 40 years!

516
00:28:19,624 --> 00:28:21,959
Not one Christmas card!

517
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,628
<i>Not one glance
in the street!</i>

518
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:27,698
<i>And now you have
the barefaced gall</i>

519
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:29,967
to come here
pleading for money?

520
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:32,169
<i>Let me tell you,</i>

521
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,337
hell will freeze over

522
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:37,741
before one penny piece
of council money

523
00:28:37,742 --> 00:28:40,077
is spent
in the cursed environs

524
00:28:40,078 --> 00:28:41,712
of Glenbogle House!

525
00:28:42,881 --> 00:28:45,849
( stammering apologies )

526
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,608
Both: Well?

527
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:14,344
I think the rose
was a mistake.

528
00:29:23,454 --> 00:29:25,355
( humming )

529
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:29,960
<i>( squawks )</i>

530
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:31,661

531
00:29:31,662 --> 00:29:33,296
( squawks )

532
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:40,503
Golly: Okay, we should
have this done by 6:00,

533
00:29:40,504 --> 00:29:42,906
and then we'll
walk around, Duncan.

534
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,742
I'm up for that,
Golly!

535
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:48,445
You know, it's good
to be away up here.

536
00:29:48,446 --> 00:29:49,980
I mean,
out from the house.

537
00:29:49,981 --> 00:29:53,217
Then there'll be more
to do tomorrow, laddie.

538
00:29:53,218 --> 00:29:54,985
<i>Well, you can
count me in.</i>

539
00:30:06,564 --> 00:30:08,232
What are you doing
up here?

540
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:09,599
He's working
with me.

541
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,402
- The owl's escaped!
- What?

542
00:30:12,403 --> 00:30:15,672
If you're daft enough to keep
vermin in cages, what do you expect?

543
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:18,308
The owl's got out and you're
gonna find her. Come on!

544
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:20,778
Is that what you call
authority? Shouting at the boy?

545
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,479
<i>- What?
- bellowing at him.</i>

546
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,481
Do you think that'll
make him do what you want?

547
00:30:24,482 --> 00:30:27,350
I don't know how you got him up
here, but I bet it wasn't his idea!

548
00:30:27,351 --> 00:30:29,052
You'd lose your bet,
laddie.

549
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:31,454
Okay then.

550
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,323
All right,
let's see, shall we?

551
00:30:33,324 --> 00:30:34,324
Duncan.

552
00:30:35,426 --> 00:30:38,361
Duncan, my man...

553
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:39,696
<i>what do you
want to do?</i>

554
00:30:39,697 --> 00:30:42,365
Do you want to stay here
and play with fire,

555
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:43,967
or do you want
to come with me,

556
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,837
and really do something
useful with your life?

557
00:30:46,838 --> 00:30:49,072
- I...
- what's it gonna be?

558
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:55,979
Aw, this isn't right!

559
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:00,717
- Duncan?
- Duncan!

560
00:31:00,718 --> 00:31:02,886
<i>Fergal:
Duncan, come back!</i>

561
00:31:31,582 --> 00:31:33,450
Lexie.

562
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:41,291
No, go on.

563
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:42,926
No, it's...

564
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:44,027
okay.

565
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:54,804
Why do you never see
two owls in the rain?

566
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,442
'Cause it's
too wet to woo,

567
00:31:59,443 --> 00:32:02,579
two wet to woo. Ha ha!

568
00:32:07,318 --> 00:32:09,286
Please yourselves.

569
00:32:35,713 --> 00:32:37,214
( sighs )

570
00:32:37,215 --> 00:32:38,615
<i>( gate opens )</i>

571
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:47,391
( kicks door )

572
00:32:47,392 --> 00:32:48,892
Duncan!

573
00:32:51,062 --> 00:32:52,796
( kicks )

574
00:32:52,797 --> 00:32:55,465
Come on, Duncan!

575
00:32:55,466 --> 00:32:57,834
I've got food
for you.

576
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,239
<i>The owl might come back.</i>

577
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,075
Okay?
Please yourself.

578
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,765
Not a peep out of him.

579
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:31,234
Poor lad'll starve
if he carries on like this.

580
00:33:33,904 --> 00:33:36,139
I hope you two
are proud of yourselves.

581
00:33:46,351 --> 00:33:48,952
Molly:
Oh, Archie.

582
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:51,621
Go to your bed.

583
00:33:51,622 --> 00:33:54,157
I can't sleep,
mother.

584
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:55,925
Don't worry
about the grant.

585
00:33:55,926 --> 00:33:57,927
Something
will turn up.

586
00:33:57,928 --> 00:34:01,365
I wish I had
your optimism.

587
00:34:01,366 --> 00:34:03,566
But you've got
determination.

588
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:06,370
If anyone can
do it... you can.

589
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:10,207
Don't stay up
too late.

590
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,943
Good night, mother.

591
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:56,253
Archie?
Archie, wake up.

592
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,925
- Hi.
- Here, take this.

593
00:35:01,926 --> 00:35:03,360
You're going
to need it.

594
00:35:04,995 --> 00:35:07,497
The woman has consistently
bullied, pressurised,

595
00:35:07,498 --> 00:35:09,899
and subverted
every single member

596
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,102
of this committee
at one time or another.

597
00:35:12,103 --> 00:35:13,370
<i>Look at this.</i>

598
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:14,704
Alistair's
bowling green-

599
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:16,406
rejected.

600
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:17,674
The post office
extension,

601
00:35:17,675 --> 00:35:19,776
and look, the new florist conservatory,

602
00:35:19,777 --> 00:35:21,311
and the butcher's
street display

603
00:35:21,312 --> 00:35:22,845
all got the same
treatment.

604
00:35:22,846 --> 00:35:24,981
But every
single scheme

605
00:35:24,982 --> 00:35:26,649
that had
her name on it-

606
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,286
got passed.
Look at this.

607
00:35:29,287 --> 00:35:30,987
<i>And this,</i>

608
00:35:30,988 --> 00:35:32,655
and this.

609
00:35:32,656 --> 00:35:34,491
This is all
very interesting,

610
00:35:34,492 --> 00:35:38,228
but what good will it do me?
They're far too scared of her.

611
00:35:38,229 --> 00:35:39,896
But don't you see?

612
00:35:39,897 --> 00:35:42,099
They all must have
an ax to grind.

613
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,267
If we can persuade
them to pull together,

614
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:46,136
we could get them
to overthrow her,

615
00:35:46,137 --> 00:35:47,804
and Rankin would
lose her power.

616
00:35:47,805 --> 00:35:49,973
All we have to do
is nobble the committee

617
00:35:49,974 --> 00:35:51,575
<i>before the meeting.</i>

618
00:35:51,576 --> 00:35:53,943
You're becoming devious,
Miss Finlay.

619
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:57,280
No, I'm not.
I'm becoming a politician.

620
00:36:12,863 --> 00:36:14,831
Come on, Duncan!

621
00:36:17,235 --> 00:36:19,603
Duncan?

622
00:36:19,604 --> 00:36:21,238
Duncan!

623
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:28,545
<i>- ( leaves rustle )
- ( bird flushes )</i>

624
00:36:28,546 --> 00:36:30,247
Dash it.

625
00:36:32,082 --> 00:36:34,417
<i>- ( cat yowls )
- No.</i>

626
00:36:34,418 --> 00:36:37,320
- Lexie: Have you seen Duncan?
- Not since last night.

627
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:39,289
I saw him heading up
towards Benbogle.

628
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,358
Right. We better get after him.

629
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,426
When we find him
we'll call you.

630
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:45,995
- I'm coming with you.
- What happens if he calls here?

631
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:48,898
Would you mind buzzing off?
You're in my line of fire.

632
00:36:48,899 --> 00:36:50,267
Come on.

633
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:56,939
( splashes )

634
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,176
- Bull's-eye!
- Ha ha ha!

635
00:37:17,562 --> 00:37:20,797
Katrina: We just have to have
the courage to stick together.

636
00:37:20,798 --> 00:37:22,999
And the others
have agreed?

637
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,002
Only on the condition
that you vote with us.

638
00:37:26,003 --> 00:37:27,404
They respect you.

639
00:37:27,405 --> 00:37:29,939
Edith will be
devastated.

640
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,842
The council's
her whole life.

641
00:37:32,843 --> 00:37:34,678
I could never hurt her
in that way.

642
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:36,246
She'd get over it.

643
00:37:36,247 --> 00:37:37,914
What if the motion failed?

644
00:37:37,915 --> 00:37:40,149
I've got a lot to lose.

645
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,484
And a lot to gain.

646
00:37:41,485 --> 00:37:44,487
If you stand up to her now,
who knows what might happen?

647
00:37:44,488 --> 00:37:46,489
Imagine how proud
your old mates would be,

648
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:49,226
as you unveiled
the Glenbogle Bowling Green.

649
00:37:49,227 --> 00:37:51,528
The smell of newly-mown grass...

650
00:37:51,529 --> 00:37:54,531
the click
of ebony on ebony...

651
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,535
it's too risky.

652
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:02,772
Just think about it,
Alistair, please.

653
00:38:02,773 --> 00:38:05,275
You could really
help us out.

654
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:24,894
<i>Fergal calling:
Duncan!</i>

655
00:38:24,895 --> 00:38:26,429
( echoing )

656
00:38:27,698 --> 00:38:29,766
Duncan!

657
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:39,342
Duncan!

658
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:04,668
( squawks )

659
00:39:09,173 --> 00:39:10,740
So...

660
00:39:10,741 --> 00:39:13,643
that concludes all
the business of the day.

661
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:16,179
Katrina:
No. No, it doesn't.

662
00:39:17,581 --> 00:39:20,082
I'd like to propose an
appeal to reverse the decision

663
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:21,685
<i>of the tourism
committee,</i>

664
00:39:21,686 --> 00:39:24,487
on the matter of the
Glenbogle Adventure Center.

665
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:27,357
I understood we had
resolved that matter.

666
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:29,559
Not to
my satisfaction.

667
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,362
( murmuring )

668
00:39:32,363 --> 00:39:33,663
Silence!

669
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:38,568
Well, do I hear
a seconder?

670
00:39:40,538 --> 00:39:42,439
<i>Edith: no?</i>

671
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,607
<i>Grand. Perhaps in the future</i>

672
00:39:44,608 --> 00:39:45,842
you won't waste
our time

673
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:47,977
with pointless
interruptions.

674
00:39:47,978 --> 00:39:50,680
So you can get
your way as usual?

675
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:52,882
That's what we're all
here for, isn't it?

676
00:39:52,883 --> 00:39:55,985
I don't have to justify
anything to you, madam.

677
00:39:55,986 --> 00:39:59,088
I have given my life
to this council.

678
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:01,558
There is not one decision
we've ever taken

679
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:03,259
that I can't defend.

680
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,695
Katrina: What about the
extension to the post office?

681
00:40:05,696 --> 00:40:06,963
Too disruptive.

682
00:40:06,964 --> 00:40:09,265
Or the conservatory
at the florist's?

683
00:40:09,266 --> 00:40:11,968
Too distracting
for motorists.

684
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:14,103
What about the new
crown bowling green?

685
00:40:14,104 --> 00:40:16,373
Too damn childish.

686
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:20,410
Time after time,
I have been forced to make

687
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:22,211
unpopular decisions,

688
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:25,047
but my judgment has always
been proved right.

689
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:28,050
Even Mr. Reid has to agree

690
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,487
that my analog
conferencing network

691
00:40:30,488 --> 00:40:32,422
is a damn sight
more useful

692
00:40:32,423 --> 00:40:34,323
than a silly patch
of grass

693
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:36,659
and some
overgrown marbles.

694
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,661
Enough!

695
00:40:38,662 --> 00:40:40,096
<i>Enough.</i>

696
00:40:40,097 --> 00:40:43,132
How dare you!
How dare you dismiss

697
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:45,835
the hopes and dreams
of good and decent people?

698
00:40:45,836 --> 00:40:48,070
I'll second
Miss Finlay's motion,

699
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,239
with pleasure!

700
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,341
<i>If we don't support
our local youngsters...</i>

701
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:58,114
we deserve less respect
than the dogs in the street!

702
00:40:58,115 --> 00:40:59,949
I move to the vote.

703
00:41:17,802 --> 00:41:21,070
The motion is passed.

704
00:41:21,071 --> 00:41:23,172
<i>( cheering, applause )</i>

705
00:41:29,413 --> 00:41:32,949
So... what now?

706
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,485
Right. Uh...

707
00:41:35,486 --> 00:41:38,555
you try over there.
I'll go up here.

708
00:41:38,556 --> 00:41:40,356
I'll go up here.

709
00:41:40,357 --> 00:41:42,124
- The road's easier.
- What?

710
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,060
I'll go up here.
That way's easier.

711
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:45,227
What do you mean?

712
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:48,331
I'm just saying
this way's steeper.

713
00:41:48,332 --> 00:41:52,134
You saying I can't manage
a wee bitty hill?

714
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,437
Let's face it,
Golly,

715
00:41:54,438 --> 00:41:56,405
you're no
spring chicken.

716
00:41:56,406 --> 00:41:59,108
I've just about had it
with your smart wee remarks.

717
00:41:59,109 --> 00:42:00,109
Yeah?

718
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,144
So what are we
gonna do about it?

719
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:04,046
Suppose we settle it
here and now?

720
00:42:04,047 --> 00:42:05,615
All right.

721
00:42:07,618 --> 00:42:09,486
<i>Duncan:
Look at you!</i>

722
00:42:09,487 --> 00:42:11,253
You're pathetic!

723
00:42:11,254 --> 00:42:13,389
<i>Both of you!</i>

724
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:16,025
The whole place is
turning into a midden!

725
00:42:16,026 --> 00:42:18,528
And all you can do
is fight!

726
00:42:18,529 --> 00:42:21,297
You seem to think I'm
some sort of village idiot

727
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:24,033
that can be bribed
into supporting you!

728
00:42:24,034 --> 00:42:26,503
Well, I'm not!

729
00:42:26,504 --> 00:42:28,571
Here's your fancy
global positioning,

730
00:42:28,572 --> 00:42:30,239
and there's
your hand-tooled gun!

731
00:42:32,075 --> 00:42:34,043
<i>If we can't work
together,</i>

732
00:42:34,044 --> 00:42:36,012
<i>all of us,</i>

733
00:42:36,013 --> 00:42:38,915
then the estate's
gonna go belly up,

734
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:42,284
and it's gonna be
your fault!

735
00:42:46,624 --> 00:42:48,424
I'm away
to see Archie.

736
00:42:48,425 --> 00:42:50,560
I've got the owl,
Lex.

737
00:42:50,561 --> 00:42:52,929
Would you give me
a lift, please?

738
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:08,511
<i>( door opens )</i>

739
00:43:14,852 --> 00:43:17,954
Come to rub salt in,
have you?

740
00:43:17,955 --> 00:43:20,723
No, not at all.

741
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:22,358
Actually...

742
00:43:24,061 --> 00:43:27,564
we've come to invite
you to a celebration.

743
00:43:27,565 --> 00:43:30,199
So that I can be paraded
in defeat.

744
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,902
There are no winners
or losers here, Edith.

745
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:35,572
You don't know
politics, Katrina.

746
00:43:35,573 --> 00:43:37,406
It's a cruel business.

747
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,042
I want to work
with you...

748
00:43:39,043 --> 00:43:40,610
not against you.

749
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:43,880
<i>You've got
so much to offer.</i>

750
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:45,915
Please, come with us.

751
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:48,217
To that house?

752
00:43:48,218 --> 00:43:50,887
I could never
go back there.

753
00:43:50,888 --> 00:43:52,254
<i>Never.</i>

754
00:44:00,163 --> 00:44:02,231
Miss Rankin,

755
00:44:02,232 --> 00:44:04,033
I know how
you must feel.

756
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:08,437
There's no pain
like old pain,

757
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,807
twisting inside you,
buried so deep

758
00:44:10,808 --> 00:44:13,943
that nothing or nobody
can touch it.

759
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:15,645
I know.

760
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,048
And we can't change
the past, can we?

761
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:24,186
But we can hope
for a better future,

762
00:44:24,187 --> 00:44:27,657
and try to enjoy
the present.

763
00:44:27,658 --> 00:44:30,593
I'd be honored
if you'd come to my home

764
00:44:30,594 --> 00:44:33,496
and grace us
with your presence.

765
00:44:33,497 --> 00:44:35,064
Please.

766
00:44:38,268 --> 00:44:41,270
To the Glenbogle
Adventure Center!

767
00:44:41,271 --> 00:44:42,639
All: Cheers.

768
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,907
<i>Hector: I knew the lad had it in him.</i>

769
00:44:44,908 --> 00:44:47,010
I told you I had it all
under control.

770
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:48,477
Of course
you did, dear.

771
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:51,413
The heroes
return!

772
00:44:52,783 --> 00:44:55,284
Anybody wants a sherbet,
sherbet's right here.

773
00:44:55,285 --> 00:44:56,519
Help yourselves.

774
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,088
( party chatter )

775
00:44:59,089 --> 00:45:00,957
- Come here.
- Watch it-

776
00:45:02,026 --> 00:45:03,960
somebody wants
to speak to you.

777
00:45:03,961 --> 00:45:07,096
Oh, for heaven's sake, can't you
see I'm engaged in vital war work?

778
00:45:07,097 --> 00:45:08,898
In the garden now.

779
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:10,033
- Oh.
- Go on.

780
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,871
Beer?

781
00:45:14,872 --> 00:45:16,005
Sure.

782
00:45:55,145 --> 00:45:56,645
Edie.

783
00:45:57,881 --> 00:45:59,148
Hello, Biscuit.

784
00:46:00,217 --> 00:46:01,383
Edie...

785
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,319
I'd like to apologise
for my behavior

786
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,787
all those years ago.

787
00:46:04,788 --> 00:46:06,555
I'm truly, truly sorry.

788
00:46:07,858 --> 00:46:10,392
I haven't seen this view
for 40 years.

789
00:46:11,494 --> 00:46:13,830
<i>It's such a waste.</i>

790
00:46:13,831 --> 00:46:15,664
Such a waste.

791
00:46:15,665 --> 00:46:17,800
I-

792
00:46:17,801 --> 00:46:20,269
I knew you had
feelings for me, and...

793
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,305
I took fright, I suppose.
That's why I never made contact.

794
00:46:23,306 --> 00:46:25,208
Damn callous of me.

795
00:46:25,209 --> 00:46:27,910
Will you- will you
try to forgive me?

796
00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:34,250
Yes, Hector.

797
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:35,251
I will.

798
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,521
Welcome back
to Glenbogle.

799
00:46:40,624 --> 00:46:42,258
Come here.

800
00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:49,932
Shall we go in?

801
00:46:57,307 --> 00:46:59,976
You were magnificent
in there today.

802
00:46:59,977 --> 00:47:01,543
I owe you everything.

803
00:47:01,544 --> 00:47:03,079
No, you don't.

804
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,714
I was just helping out
one of my constituents.

805
00:47:05,715 --> 00:47:07,183
Is that all it was?

806
00:47:15,092 --> 00:47:17,359
Sorry to be
a party pooper, Archie.

807
00:47:18,695 --> 00:47:20,396
You ready?

808
00:47:20,397 --> 00:47:22,398
Fergal's taking me
out to dinner.

809
00:47:22,399 --> 00:47:24,033
Oh.

810
00:47:24,034 --> 00:47:25,334
Right.

811
00:47:25,335 --> 00:47:26,635
<i>Well...</i>

812
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:29,105
well, uh,
enjoy yourselves.

813
00:47:29,106 --> 00:47:30,639
We will.

814
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,808
<i>See you later.</i>

815
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:44,887
Welcome, Edith,
welcome.

816
00:47:44,888 --> 00:47:46,189
Thank you.
