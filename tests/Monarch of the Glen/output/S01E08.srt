<i>Hector: I'm only
obeying orders.</i>

00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:07,236
<i>Archie: Not right now, father, please.</i>

3
00:00:07,237 --> 00:00:10,139
In your very interesting lecture,
"Glenbogle, the Business,"

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,909
You said, and I quote, "good
communications is at the heart

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,645
- Of every thriving enterprise,"
so- - when I get back, okay?

6
00:00:15,646 --> 00:00:17,547
There's a spot of damp
in the wine cellar.

7
00:00:17,548 --> 00:00:19,749
I thought it imperative you
be informed without delay.

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,050
Thank you very much.

9
00:00:22,586 --> 00:00:23,920
Archie.

10
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:27,189
I can't stop. I've gotta
get Justine from the airport.

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,225
When you get back,
I want to talk to you

12
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:31,293
About your responsibilities
as a landlord.

13
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:34,497
I've just been to see some of your
properties and they're in a terrible state.

14
00:00:34,498 --> 00:00:37,033
Great, another conversation
to look forward to.

15
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:49,712
Justine, how are you?

16
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:53,783
Let's just get this
over with, shall we?

17

19
00:01:38,796 --> 00:01:40,830
Hector:
Right. Careful.

20
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:48,170
Golly:
Damp, you said.

21
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:51,007
Yes. Dear, oh dear-
hello!

22
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:52,942
What have we here?

23
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:56,378
Ho ho, we're in luck.

24
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:59,482
Chateau Lafite '55.
Marvelous.

25
00:02:08,558 --> 00:02:10,559
Archie: Would you come to Glenbogle?

26
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,598
- To live?
- Mm-hmm.

27
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,600
Are you asking
me to?

28
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:19,502
I just wanted
to know.

29
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:23,072
A hypothetical question.

30
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:26,743
No, Archie.
I wouldn't.

31
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:28,745
My life's in London.

32

35
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:39,789
Our work.

36
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,625
Right.

37
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:44,694
And Glenbogle's
not for me.

38
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:46,529
Your father's right,

39
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,999
I'd never make a Laird's
wife in a million years.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,635
In any case...

41
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:56,139
You have plenty of other
candidates, don't you?

42
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,207
Oh, I don't suppose
he'll remember.

43
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,143
Never does.

44
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:03,646
Sorry, as you were. He
did remember our 25th.

45
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:06,049
Even gave me
a gift,

46
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,450
The collected works
of Sir Walter Scott,

47
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:10,319
Bound in deerskin.

48
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,421
It sadly wasn't
properly cured

49
00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:14,623
And the dogs tore it
to bits one day

50
00:03:14,624 --> 00:03:16,759
In a wild,
animalistic frenzy.

51
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:21,130
I'm going to be leaving
Glenbogle, Lexie.

52
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,399
I've been
offered a job

53
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,069
As an exotic dancer
in Las Vegas.

54
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,904

55
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:30,306
What did you say?

56
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:33,910
I wonder how
Archie's getting on?

57
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:37,146
Aye.

58
00:03:37,147 --> 00:03:39,082
Poor Archie.

My family.

to buy a share.

67
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,985
- Lennie?
- He's a terrific chef.

68
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:18,687
And a bit of a dish
himself, yes?

69
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:20,823
What do you say?

70
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,194
Well, I'd like a few days
to think it over,

<i>- If that's all right.
- P.A.: 7947 to London Gatwick.</i>

than for you to turn me down.

leaving Glenbogle-</i>

78
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:53,522

The lady loves.

158
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,585
- Alan, I've told you!
- I was going to abseil down the chimney

159
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:18,820
But I thought I might
get soot on my strides.

00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:21,257
I don't want
nut clusters!

161

I want
peace and quiet!

162

And personal space.

163
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:27,763
I love
your anger.

164
00:09:27,764 --> 00:09:30,266

- man: Yoo-hoo.</i>

175
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:18,147
<i>- Archie: The thing is I-
- man: Anybody home?</i>

176
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:20,983
- I know that voice.
- Ta-da!

177
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:23,552
Fleming! Oh, my wee banker man!

178
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:27,423
- Not that daft gowk again.
- Hello, one and all.

179
00:10:27,424 --> 00:10:30,759
- What are you doing here?
- Just had a meeting in Aberdeen.

180
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,663
- Thought I'd pop over.
- Look at you, Flem, the gear.

181
00:10:34,664 --> 00:10:36,932
I know.
Cost me a fortune.

182
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:39,168
But I thought I'd be
properly dressed this time.

183
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:42,538
- Look, this watch has got a compass
underneath it. - That'll be handy

184
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:45,241
When you're trying to find the
bathroom in the middle of the night.

185
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:47,042
So...
Another inspection

186
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:49,278
By our favorite
financial advisor, is it?

187
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,213
Come to give us
the once over?

188
00:10:51,214 --> 00:10:53,149
I very much hope so, Lexie.
( snorts )

189
00:10:54,551 --> 00:10:56,185
Oh, hello, Duncan.

190
00:10:57,521 --> 00:11:00,856
Mr. Fleming, you must
stay for the weekend.

191
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:02,724
( sighs )

192
00:11:04,427 --> 00:11:06,895
<i>Fleming: And the sporting
side and paying guests</i>

193
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:08,864
<i>Are starting
to produce decent income.</i>

194
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:12,501
You're almost
not making a loss.

195
00:11:12,502 --> 00:11:15,337
- Well done.
- Thanks.

196
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,775
But, um...

197
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:22,844
You didn't really have a
meeting in Aberdeen, did you?

198
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:24,746
No.

199
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:29,418
The thing is, I've tried
to protect you from the bank.

200
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:31,987
My boss just found out
that I'd let you

201
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:34,890
Increase that whacking
great debt of yours.

202
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:38,126
- He went bananas.
- Oh, dear.

203
00:11:38,127 --> 00:11:40,563
I hope we haven't
got you into trouble?

204
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:43,732
Oh, no, no.

205
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:46,235
No, um...

206
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:48,204
But now he wants blood

207
00:11:48,205 --> 00:11:50,706
And if he can't have
bucketfuls of yours-

208
00:11:50,707 --> 00:11:52,808
He'll make do with mine.

209
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:57,213
I see.

210
00:11:57,214 --> 00:11:59,047
Sorry, Archie...

211
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:01,684
But I'm afraid you need
to produce a wedge of dosh now,

212
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:03,819
For me to take back
to London.

213
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,759
I'm, um... I'm thinking of selling out

214
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,229
My share
in the restaurant.

215
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,264
Is that entirely wise?

216
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:18,133
Sink all your capital
into these old stones?

217
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:20,436
Who else
is gonna do it?

218
00:12:20,437 --> 00:12:22,304
Fair point.

219
00:12:22,305 --> 00:12:25,507
All the same,
radical step.

220
00:12:25,508 --> 00:12:27,909
No going back.

221
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,412
I'd appreciate it if
you kept it to yourself.

222
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:33,282
I haven't made
my mind up just yet.

223
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:35,584
( sighs )

224
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:37,753
( humming )

225
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,924
<i>Archie: It's either more
income or less expansion,</i>

226
00:12:42,925 --> 00:12:45,026
<i>And I can't see
how to do either.</i>

227
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:48,297
- Why don't you realize some assets?
- What assets?

228
00:12:48,298 --> 00:12:51,700
I don't know... Like flogging
off some cottages in the village

229
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:55,337
- That you let for two and thruppence
ha'penny a week? - What, sell the village?

230
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:57,306
Still, Archie,
at least the fabric

231
00:12:57,307 --> 00:12:59,375
Of this place is
in reasonable nick.

232
00:12:59,376 --> 00:13:02,745
Hector: Ah! Memo to Chief Executive,
Glenbogle Enterprises inc.:

233
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:05,046
Don't forget to inspect
touch of damp

234
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:08,384
In wine and spirits department.
Thank you.

235
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:11,052
<i>- ( water dripping )
- Archie: "touch of damp"?</i>

236
00:13:12,622 --> 00:13:15,891
Admirable aptitude for
understatement, your father.

237
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:28,771
- Oh, here. I'll take that.
- Thanks, wee man.

238
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:30,739
I know I give you
a hard time sometimes.

239
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,708
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:36,244
You're a sweetie.

241
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,692
Boss, boss? Can I have a word of advice?

242
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:52,160
From me?
You must be joking.

243
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:57,199
- I'm sorry, what is it?
- Well, the thing is...

244
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,335
If you cared
for someone

245
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:01,503
But you never
ever thought

246
00:14:01,504 --> 00:14:04,540
- That she cared back...
- Uh-huh?

247
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,375
And then she started
being nice to you,

248
00:14:06,376 --> 00:14:09,110
I mean, really, really
nice, no more sniping,

249
00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:11,880
No cracks or jokes,
what would you think?

250
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,451
I'd think that
it was my lucky day.

251
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:17,619
That maybe...
She'd seen the real me,

252
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,356
- Maybe even fallen a little
bit in- - you really think?

253
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:23,425
<i>- Man: Mr. MacDonald?!
- Coming.</i>

254
00:14:25,962 --> 00:14:27,863
In love with-

255
00:14:27,864 --> 00:14:29,331
Lexie!

256
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,401
Duncan?

257
00:14:34,537 --> 00:14:36,372
Lexie... Darling,

258
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:39,207
I fancy you rotten-
no.

259
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:44,913
I'm sweet on you,

260
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:46,815
And I really-

261
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:49,651
You know, and I think
that you may be...

262
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:51,420
Just a bit...

263
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:56,191
So why don't me and you-

264
00:14:56,192 --> 00:14:58,694
<i>( couple laughing )</i>

265
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,933
No, my dear Lexie,
till you came along,

266
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:07,536
Life was pretty barren
on the femininity front.

267
00:15:07,537 --> 00:15:09,805
You must have had
girlfriends though?

268
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:13,409
Careful with your plurals,
hope of my heart.

269
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,144
<i>Well, what was she like? Was she pretty?</i>

270
00:15:17,313 --> 00:15:19,214
She looked a bit like-

271
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:22,451
Do you know a football manager
called Harry Redknapp?

272
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:25,487
My dad used to say about
my gran, "I'm not saying

273
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:28,223
She's ugly, but when
she puts her makeup on,

274
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:30,358
The lipstick starts
backing up into the tube. "

275
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:33,929
But listen, Flem,

276
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,264
I mean you're funny,
young...

277
00:15:36,265 --> 00:15:37,999
<i>- ish,</i>

278
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,736
Good job, if a bit
on the dull side...

279
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:43,806
Quite nice looking.

280
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:45,607
What's the problem here?

281
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:48,243
You tell me.
It's just...

282
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:50,946
When I meet girls,
they seem to take

283
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:53,682
An instant dislike to me.
Why, I've no idea.

284
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:56,585
- Maybe it just saves time.
- Beg your pardon?

285
00:15:57,887 --> 00:16:00,188
Flem, you're good
for me.

286
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:02,858
That, my dear, is my
main purpose in life.

287
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,462
So you enjoyed
your trip to London?

288
00:16:06,463 --> 00:16:08,964
Amazing.
Far too short.

289
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:11,366
We'll put that right
next time.

290
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,804
<i>I was very upset you
didn't come to see me.</i>

291
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:19,207
- And how are we going to get rid of it?
- Pump it all out.

292
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,443
Lay some drains
from here to the loch.

293
00:16:21,444 --> 00:16:23,812
Put in a pump that
kicks in automatically

294
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:26,181
When it rains.
Fairly simple.

295
00:16:26,182 --> 00:16:27,950
Right.

296
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:30,051
So far.

297
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:32,087
There is
something else.

298
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:36,391
- Look at this.
- What is it?

299
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:38,894
Crack in
load bearing wall.

300
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:42,063
- Subsidence.
- Oh, no.

301
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:44,265
I'll need to inspect
the rest of the house.

302
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:46,768
And you'd better go and do
what people always do

303
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:49,237
In these
unfortunate situations.

304
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:53,709
I must be the biggest
booby in Glenbogle!

305
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,177
- What?
- I should have known.

306
00:16:56,178 --> 00:16:58,680
She goes down to London
her usual scratchy self

307
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:00,549
And comes back
like Mary Poppins.

308
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,585
- Not now, Duncan.
- And who lives in London?

309
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:05,521
That little banker.

310
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:09,791
- He's had his way with her.
- Here we are.

311
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:12,427
I've just heard them
cooing on each other

312
00:17:12,428 --> 00:17:14,563
Like a couple
of rock doves.

313
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:18,099
He's wrecked my life.
But I'll have my revenge.

314
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,435
- You'll see.
- Right.

315
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:23,805
You don't think she
loves him, do you?

316
00:17:24,908 --> 00:17:26,775
Oh, horrible.

317
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:28,510
Horrible!

318
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:32,948
Okay, right.

319
00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:34,950
Just tell me
things can't get any-

320
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:42,190
Here...

321
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:43,992
And here.

322
00:17:43,993 --> 00:17:47,563
- You haven't noticed?
- There are 43 rooms here.

323
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:50,265
I haven't been in some
of them since I was a boy.

324
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:52,634
The evidence is there
for all to see.

325
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:54,570
This whole wing
of the house

326
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:56,404
Is sinking fast.

327
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:58,239
The place is unsafe.

328
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,442
My strong advice is
to get everyone out,

329
00:18:00,443 --> 00:18:02,010
And now-

330
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:04,179
While we get
the builders in.

331
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,683
- How much?
- I'm only a surveyor, Mr. MacDonald, but...

332
00:18:07,684 --> 00:18:10,586
I don't think you'll get much
change out of six figures.

333
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:13,622
Ach, but don't worry, in my
experience, the insurance companies

334
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:15,958
Are very good with
this sort of thing.

335
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:18,961
They might be if you still
had a policy with them.

336
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:20,896
Oh dear, oh dear.

337
00:18:20,897 --> 00:18:23,398
Thank you for coming
so quickly, Mr. Aitcheson

338
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:25,366
- I appreciate it.
- Aye.

339
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:42,550
The commanding officer of
the food police sent me.

340
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:45,386
She and Molly are concerned
you might fade away

341
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:47,689
Without immediate
ingestion of luncheon.

342
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,225
Ooh! Ah!

343
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:52,227
That hurt.

344
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,864
Something wrong?

345
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:58,634
Just a small problem
of maintenance.

346
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:02,437
I don't think the bank
can help out this time,

347
00:19:02,438 --> 00:19:04,205
Much as I'd like to.

348
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:08,076
Should I sell out, Fleming? You
know, my share of the restaurant?

349
00:19:09,378 --> 00:19:11,579
You could, but-

350
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,682
Look, Archie,
I love this place,

351
00:19:13,683 --> 00:19:15,550
But it's a black hole.

352
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:18,687
Fleets of �50 notes
are sent into it and...

353
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:20,388
Never seen again.

354
00:19:22,925 --> 00:19:24,760
I'd better rejoin
the ladies.

355
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:27,262
Ow! Oh...

356
00:19:27,263 --> 00:19:29,264
What on earth?

357
00:19:36,238 --> 00:19:39,174
<i>( radio music,
humming )</i>

358
00:20:00,396 --> 00:20:02,397
Justine.

359
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:04,332
- Hello?
- ( beeps )

360
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,603
Hello, goodbye.

361
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,219
Hey, lady of the lake, how do
you fancy a spin around the loch?

362
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,388
Can't, Captain Birdseye.
I've got the dinner to cook.

363
00:20:27,389 --> 00:20:30,358
Thought I might have a go after
I've peeled the spuds for you.

364
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,594
Haven't played Swallows
and Amazons for years.

365
00:20:38,968 --> 00:20:40,969
Oh, Hector,
this reminds me,

366
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,138
I've been thinking
about our anniversary,

367
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:45,841
- Perhaps having a small party?
- Nonsense, darling.

368
00:20:45,842 --> 00:20:48,643
Who needs celebrations when
every day of our long...

369
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:51,113
( together ) and apparently
endless marriage...

370
00:20:51,114 --> 00:20:53,181
Is like the first
day of Spring, eh?

371
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:55,117
Mother, father,
I need to talk to you.

372
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,855
I mean... Can't you just leave it?

373
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:02,090
It might just...
Go away.

374
00:21:02,091 --> 00:21:04,726
It isn't safe to stay
here. We have to move out.

375
00:21:04,727 --> 00:21:07,195
Temporary, you mean,
while the builders fix it?

376
00:21:07,196 --> 00:21:09,030
Yes.

377
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:11,466
How very boring,
not to say inconvenient.

378
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:12,834
Hector!

379
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:15,103
I suppose Kilwillie could
put us up for a couple of weeks.

380
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:17,305
There is something else.

381
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:19,574
The bank are insisting
that we reduce the debt.

382
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:21,576
Fleming can't
hold them off any longer.

383
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:24,646
Oh, dear.

384
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:27,115
Insurance policy can't
sort that one out?

385
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:28,483
No.

386
00:21:28,484 --> 00:21:30,852
What are you going
to do, Archie?

387
00:21:33,222 --> 00:21:35,190
When I saw Justine,

388
00:21:35,191 --> 00:21:37,492
She offered to buy me out
of the restaurant.

389
00:21:37,493 --> 00:21:39,127
Oh, Archie.

390
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:41,062
You two haven't
split up, have you?

391
00:21:42,265 --> 00:21:44,332
It could solve
our problems.

392
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,268
<i>- Well, some of them.
- Hector: Capital.</i>

393
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:48,369
You mustn't.
You mustn't do this.

394
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,472
- It's not your concern, Molly.
- Throwing good money after bad,

395
00:21:51,473 --> 00:21:53,675
Ruining your relationship with Justine.

396
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:56,544
He is a MacDonald of Glenbogle,
of the 16th generation.

397
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:59,514
Nothing would please me
more than for you to stay

398
00:21:59,515 --> 00:22:01,983
And settle here, but it
must be your own decision.

399
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,085
He is the Laird
of this ancient house.

400
00:22:04,086 --> 00:22:07,088
He holds it in sacred trust for his
children and grandchildren to come!

401
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:10,091
Please, don't argue.
It just makes it worse.

402
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:12,727
Archie, listen,
we still haven't resolved

403
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:14,930
This business
about your tenants.

404
00:22:14,931 --> 00:22:18,033
- Mrs. McLeod's kitchen's in an awful state.
- Can I say something?

405
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:21,002
- She's got a damp patch the size of
the North Sea. - A damp patch?

406
00:22:21,003 --> 00:22:24,306
- You wanna see a damp patch? I'll
show you a damp patch. - Archie!

407
00:22:29,778 --> 00:22:31,579
<i>Archie,
this is terrible.</i>

408
00:22:33,382 --> 00:22:36,017
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.

409
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:38,153
Throw myself into it.

410
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,192
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

411
00:22:48,764 --> 00:22:50,531
Ahh.

412
00:23:27,103 --> 00:23:30,171
Help! Help,
I'm sinking.

413
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:32,440
He-e-elp!

414
00:23:34,076 --> 00:23:36,411
Help!
Help, I'm sinking!

415
00:23:36,412 --> 00:23:38,113
Help! Help!

416
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:39,714
<i>He-e-elp!</i>

417
00:23:42,018 --> 00:23:44,886
Help, I'm going under!

418
00:24:09,045 --> 00:24:11,413
Roast loin of pork
with a herb crust.

419
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:14,449
- Yum.
- So perhaps we should get our heads together

420
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,352
About what to take, Lexie. I must say

421
00:24:17,353 --> 00:24:20,055
I'm rather looking
forward to my little break.

422
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:22,123
Though I
sometimes wish

423
00:24:22,124 --> 00:24:23,925
I could make it
permanent.

424
00:24:25,094 --> 00:24:27,362
<i>It is seasoned,
Hector.</i>

425
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:30,432
Archie, perhaps you'd tell
your father that it is an insult

426
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:33,868
To the cook to fling condiments on
a carefully prepared dish like that.

427
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:36,671
Perhaps you'd tell your
mother to mind her own business

428
00:24:36,672 --> 00:24:39,341
And keep her elegant nose
out of my dinner.

429
00:24:39,342 --> 00:24:41,009
( sneezes )

430
00:24:49,852 --> 00:24:52,320
I had a brain wave.

431
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:55,423
- You know that notion of selling
the village, Archie? - Oh, yeah?

432
00:24:55,424 --> 00:24:57,993
I thought of someone who
might give you a good price.

433
00:24:59,328 --> 00:25:01,496
What do you mean
"sell the village"?

434
00:25:01,497 --> 00:25:04,665
Another client of the bank-
rather good client, actually-

435
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:07,235
Who?

436
00:25:07,236 --> 00:25:09,537
Your friend and neighbor,
Kilwillie.

437
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:11,373
Kilwillie?!

438
00:25:11,374 --> 00:25:13,574
<i>He said that that land
once belonged</i>

439
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:16,177
To his family, Mr. MacDonald,
till yours stole it

440
00:25:16,178 --> 00:25:19,647
With considerable grievous
bodily harm, in 1588.

441
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:21,182
He wants it back

442
00:25:21,183 --> 00:25:23,485
And is happy to pay
big time for it.

443
00:25:23,486 --> 00:25:25,186
Over my dead body!

444
00:25:25,187 --> 00:25:27,422
That can easily be arranged.

445
00:25:27,423 --> 00:25:29,724
Now look here-
( sneezes )

446
00:25:29,725 --> 00:25:31,626
Mr. Fleming,

447
00:25:31,627 --> 00:25:33,794
That sounds
an excellent idea.

448
00:25:36,265 --> 00:25:39,834
- Where are you going?
- The stench of betrayal

449
00:25:39,835 --> 00:25:41,903
Has ruined my appetite.

450
00:25:43,906 --> 00:25:46,241
Ah-ha-choo!

451
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:52,147
Quite a tempting proposition,
though, isn't it?

452
00:25:54,383 --> 00:25:56,851
"my client's a man
who insists

453
00:25:56,852 --> 00:25:58,753
On hearing bad news

454
00:25:58,754 --> 00:26:01,356
Immediately. "
( chuckles )

455
00:26:01,357 --> 00:26:04,292
<i>- Lexie: Dunc! Are you there?
- Just a minute.</i>

456
00:26:05,461 --> 00:26:07,195
Dinner's on the table.

457
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:12,067
What are you doing?

458
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:13,568
Nothing.

459
00:26:15,137 --> 00:26:17,004
Just...

460
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:18,673
A bit of... butchery.

461
00:26:20,443 --> 00:26:22,410
I'll be there
in a minute.

462
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:31,953
Oh, have you seen
the ketchup?

463
00:26:31,954 --> 00:26:33,888
Nah.

464
00:27:28,377 --> 00:27:30,345
( screaming )

465
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:34,482
<i>( scream echoing )</i>

466
00:27:35,717 --> 00:27:37,385
<i>Lexie: Hector?</i>

467
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:39,053
Hector?

468
00:27:40,322 --> 00:27:41,989
There's no sign?

469
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,459
He can't have got far.
Must be sulking somewhere.

470
00:27:50,232 --> 00:27:52,066
( whimpers )

471
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:54,001
Darling, what's up?

472
00:27:54,002 --> 00:27:55,637
Aah!

473
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:05,713
Hi, sweetheart.

474
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:07,948
I came to see you,
but you were on the phone.

475
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:10,451
You only had muesli,
so I went down the shops

476
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:12,953
For some sugar puffs.
And bacon and eggs.

477
00:28:12,954 --> 00:28:15,156
Fancy a fry-up?
I'm starved.

478
00:28:15,157 --> 00:28:17,158
Would you stop blathering?

479
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,327
I'm not interested
in a running commentary

480
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,129
- Of your fascinating morning.
- Okay.

481
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:25,132
And would you look
at this place!

482
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:28,069
You have no right
to come in here and-

483
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,206
- I live here, you know?
- Oh, really?

484
00:28:31,207 --> 00:28:33,575
You've hardly been in
since I got here.

485
00:28:33,576 --> 00:28:35,476
I'm trying hard
not to see

486
00:28:35,477 --> 00:28:38,279
A cause and effect
relationship between the two.

487
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,549
- I never asked you to come, Alan.
- I'm aware of that.

488
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:44,652
I came because
I needed to see you.

489
00:28:45,954 --> 00:28:48,556
I hoped you might
begin to reciprocate.

490
00:28:51,694 --> 00:28:53,595
I'm sorry.

491
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:01,236
<i>I also came to look
at property.</i>

492
00:29:01,237 --> 00:29:04,839
I thought... I might
buy a place here...

493
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,209
<i>Base myself here.</i>

494
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,279
So we could be together.

495
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,815
What do you think of that?
As if I didn't know.

496
00:29:16,218 --> 00:29:17,952
Alan, I...

497
00:29:20,222 --> 00:29:22,923
Your silence
is eloquent.

498
00:29:22,924 --> 00:29:25,326
I'm away down at pub.

499
00:29:27,095 --> 00:29:28,896
<i>( door opens )</i>

500
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:30,798
<i>Archie: Duncan!</i>

501
00:29:32,134 --> 00:29:33,768
Duncan!

502
00:29:35,704 --> 00:29:37,605
Golly?

503
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:39,574
What are you doing?

504
00:29:39,575 --> 00:29:41,342
<i>Uh... Nothing.</i>

505
00:29:41,343 --> 00:29:43,844
Just- just
measuring the grass.

506
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:47,649
You have surpassed
yourself this time!

507
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,485
There I was, being all
sympathetic about your problems,

508
00:29:50,486 --> 00:29:53,120
- And then I hear your solution.
- What are you talking about?

509
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:55,490
Selling the land from
underneath our feet!

510
00:29:55,491 --> 00:29:58,125
Homes that people have
lived in for generations.

511
00:29:58,126 --> 00:30:00,161
Nothing's been decided.

512
00:30:00,162 --> 00:30:02,163
Don't deny it.
It's all over the village.

513
00:30:02,164 --> 00:30:04,131
I don't doubt it.
Who needs the internet

514
00:30:04,132 --> 00:30:06,133
When we have the good
women of Glenbogle?

515
00:30:06,134 --> 00:30:09,270
- Thank you very much, Lexie.
- And flogging it to some millionaire

516
00:30:09,271 --> 00:30:11,339
Like it was
a rich man's plaything.

517
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,140
Well, it's not.

518
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:15,276
It's a living,
breathing community,

519
00:30:15,277 --> 00:30:18,946
And I demand you discuss
this mess with me right now.

520
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:21,182
With you?

521
00:30:21,183 --> 00:30:24,352
As a democratically elected
member of the Highland Council.

522
00:30:24,353 --> 00:30:26,321
Ah, of course.
Well, maybe-

523
00:30:26,322 --> 00:30:28,389
Maybe you could
look at it this way:

524
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,958
I am one of your
constituents. I have problems.

525
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:33,227
Am I, therefore, not
worthy of your help,

526
00:30:33,228 --> 00:30:36,331
<i>- Your sympathy, your understanding?
- ( Hector clears throat )</i>

527
00:30:36,332 --> 00:30:38,433
- What is it?
- Hector!

528
00:30:39,735 --> 00:30:43,037
Father?
What are you doing?

529
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,073
Rooftop protest. What
those jailbirds get up to.

530
00:30:46,074 --> 00:30:48,275
What, on the balcony
outside my bedroom?

531
00:30:48,276 --> 00:30:50,745
I'm not coming down
till you come to your senses.

532
00:30:50,746 --> 00:30:54,248
This is childish, even by
your own spectacular standards.

533
00:30:54,249 --> 00:30:57,618
You don't know the half
of this estate's problems.

534
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:00,588
I'm taking no food,
but ask Lexie to send up

535
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:03,524
<i>Another flask and some
more old Country Lifes.</i>

536
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:07,662
<i>Duncan!</i>

537
00:31:08,964 --> 00:31:10,598
The thing is, Lexie,

538
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:13,868
When it comes right down to it,
all men are bampots.

539
00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:15,770
You'll be
telling me next

540
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:17,872
Dolly Parton has
to sleep on her back.

541
00:31:17,873 --> 00:31:19,807
And definitely not
worth fighting over.

542
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,577
No, but it's kinda nice when
they're fighting over you.

543
00:31:22,578 --> 00:31:24,945
And what is Archie,
anyway?

544
00:31:24,946 --> 00:31:28,416
The sorry product
of centuries of inbreeding.

545
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:30,718
You know the term
"gene pool"?

546
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:33,588
Isn't that where Duncan
washes his trousers?

547
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:35,623
Well, this family's
been swimming

548
00:31:35,624 --> 00:31:37,658
In a tiny one
for too long,

549
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:41,095
And the heir apparent's
sinking, in more ways than one.

550
00:31:41,096 --> 00:31:44,265
Aye, they need some vigorous
working class spermies

551
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:46,634
To get them going
right enough.

552
00:31:46,635 --> 00:31:50,037
Speaking of which, do you
know how Golly got his name?

553
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:54,008
<i>A woman down the village
told me.</i>

554
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:56,444
<i>Apparently,
one summer years ago,</i>

555
00:31:56,445 --> 00:31:58,646
When Hector could
afford more staff,

556
00:31:58,647 --> 00:32:01,449
Golly took a bonnie
young lass to a dance,

557
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,885
Gay gordoned
the stockings off her

558
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:06,788
- And took her down by the river.
- For a canoodle?

559
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:09,690
One thing led to another,
as they do,

560
00:32:09,691 --> 00:32:11,626
She unbuttoned her frock,

561
00:32:11,627 --> 00:32:13,795
He undid his-

562
00:32:13,796 --> 00:32:15,763
And she was so amazed,

563
00:32:15,764 --> 00:32:18,900
So flabbergasted
by what confronted her,

564
00:32:18,901 --> 00:32:22,036
- She cried...
- Both: Golly!

565
00:32:27,142 --> 00:32:28,910
What's up?

566
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:32,012
( both giggling )

567
00:32:33,982 --> 00:32:36,451
Apart from the fact that
Mr. Fleming represents the bank

568
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:39,754
To which the estate is indebted,
he is in this house as a guest.

569
00:32:39,755 --> 00:32:41,456
Cuckoo in the nest,
you mean.

570
00:32:41,457 --> 00:32:43,524
I also consider him
a friend!

571
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:45,593
Are you gonna
sack me then?

572
00:32:45,594 --> 00:32:47,862
No, of course not. But you
have to apologize to him.

573
00:32:47,863 --> 00:32:49,697
<i>- Oh, no!
- Yes.</i>

574
00:32:49,698 --> 00:32:51,632
I'd rather cut
my own tongue out!

575
00:32:51,633 --> 00:32:53,468
You're making
this very difficult.

576
00:32:53,469 --> 00:32:55,837
See-

577
00:32:55,838 --> 00:32:58,339
I'm fond of Lexie,

578
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,775
Maybe you noticed.

579
00:33:00,776 --> 00:33:03,678
<i>Anyway, this fella slimed
his way in and had a-</i>

580
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,213
<i>- A dalliance with her.
- Dalliance?</i>

581
00:33:06,214 --> 00:33:08,816
She went down to London
to be with him and he-

582
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:10,918
He...

583
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,187
I can hardly bring myself
to say it. He...

584
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:15,055
Despoiled her.

585
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:17,492
Of course he didn't.
She never even saw him.

586
00:33:17,493 --> 00:33:20,728
- How do you know?
- Because she was with me all the time.

587
00:33:20,729 --> 00:33:22,697
<i>I never let her
out of my sight.</i>

588
00:33:22,698 --> 00:33:25,466
<i>We even shared a sleeper
compartment on the way home.</i>

589
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:28,469
- What?!
- What?!

590
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,238
So it was you that was doing
the despoiling, was it?

591
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:33,240
No, of course not.
We never-

592
00:33:33,241 --> 00:33:35,309
It was nothing really.

593
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:39,480
- Wha- what was nothing?
- Well, I... We...

594
00:33:39,481 --> 00:33:41,649
<i>- Well, we just-
- you dirty-</i>

595
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,985
How could you, Archie?
After all I've done for you.

596
00:33:43,986 --> 00:33:47,622
Right, that's it.
I'm done with this place.

597
00:33:47,623 --> 00:33:49,390
And you.

598
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:52,493
<i>I offer the hand
of friendship...</i>

599
00:33:52,494 --> 00:33:55,029
And all I get back
is the tickle of cold steel

600
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,464
Between the shoulder blades.

601
00:33:57,465 --> 00:33:59,500
Mr. Fleming...

602
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:01,636
May I tender
my sincere apologies?

603
00:34:03,071 --> 00:34:05,272
- Accepted, Duncan.
- Right.

604
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:07,441
Let's you and me
leave this toe-rag

605
00:34:07,442 --> 00:34:09,343
And go
and get pished.

606
00:34:15,984 --> 00:34:17,752
( sighs )

607
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:25,125
Hello, Archie.

608
00:34:32,434 --> 00:34:34,501
Hello, mother.

609
00:34:34,502 --> 00:34:36,437
What's wrong?

610
00:34:38,506 --> 00:34:41,442
Why is it I can never
do anything right?

611
00:34:41,443 --> 00:34:44,645
Oh, my special child.

612
00:34:44,646 --> 00:34:46,614
Let me tell you
something-

613
00:34:46,615 --> 00:34:49,283
For me, you could never
do anything wrong.

614
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,622
There's no insurance policy,
is there?

615
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:58,325
The last premium
wasn't paid.

616
00:34:58,326 --> 00:35:01,261
I have to find 100,000 and
that's just for starters.

617
00:35:01,262 --> 00:35:03,698
You tried to keep it
from us to protect us.

618
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:05,766
<i>- ( arguing )
- what is it now?</i>

619
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:08,202
<i>- Lexie: Will somebody just explain?
- I said no.</i>

620
00:35:08,203 --> 00:35:10,404
Duncan, for heaven's
sake. Fleming, please.

621
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:14,108
I find I'm unable to speak
to you just now, Alexandra.

622
00:35:16,344 --> 00:35:18,445
- Lexie: What?
- Flem: I-

623
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:20,380
That is to say,
we-

624
00:35:20,381 --> 00:35:23,250
My friend Duncan and I,
are disappointed,

625
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:26,220
Nay, hurt,
by your actions.

626
00:35:26,221 --> 00:35:28,222
What's going on
down there?

627
00:35:29,324 --> 00:35:32,526
- Lexie.
- Archie, how could you?

628
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:35,562
- Let me explain, I-
- your father's right.

629
00:35:35,563 --> 00:35:37,632
You're a cad
and a bounder.

630
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:41,168
- Where are you going?
- I'm not gonna speak to you ever again.

631
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:43,638
At least not until
you make it right.

632
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:46,406
- Come on up, child. What's
going on? - Just the usual-

633
00:35:46,407 --> 00:35:48,843
<i>- Everyone having fun at your son's expense.
- Archie?</i>

634
00:35:48,844 --> 00:35:52,246
<i>- Not now, please. - Katrina: I'm not here
to give you unwanted advice.</i>

635
00:35:52,247 --> 00:35:54,882
It's up to you what
you do with your life.

636
00:35:54,883 --> 00:35:57,952
- It's got nothing to do with me after all.
- Eh?

637
00:35:57,953 --> 00:36:00,921
Except, in so far as it
affects my constituents.

638
00:36:00,922 --> 00:36:03,924
<i>- Katrina, why don't you just shut up?
- What?</i>

639
00:36:03,925 --> 00:36:06,994
As usual, you are speaking to me with
all the sympathy and human understanding-

640
00:36:06,995 --> 00:36:09,730
You don't understand. I'm
just trying to tell you-

641
00:36:09,731 --> 00:36:13,100
I am just like you, really!
I have feelings, too.

642
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:16,103
- If you prick me, do I not bleed?
- Archie!

643
00:36:16,104 --> 00:36:18,773
I've had enough, okay?
Why don't you just get lost?!

644
00:36:18,774 --> 00:36:21,108
Archie, you-

645
00:36:25,246 --> 00:36:27,181
<i>( applause )</i>

646
00:36:27,182 --> 00:36:30,017
Hear, hear.
Easy does it.

647
00:36:30,018 --> 00:36:31,852
<i>Lexie:
Come away in.</i>

648
00:36:31,853 --> 00:36:34,555
<i>The Glenbogle Two become
the Glenbogle Three.</i>

649
00:36:34,556 --> 00:36:36,924
- Hector: There we are.
- Yep.

650
00:36:36,925 --> 00:36:38,926
Good girl. Now, Katrina,
I've just read

651
00:36:38,927 --> 00:36:40,995
<i>A very interesting article
in Country Life</i>

652
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:42,930
About Scottish
land reform.

653
00:36:47,002 --> 00:36:48,969
It's very hypnotic.

654
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,637
And soothing.

655
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,274
Oh, Archie.
I'm not...

656
00:36:54,275 --> 00:36:56,543
I'm not much of a one
for giving advice,

657
00:36:56,544 --> 00:36:58,713
Aside of how
to hold a gun or...

658
00:36:58,714 --> 00:37:00,815
Caress the water
with a fly.

659
00:37:00,816 --> 00:37:02,883
I know nothing
about business,

660
00:37:02,884 --> 00:37:05,485
Nor even about
what people call love.

661
00:37:07,189 --> 00:37:08,555
But...

662
00:37:08,556 --> 00:37:11,525
Only thing I can
say to you is...

663
00:37:11,526 --> 00:37:14,161
Something I've failed
to do all my life.

664
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:18,199
Follow your heart, son.

665
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,267
Follow your heart.

666
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:25,873
It's always the same,
Duncan.

667
00:37:25,874 --> 00:37:29,143
Disappointment.
Disillusion.

668
00:37:29,144 --> 00:37:30,945
Betrayal.

669
00:37:30,946 --> 00:37:34,248
She made toothpicks from
the timbers of my heart.

670
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:36,683
The unchanging pattern
of my life.

671
00:37:36,684 --> 00:37:38,886
That's a country
and western song.

672
00:37:38,887 --> 00:37:40,921
It's in Golly's
collection.

673
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:43,357
I know I'm not good-looking,
I know that.

674
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:45,559
"get your tongue
out of my mouth

675
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,662
'cause I'm kissing you
goodbye. " that's another.

676
00:37:48,663 --> 00:37:50,464
When I was born,

677
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:53,834
I was so ugly the doctor
slapped my mother.

678
00:37:53,835 --> 00:37:55,770
I liked Archie,
you know?

679
00:37:55,771 --> 00:37:58,538
Trusted him, had a
real soft spot for him.

680
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:00,407
I've still got one-

681
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:02,843
In a trench
in the vegetable garden.

682
00:38:02,844 --> 00:38:04,678
All right, lads?

683
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,781
Can I buy you
a drink?

684
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:08,715
<i>Lexie: Nursery food's coming up.</i>

685
00:38:08,716 --> 00:38:10,785
I'll talk to as many
tenants as I can.

686
00:38:10,786 --> 00:38:12,653
Excellent.
What about sandwiches?

687
00:38:12,654 --> 00:38:15,289
Banana and chutney?
Chocks away.

688
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,324
Oh, good!
I do love a 'nana sarnie.

689
00:38:19,294 --> 00:38:20,861
Yes.

690
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:25,065
I need to
get my things.

691
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:27,234
I'll give you a lift
to the station.

692
00:38:27,235 --> 00:38:29,236
No, you-
you won't.

693
00:38:29,237 --> 00:38:31,505
You're as squiffy
as 60 billy goats.

694
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:37,044
<i>Woman:
Thank you, dear.</i>

695
00:38:37,045 --> 00:38:40,614
Spare me the glassy,
meaningless smile of the drunk.

696
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,384
- Marry me.
- What?

697
00:38:44,385 --> 00:38:46,486
It's crazy,
but it might work.

698
00:38:46,487 --> 00:38:48,622
Why would I
marry you, Alan?

699
00:38:48,623 --> 00:38:50,457
Because I'm mad
about you.

700
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,992
Because I love you.

701
00:38:51,993 --> 00:38:54,295
Because I want
to have your babies.

702
00:38:54,296 --> 00:38:56,897
Well, I'm not sure
about that last bit.

703
00:38:56,898 --> 00:38:59,200
I'm sorry, but the answer is no.

704
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:02,569
- Anyway, you're drunk.
- I'm not drunk!

705
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,538
And I meant
what I said.

706
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:07,474
Inside this tough,
manly exterior,

707
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:09,409
My heart is bursting

708
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,578
With an intense
longing for you.

709
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,513
Alan...

710
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:15,482
That's very sweet,

711
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:17,751
And I'm very fond of you,

712
00:39:17,752 --> 00:39:19,820
But I don't love you.

713
00:39:19,821 --> 00:39:22,356
<i>How can I marry you
if I don't love you?</i>

714
00:39:22,357 --> 00:39:25,326
Got the hots for someone else,
is that it?

715
00:39:25,327 --> 00:39:27,761
<i>Your tame aristo?</i>

716
00:39:27,762 --> 00:39:30,364
<i>Oh, aye,
he's such a nice guy.</i>

717
00:39:30,365 --> 00:39:32,933
But I hear
he's reverted to type...

718
00:39:32,934 --> 00:39:35,435
Having his way
with the staff

719
00:39:35,436 --> 00:39:38,672
- Like so many of his forebears.
- Alan.

720
00:39:38,673 --> 00:39:41,075
I don't know what
the radical feminist line is

721
00:39:41,076 --> 00:39:42,943
On that kind of hanky-panky,

722
00:39:42,944 --> 00:39:46,113
But it reeks of the worst kind
of sexual exploitation to me.

723
00:39:46,114 --> 00:39:48,448
Thank you,
but I already knew.

724
00:39:48,449 --> 00:39:50,384
Katrina, you know...

725
00:39:50,385 --> 00:39:52,452
You're one of those women

726
00:39:52,453 --> 00:39:54,788
Who just can't work out
what they want,

727
00:39:54,789 --> 00:39:56,891
But they're
nevertheless prepared

728
00:39:56,892 --> 00:39:59,093
To fight to the death
to get it.

729
00:40:00,295 --> 00:40:01,896
Goodbye, Alan.

730
00:40:05,566 --> 00:40:07,634
( hissing )

731
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,008
Positive reaction.

732
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:15,910
Excellent. Now we can
deal with the money side.

733
00:40:15,911 --> 00:40:18,145
Ahh! Banker chappie.

734
00:40:18,146 --> 00:40:20,981
<i>Duncan, convey the abacus
operative up here, would you?</i>

735
00:40:36,631 --> 00:40:38,299
Justine.

736
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,934
It's me.

737
00:40:39,935 --> 00:40:41,768
Just give it
to me ballpark.

738
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:43,637
- There he is!
- I'll call you back.

739
00:40:43,638 --> 00:40:45,439
- Turncoat!
- Perfidy in human form.

740
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,274
- Unclean.
- Archie out!

741
00:40:47,275 --> 00:40:49,576
( chanting )
Archie out! Archie out!

742
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:51,078
Archie out! Archie out!

743
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:53,513
<i>Archie yelling:
Come on, just be quiet!</i>

744
00:40:53,514 --> 00:40:55,449
Would you all
come down, please?

745
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,284
I have a few things
to say to you.

746
00:41:02,723 --> 00:41:04,758
Hector,
what's going on?

747
00:41:04,759 --> 00:41:07,328
<i>- These men- - I thought
you weren't speaking to me?</i>

748
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:09,529
Don't worry,
Golly will deal with them,

749
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,998
My heart's desire.

750
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:18,839
Well...

751
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,774
We await
his master's voice.

752
00:41:24,245 --> 00:41:26,146
Right.

753
00:41:26,147 --> 00:41:28,349
Since I came back
to Glenbogle

754
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,617
A couple
of centuries ago,

755
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:33,320
I seem, at various times,
to have angered,

756
00:41:33,321 --> 00:41:36,323
<i>Irritated, disappointed,
and hurt some,</i>

757
00:41:36,324 --> 00:41:38,425
<i>Most, maybe even
all of you.</i>

758
00:41:40,428 --> 00:41:42,596
I'd especially like
to apologize to you, Lexie.

759
00:41:42,597 --> 00:41:46,133
<i>I'm mortified at the thought
that I might have hurt you,</i>

760
00:41:46,134 --> 00:41:48,335
Because over the past
few weeks and months,

761
00:41:48,336 --> 00:41:50,704
I've come to see just what
a special girl you are.

762
00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:52,973
Thanks, Arch.

763
00:41:52,974 --> 00:41:55,976
And before anyone else does
a simple sum with that sentence

764
00:41:55,977 --> 00:41:59,079
And comes up with a figure
approaching the size of our overdraft,

765
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,716
Let me say that nothing has happened
between us that I'm ashamed of

766
00:42:02,717 --> 00:42:05,719
<i>Or that warrants
any explanation to anyone.</i>

767
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,922
<i>Katrina, I'd like to thank you
for your unwavering help,</i>

768
00:42:08,923 --> 00:42:11,358
<i>Especially your
fascinating lectures</i>

769
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,827
On the major political issues
of the day.

770
00:42:13,828 --> 00:42:16,363
I'm sorry if I haven't always
seemed grateful but-

771
00:42:16,364 --> 00:42:19,766
You know what they say, "asking a
voter what he thinks about politicians

772
00:42:19,767 --> 00:42:22,636
Is a bit like asking lampposts
what they think about dogs. "

773
00:42:22,637 --> 00:42:25,105
( chuckles )
nice one, Archie.

774
00:42:25,106 --> 00:42:28,742
I hope I'll always have your
support, maybe even your respect,

775
00:42:28,743 --> 00:42:32,712
<i>Despite my status
as resident feudal relic</i>

776
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:35,416
<i>And pet punch bag.</i>

777
00:42:35,417 --> 00:42:39,853
Maybe the fact that I'm not selling
out to Kilwillie will be a start.

778
00:42:39,854 --> 00:42:41,888
What are you
going to do?

779
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:44,124
<i>Mother, father,</i>

780
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:46,226
<i>I've just spoken
to Justine,</i>

781
00:42:46,227 --> 00:42:49,329
And I've accepted her offer
for my share of the restaurant,

782
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,666
<i>- I'll use the money to pay
for the underpinning- - but-</i>

783
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:55,202
<i>And start repaying
the debt to the bank.</i>

784
00:42:55,203 --> 00:42:58,439
That way we can all get on with
the job of making Glenbogle viable,

785
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,375
Giving it,
and us, a future.

786
00:43:01,376 --> 00:43:03,143
That's my boy.

787
00:43:03,144 --> 00:43:05,079
Archie, darling,
are you sure?

788
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,780
<i>Not really, no.</i>

789
00:43:06,781 --> 00:43:08,282
But, um...

790
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,885
<i>It just seemed right.</i>

791
00:43:11,886 --> 00:43:14,821
But whatever happens,
I'm gonna make a go of it,

792
00:43:14,822 --> 00:43:16,957
And I hope
you'll all help me.

793
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:19,226
And I hope you'll all
be my friends.

794
00:43:19,227 --> 00:43:21,595
Well said.
Damn well said.

795
00:43:26,701 --> 00:43:28,969
You don't have
to blow your money,

796
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,472
And you don't have to sell out
to Kilwillie either.

797
00:43:31,473 --> 00:43:35,375
You could make a lot of people
very happy instead.

798
00:43:35,376 --> 00:43:38,178
<i>- How do you mean?
- We've hatched a plan.</i>

799
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:39,980
All of us.

800
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:42,182
You can sell the properties
in the village

801
00:43:42,183 --> 00:43:44,451
<i>- To the tenants.
- Tenants?</i>

802
00:43:44,452 --> 00:43:47,521
- Could they afford it?
- They can get help from the government

803
00:43:47,522 --> 00:43:49,623
Under the new
land legislation.

804
00:43:49,624 --> 00:43:52,159
And we've lined up
mortgages already.

805
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,695
- Fleming?
- It'll help the bank get its money back.

806
00:43:55,696 --> 00:43:58,132
It's the perfect solution
for everybody,

807
00:43:58,133 --> 00:44:00,400
And it's good
for the community.

808
00:44:00,401 --> 00:44:02,269
And good for the estate.

809
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,171
And for you, Archie.

810
00:44:04,172 --> 00:44:07,207
And it keeps
your options open...

811
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:09,042
With Justine.

812
00:44:10,612 --> 00:44:14,014
- Everybody's happy.
- Apart from Kilwillie.

813
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,052
By the way, this was
all your father's idea.

814
00:44:19,053 --> 00:44:21,021
You?

815
00:44:21,022 --> 00:44:23,624
It's what I keep
telling you, Archie.

816
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:26,960
One simply must move
with the times.

817
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,601
<i>Hector:
This way, everybody.</i>

818
00:44:36,837 --> 00:44:39,206
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask
you to charge your glasses.

819
00:44:39,207 --> 00:44:41,808
I'd like to
propose a toast.

820
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:43,910
To the loveliest girl
in the Highlands...

821
00:44:43,911 --> 00:44:46,713
My dear wife
of 40 years...

822
00:44:46,714 --> 00:44:48,182
To Molly.

823
00:44:48,183 --> 00:44:49,916
All:
To Molly.

824
00:44:53,288 --> 00:44:55,055
Thank you,
Duncan.

825
00:44:55,056 --> 00:44:57,057
Gentlemen!
Do your worst!

826
00:44:59,727 --> 00:45:01,662
( oohing and ahhing )

827
00:45:09,737 --> 00:45:12,772
<i>- Molly: Ahh!
- Hector: Happy, darling?</i>

828
00:45:19,247 --> 00:45:22,349
<i>- Isn't it lovely?
- Ah, yes. Wonderful.</i>

829
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,884
<i>- Oh.
- Thank you, Golly.</i>

830
00:45:24,885 --> 00:45:27,787
Happy anniversary,
you sentimental old fool.

831
00:45:27,788 --> 00:45:29,789
I wanted
to buy you a ruby

832
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:31,758
But the fireworks
were cheaper.

833
00:45:37,765 --> 00:45:39,533
Splendid.

834
00:45:47,742 --> 00:45:50,744
Well-
Archie MacDonald,

835
00:45:50,745 --> 00:45:53,247
Thank you very much
for your kind words.

836
00:45:53,248 --> 00:45:55,749
Oh, I meant them.

837
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,584
You haven't
really fallen

838
00:45:57,585 --> 00:46:00,254
For this miserable specimen
before you, have you?

839
00:46:00,255 --> 00:46:02,356
What, me? You?

840
00:46:02,357 --> 00:46:04,258
Don't be daft.

841
00:46:04,259 --> 00:46:06,460
Who do you think I am?

842
00:46:06,461 --> 00:46:07,728
But-

843
00:46:07,729 --> 00:46:10,029
I will tell you this,
Archie MacDonald,

844
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,165
One of these fine days
me and you

845
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:14,067
Are gonna finish
what we started.

846
00:46:18,172 --> 00:46:20,206
All right.
Come on, boys,

847
00:46:20,207 --> 00:46:22,142
Let's party.

848
00:46:22,143 --> 00:46:24,043
And no fighting.

849
00:46:24,044 --> 00:46:25,646
Here you are.

850
00:46:27,315 --> 00:46:29,549
You have to come down
to the village tomorrow.

851
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,718
I think your
soon-to-be ex-tenants

852
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:35,322
<i>Would like to thank you in
person. Mrs. Mcleod actually said</i>

853
00:46:35,323 --> 00:46:37,724
She was sorry to be
getting her own place.

854
00:46:37,725 --> 00:46:41,495
"Lairds have been looking after
my families for centuries. "

855
00:46:41,496 --> 00:46:43,963
- She was nearly crying.
- How sweet.

856
00:46:43,964 --> 00:46:46,366
<i>Demeaning, more like.
In the new Scotland-</i>

857
00:46:46,367 --> 00:46:48,769
Katrina, put another
record on, will you?

858
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:52,038
I've heard this one so many
times I could sing it myself.

00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:54,874
- Listen here, matey-
- no, you listen.

860
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:57,010
I wanna thank you
for what you did,

861
00:46:57,011 --> 00:46:59,379
For me and Justine.

862
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,515
It was very generous of you.

863
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:05,352
I suppose, in a way, the other
way would have been easier.

864
00:47:05,353 --> 00:47:09,255
The decision was made for me. Burn
my boats in London and settle here.

865
00:47:09,256 --> 00:47:12,192
But now I have to
decide for myself.

866
00:47:14,362 --> 00:47:16,996
What to do about
me and Justine...

867
00:47:16,997 --> 00:47:19,333
What to do
about me and you.

868
00:47:21,502 --> 00:47:23,704
Oh?

869
00:47:23,705 --> 00:47:26,039
Is there such a thing
as me and you?

871
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:36,817
<i>- ( car door closes )
- Archie: Justine.</i>

872
00:47:46,461 --> 00:47:48,362
<i>I had to come.</i>

873
00:47:48,363 --> 00:47:50,930
I felt so desolate.

874
00:47:52,066 --> 00:47:54,000
I can't lose you,
Archie.

875
00:47:55,269 --> 00:47:57,270
Maybe I can change.

876
00:47:57,271 --> 00:48:00,741
Maybe I can come
and live here...

877
00:48:00,742 --> 00:48:02,409
With you.

878
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,310
<i>Make our lives here.</i>

879
00:48:05,813 --> 00:48:07,848
What do you think?

880
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:25,766
