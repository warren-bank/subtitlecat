1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,569
Hello.

2
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,571
Come here.

3
00:00:26,913 --> 00:00:29,415
<i>What's his name?</i>

4
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,983
Useless.

5
00:00:31,984 --> 00:00:33,919
Aw, who called him that?

6
00:00:41,928 --> 00:00:44,296
<i>What are you going to
tell your mother about me?</i>

7
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:47,065
Nothing.

8
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:49,735
What about us?

9
00:00:50,937 --> 00:00:53,305
<i>What would Hector
have wanted?</i>

10
00:00:53,306 --> 00:00:55,807
My father is dead.

11
00:01:03,717 --> 00:01:05,751
<i>( Useless whining )</i>

12
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:13,959
Useless!

13
00:01:15,428 --> 00:01:17,629
<i>( barking )</i>

14
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,698
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

15
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:57,702
You can't just send
him away.

16
00:01:57,703 --> 00:01:59,671
I just did.

17
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,775
- Archie: Morning all.
- All: Morning.

18
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:05,944
Tea? Coffee?

19
00:02:05,945 --> 00:02:07,979
That is so kind.

20
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,283
Well, Lexie, last night was wonderful.

21
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:12,951
Everything
was perfect.

22
00:02:12,952 --> 00:02:16,721
<i>- Almost perfect.
- Golly: it was a triumph, lass.</i>

23
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:19,291
Duncan: The whole day went
off pretty well, eh, Arch?

24
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:21,460
<i>- Hmm?
- you know, Big Eric</i>

25
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:24,696
being... exactly
where I said he'd be.

26
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:26,331
<i>We're a good team.</i>

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,903
I think I'll have a quiet day,
contemplating a life of leisure,

28
00:02:31,904 --> 00:02:33,605
now that we have a new

29
00:02:33,606 --> 00:02:35,940
and very capable
Lady of Glenbogle.

30
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:39,478
- I've got a lot to learn.
- So have I.

31
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:42,214
Still, I hope life will
still spring a few surprises.

32
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:44,382
Coffee, mother?

33
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:46,284
<i>Thank you.</i>

34
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:48,886
Do you know, I'd love
to travel again.

35
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:52,056
Why would you do that? Why
would anyone want to leave here?

36
00:02:52,057 --> 00:02:55,360
Well, a man has to settle
sometime, somewhere.

37
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:59,697
It sounds suspiciously
like pipe and slippers to me.

38
00:02:59,698 --> 00:03:01,766
You're much too young
for that.

39
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:07,105
Oh, look, there's Useless with
that young man from last night.

40
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:10,375
<i>Lexie:
Oh, so it is.</i>

41
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:11,976
Excuse me.

42
00:03:11,977 --> 00:03:14,579
Would you like some
more coffee, Molly?

43
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:19,083
I couldn't shake him, he's
taken a real shine to me.

44
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:22,220
- What do you want from us?
- I came to return your dog.

45
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:24,656
A word of thanks
might be a start.

46
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,593
Thank you.

47
00:03:28,594 --> 00:03:31,163
- Now please-
- what? Get off my land?

48
00:03:31,164 --> 00:03:33,598
You have no right
to wreck my mother's life.

49
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,634
<i>Oh, that's rich.
What about my mother?</i>

50
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:37,802
Her life? who do you
think wrecked that?

51
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:39,837
Let's not start
a slagging match here.

52
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:42,974
I'm sorry, but that's in the past
and that's where it should stay.

53
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:45,577
It does affect all of
us, especially Molly.

54
00:03:45,578 --> 00:03:48,513
- Somebody mention me?
- It's nothing, mother.

55
00:03:48,514 --> 00:03:51,349
What affects
especially me?

56
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:55,587
Hector's son. But that
makes Molly his mom.

57
00:03:55,588 --> 00:03:58,089
Molly is not Paul's mother, Duncan.

58
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,160
Hector MacDonald,

59
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:04,596
you dirty dog.

60
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:11,769
- Morning, Kilwillie.
- I'm looking for Archie.

61
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,805
Belated gift for the intended honeymoon.

62
00:04:13,806 --> 00:04:16,808
- Rather generous. - Two
round-the-world air tickets, first class.

63
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:20,378
- That's slightly more than rather, old boy.
- Molly will be very impressed.

64
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:23,047
That never
crossed my mind!

65
00:04:23,048 --> 00:04:25,016
( shudders )

66
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:26,818
You didn't know Hector
like I did.

67
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:29,854
Do you think he could have kept
this from me for what, 30 years?

68
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:32,691
Longer.
I was born in '66.

69
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,930
You and countless others.

70
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:41,633
You'll be blaming him
for all of them next.

71
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:45,103
I'm not blaming anyone.

72
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:48,240
Excuse me, I've got
a thousand things to do.

73
00:04:55,914 --> 00:04:58,216
Paul-

74
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:05,790
<i>- Molly, I think you'll be
pleased- - Not now, Kilwillie.</i>

75
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,192
<i>- Oh, I say, Archie-
- later, Kilwillie.</i>

76
00:05:08,193 --> 00:05:11,129
- Lexie?
- A wee bit busy, Kilwillie.

77
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,434
Is he telling the truth?

78
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:18,570
There's a letter from
the estate's solicitors.

79
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:20,338
I'm afraid there's
very little doubt.

80
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:23,040
These things happen.
Well, heaven knows,

81
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,176
Hector was no saint.

82
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:28,413
He made a mistake,
end of story.

83
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:31,683
- Is there anything I can do?
- No. thank you.

84
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:36,721
I told him what this
would do to her.

85
00:05:36,722 --> 00:05:39,291
- Archie, don't-
- he had no right to come here.

86
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:04,515
Maybe you could try
showing a bit of leg.

87
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,420
I brought your mate.

88
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:16,461
Come on, at least
hear me out.

89
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:18,730
Right, you started this

90
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:21,266
so you're going to listen to
me whether you like it or not.

91
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:34,545
Paul: He asked me to leave.
How clear do you need it?

92
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:37,682
You have dropped a bit of
a bombshell around here.

93
00:06:37,683 --> 00:06:41,119
The dust will settle and you can
all get back to what you're best at.

94
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,588
Which is?

95
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:47,225
Keeping your precious acres
free from the common herd.

96
00:06:47,226 --> 00:06:49,727
Listen, pal, I'm just
as common as you are

97
00:06:49,728 --> 00:06:51,796
so don't come
the underdog with me.

98
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:54,465
You married well.

99
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:58,669
I married the man
that I love,

100
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,472
and believe me,
he is worth the effort.

101
00:07:04,643 --> 00:07:07,412
I hoped he and I could
get to know each other.

102
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:11,116
<i>- It takes time.
- I haven't got time.</i>

103
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:13,118
A couple of days at most.

104
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:15,653
I doubt the ice
will thaw that quickly.

105
00:07:15,654 --> 00:07:18,189
It's worth a try.

106
00:07:20,426 --> 00:07:22,794
A letter, your lordship,
a letter.

107
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:25,297
- Very far from unusual.
- This one is, sir,

108
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:28,866
for this one bears
the royal seal.

109
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:31,636
I've been out looking
high and low.

110
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:34,973
I guessed you'd gone courting
with Mrs. MacDonald again.

111
00:07:34,974 --> 00:07:37,943
No, no, I was just
looking for Archie-

112
00:07:37,944 --> 00:07:40,111
good lord!

113
00:07:40,112 --> 00:07:42,113
Bad news,
your lordship?

114
00:07:42,114 --> 00:07:43,781
<i>Au contraire.</i>

115
00:07:43,782 --> 00:07:46,717
Kilwillie Spring Water
has been selected

116
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:48,786
for the royal table.

117
00:07:48,787 --> 00:07:50,355
Is that all, sir?

118
00:07:50,356 --> 00:07:53,124
Bested in courtship, second
in Molly's affections,

119
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,727
yet my foot is on the silken ladder
leading to the ultimate prize.

120
00:07:56,728 --> 00:08:01,499
Kilwillie, by royal
appointment. hah!

121
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:05,437
<i>( car doors slamming )</i>

122
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:12,477
Does Archie know
about this?

123
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,213
No, not yet.

124
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:18,916
He's come a long way
to find us

125
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:22,387
<i>- and doesn't have much time.
- I'm not going behind Archie's back.</i>

126
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:25,556
You take care of Paul,
I'll talk to Archie.

127
00:08:25,557 --> 00:08:27,459
See if I can
bring him round.

128
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,495
What about Molly? Is this not
rubbing her nose in it a wee bit?

129
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:32,998
No, it's helping her
face the truth, Golly.

130
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:36,001
You might come to regret
starting this, lass.

131
00:08:36,002 --> 00:08:38,036
<i>I didn't start anything.</i>

132
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:41,906
Look, he's here, he's more
of a MacDonald than I am.

133
00:08:41,907 --> 00:08:43,741
I know that.

134
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:47,112
So, do you not think he deserves
to know something about his roots?

135
00:08:52,151 --> 00:08:54,519
Archie has to know, mind.

136
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:06,398
I mean, he doesn't take
a scrap of notice of me.

137
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,599
I may as well be
part of the furniture.

138
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:13,271
Archie has got a lot
on his mind, son.

139
00:09:14,473 --> 00:09:16,774
He doesn't mean
to seem ungrateful.

140
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:19,244
I mean, like yesterday.
If it wasn't for me,

141
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:21,746
Big Eric would still be
staggering around out there.

142
00:09:21,747 --> 00:09:23,548
I told you
you did a good job.

143
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:26,751
Yeah, I know, but a pat on the
back from Archie wouldn't go amiss.

144
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:29,987
It's my own fault,
of course.

145
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:32,390
Well, I don't push
myself forward.

146
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:35,326
<i>I'm always in the background
being good old Dunc.</i>

147
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:37,128
Well, do it,
assert yourself.

148
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:39,697
Why? no one would
take any notice.

149
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,337
Can you hear anything?

150
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:47,838
No.

151
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,774
No, neither can I.

152
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:53,644
<i>- ( rock thuds )
- Dry as a bone.</i>

153
00:09:59,952 --> 00:10:01,819
The brochures came.

154
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,190
I know, everywhere we
talked about is so expensive.

155
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:07,325
We got married
economy class.

156
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:10,027
I want our honeymoon to be
something really special,

157
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:13,064
something to look back on
when the house is overrun

158
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:15,800
with little people.

159
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:17,902
Don't jump
the gun, you.

160
00:10:17,903 --> 00:10:22,240
Anyway, all I need
is for you to be there.

161
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:24,976
That makes it special.

162
00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:27,345
Well, that
and the hot sun

163
00:10:27,346 --> 00:10:29,514
and the golden beaches.

164
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:34,819
How much do
you love me?

165
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:39,324
Oh, about that much.

166
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:41,593
A lot.

167
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:44,929
Good, because
you'll need to.

168
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:50,235
- Paul's back.
- You've seen him?

169
00:10:50,236 --> 00:10:54,071
- No, I brought him.
- What?

170
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:57,742
He's Hector's son. You can't
pretend he doesn't exist.

171
00:10:57,743 --> 00:10:59,877
- Where is he?
- Just hear me out.

172
00:10:59,878 --> 00:11:02,947
<i>- Where is he?
- Paul is part of this family.</i>

173
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:05,383
Okay? you can't
just send him away.

174
00:11:05,384 --> 00:11:07,318
For Molly's sake,

175
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:10,488
<i>as long as Paul's a stranger
to her then Hector will be too.</i>

176
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:12,990
- She loved my father.
- And he betrayed her.

177
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:15,360
If he was alive today,
she would rant and rave

178
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:17,262
but eventually
she would forgive him.

179
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:21,232
- I doubt it.
- Paul is a living reminder of Hector,

180
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:24,869
<i>- just like you are.
- You are wrong to interfere.</i>

181
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,373
Archie, this gives me
the right to interfere.

182
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:31,342
I am part of this family.
Paul is too.

183
00:11:31,343 --> 00:11:33,178
Where is he?

184
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,348
You tell me
where he is.

185
00:11:39,084 --> 00:11:41,185
I'll take no time
to dig a trench.

186
00:11:41,186 --> 00:11:44,622
Yeah, so long as he
comes up with the idea.

187
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:50,261
Duncan, Paul was
just reminding me,

188
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:52,864
there's the burn
not 50 yards away.

189
00:11:52,865 --> 00:11:55,934
What do you think?
Have you any ideas?

190
00:11:58,003 --> 00:12:00,538
It's a fair way
to move a house, Golly.

191
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:03,441
So, maybe we could...?

192
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:07,445
- Buy a bucket?
- Buy a bucket, or...?

193
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:10,381
Hey, we could
dig a trench.

194
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:14,051
- Great idea, mate.
- Excellent.

195
00:12:24,763 --> 00:12:26,998
Badger!

196
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:39,477
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

197
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:43,147
I wish you could talk
to me about this.

198
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:45,282
Why? it's the past.

199
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:47,986
Live for today, look
forward to tomorrow.

200
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:49,954
Yeah, but something
as big as this, Molly.

201
00:12:51,724 --> 00:12:55,860
Hector had a fling, there
was a child, that's it.

202
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,463
If you want
to talk to him...

203
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:03,735
- To whom?
- Paul.

204
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:05,537
It's not too late.

205
00:13:05,538 --> 00:13:07,705
Why on earth should
I want to do that?

206
00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:12,644
Where is he? What are
you playing at, Golly?

207
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:14,612
I don't believe
he means any harm.

208
00:13:14,613 --> 00:13:17,815
He's done enough. I don't want
him running into my mother again.

209
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:19,884
Look, I'm concerned
about Molly, too,

210
00:13:19,885 --> 00:13:21,786
but the lad has
rights as well.

211
00:13:21,787 --> 00:13:24,288
- Does he?
- Yes, he does, Archie, and so do I.

212
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:27,425
A lot of this is my fault. I
have some amends to make here.

213
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:32,864
Archie, that fellow

214
00:13:32,865 --> 00:13:35,767
<i>is attempting to steal
my commercial assets.</i>

215
00:13:35,768 --> 00:13:38,636
We were looking for a source
of water for the house.

216
00:13:38,637 --> 00:13:40,705
- What's wrong with the well?
- It's dry.

217
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:45,109
- It was okay last year.
- Underground springs run to their own plans, not ours.

218
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,344
He can't live here
without water.

219
00:13:47,345 --> 00:13:49,547
He'll have
to live without mine.

220
00:13:49,548 --> 00:13:53,685
I don't know if you've noticed, but it
falls from the sky on a pretty regular basis.

221
00:13:53,686 --> 00:13:56,253
Yes, and what falls
on my land is my own.

222
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:57,689
Archie.

223
00:13:59,391 --> 00:14:02,359
I don't want to fall out with
you over this, but dash it all,

224
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,428
my water's about to
furnish the royal table.

225
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:07,765
I can't have it used by every Tom,
Dick and Golly for their ablutions.

226
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:10,167
That is both petty
and insulting.

227
00:14:10,168 --> 00:14:13,270
Petty?
Archibald MacDonald,

228
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:17,241
consider our two great and
ancient houses in dispute.

229
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:19,243
Okay.

230
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:21,212
Oh.

231
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:22,647
Badger.

232
00:14:22,648 --> 00:14:24,582
Do you see the trouble
he's caused?

233
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,851
You shouldn't have
got involved, Golly.

234
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:29,988
Don't take it out on him. It's
me you should be talking to.

235
00:14:29,989 --> 00:14:32,890
I have nothing to say to you
that I haven't said already.

236
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:34,926
Lads, lads!

237
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,397
This is not
like you, Archie.

238
00:14:40,398 --> 00:14:42,934
I want him
away from here.

239
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:47,438
No, son, this is my home,
he is my guest.

240
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:49,273
Right.

241
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:51,208
It's on your head.

242
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:52,810
What about Kilwillie?

243
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:55,680
He is the least of my problems
right now. You deal with it.

244
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:11,495
<i>- ( knocking )
- Come in.</i>

245
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:14,732
- Andrew: I hope this isn't a bad time.
- Not at all.

246
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:17,735
Do sit down.

247
00:15:17,736 --> 00:15:20,104
You've no shortage
of bedtime reading.

248
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:23,507
Do you know how few
I've actually read?

249
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:26,811
They're just a silent
reminder of how little I know.

250
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,915
But we learn through living, don't we?

251
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:35,019
I admit, I've been a bit
overzealous in that regard.

252
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,222
Bet you wouldn't
change a day of it.

253
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:41,025
Maybe the odd day. But,
whether it's my age,

254
00:15:41,026 --> 00:15:43,661
or maybe
it's this place,

255
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:46,263
but I'm ready
to change, Molly.

256
00:15:46,264 --> 00:15:49,300
Don't change too much, you'll
completely lose your mystery.

257
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:52,870
I don't want to be a mystery
- I want to be a very good neighbor,

258
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:54,939
and a good friend.

259
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,974
Another Glenbogle
casualty.

260
00:15:56,975 --> 00:15:59,443
People come here and lose
the will to leave.

261
00:15:59,444 --> 00:16:00,912
Why leave-

262
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:02,880
when everything
you want is here?

263
00:16:04,717 --> 00:16:07,118
You and your husband
were very lucky.

264
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:10,521
My husband.

265
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:13,424
Yes.

266
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:15,226
Actually...

267
00:16:15,227 --> 00:16:19,330
there is something that you could
do for me, if you'd be so kind.

268
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:22,967
<i>Kilwillie: Kilwillie Spring Water
will be the most sought-after,</i>

269
00:16:22,968 --> 00:16:24,702
the most exclusive,

270
00:16:24,703 --> 00:16:26,904
the most hideously
expensive manifestation

271
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:29,607
of god's great bounty
that ever fell upon our heads.

272
00:16:29,608 --> 00:16:33,244
<i>Your mission is to guard
every drop and trickle</i>

273
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:35,980
<i>of this priceless
commodity.</i>

274
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:38,482
Never in the history
of bottled water

275
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:41,819
has so much depended
on so few.

276
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:45,790
Carry on.

277
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,292
Seems Mrs. MacDonald

278
00:16:48,293 --> 00:16:51,195
has finally
passed him over.

279
00:16:52,298 --> 00:16:54,765
It still
looks good to me.

280
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:58,135
Disciplined drawing,
deft brushwork

281
00:16:58,136 --> 00:17:00,137
<i>and a pretty sound
composition.</i>

282
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:03,140
But I completely failed to
capture the character within.

283
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:05,910
- Where's it go?
- This way.

284
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:15,486
- Mother?
- Keep going.

285
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:20,525
Can I have a word?

286
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:22,893
In here.

287
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:31,969
Golly needs your support.

288
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,971
<i>Don't abandon him
because of me.</i>

289
00:17:33,972 --> 00:17:35,940
I can't keep you
out of Golly's house

290
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:39,043
- but I can, and I will, keep you out of mine.
- Why?

291
00:17:39,044 --> 00:17:42,179
<i>- Have you seen my mother?
- this isn't about your mother.</i>

292
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,649
<i>- Her feelings aren't important?
- of course they are.</i>

293
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,017
She'll deal with this her
own way, like we have to do.

294
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:49,387
<i>I don't want this any
more than you, Archie,</i>

295
00:17:49,388 --> 00:17:51,856
but we are brothers,
that is a reality.

296
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:04,502
- ( Archie sighs )
- Paul's right.

297
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:08,706
<i>There is more to this
than just Molly's feelings.</i>

298
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:13,645
First Golly, now you, why can't we
just focus on what's best for mother?

299
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:17,448
Why can't we just think about
what's best for all of us, Arch?

300
00:18:17,449 --> 00:18:20,418
Well, we'd better start
by canceling the honeymoon.

301
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:22,119
What?

302
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,089
I can't leave here with him
around and my mother like that.

303
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,165
This place rules
our lives, doesn't it?

304
00:18:39,037 --> 00:18:42,106
Glenbogle has
to come first.

305
00:18:42,107 --> 00:18:44,375
We're just
caretakers, Lex.

306
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:47,244
We don't own it,
it owns us.

307
00:18:56,288 --> 00:18:58,088
Badger,

308
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:00,024
some tins
from the pantry.

309
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:04,128
Oh, artichoke hearts,
gentlemen's relish

310
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:08,165
and shoe polish.
Thank you, your lordship.

311
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,168
Did you happen
to bring a tin opener?

312
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:13,404
I thought butlers
had those.

313
00:19:13,405 --> 00:19:15,940
Oh, right enough,
your lordship.

314
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:18,876
I'll collect these tomorrow
morning when I bring the silver.

315
00:19:18,877 --> 00:19:20,611
Very good,
your lordship.

316
00:19:33,392 --> 00:19:35,460
Molly,

317
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:37,462
what have you
done with it?

318
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:39,764
Oh, that-

319
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:41,532
it's where it belongs.

320
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:45,202
And before you say anything,
the answer is definitely no.

321
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:48,038
<i>- Really?
- nothing to do with Hector.</i>

322
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:51,676
It was a poor painting and I've been
meaning to take it down for some time.

323
00:19:51,677 --> 00:19:54,579
<i>- I thought it was a good painting.
- No, it wasn't.</i>

324
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,313
After all,
I should know,

325
00:19:56,314 --> 00:19:58,916
I studied at the slade
before I came here.

326
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:01,586
You don't regret that,
though, do you?

327
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:04,655
Heavens no, being
the Lady of Glenbogle

328
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:07,124
in this beautiful,
isolated place

329
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,427
and all those wonderful
years with Hector,

330
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:11,396
of course I don't
regret it.

331
00:20:12,564 --> 00:20:15,232
Whatever you
might think, son,

332
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:17,334
no man gives up
his own child

333
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:19,370
without a great deal
of pain.

334
00:20:20,906 --> 00:20:23,741
Sounds like experience.

335
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:25,543
It's my daughter.

336
00:20:25,544 --> 00:20:27,111
I've seen her since.

337
00:20:27,112 --> 00:20:30,080
How did that feel?

338
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:32,249
Like looking
in a mirror.

339
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,852
She was
a stranger to me,

340
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:37,555
but I knew her
like my own hand.

341
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:42,493
Can't believe Hector
lost any sleep over me.

342
00:20:42,494 --> 00:20:44,462
Oh, he did, he did.

343
00:20:45,731 --> 00:20:47,998
Many a time there'd
be a knock on my door

344
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,334
in the middle of the
night, here he'd be,

345
00:20:50,335 --> 00:20:52,303
bottle of malt
in his hand.

346
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:56,874
What did he talk about?

347
00:20:58,477 --> 00:21:01,011
What it would be like if he
met you, what you looked like.

348
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:03,180
<i>How you were getting on.</i>

349
00:21:04,716 --> 00:21:07,785
Caused me a few sleepless
nights, too, I can tell you.

350
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:10,588
Not to mention some
pretty ferocious hangovers.

351
00:21:13,826 --> 00:21:16,727
- I've been thinking.
- And?

352
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:19,964
And I don't think we should
let Kilwillie call the shots.

353
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:22,633
I think we should
strike back tomorrow.

354
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,508
<i>Lexie: I just can't get through to her.</i>

355
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:06,777
<i>- I've tried but-
- ( door opening )</i>

356
00:22:06,778 --> 00:22:10,647
<i>- Morning, mother.
- Kedgeree for breakfast, Molly, your favorite.</i>

357
00:22:10,648 --> 00:22:13,150
No time, dear,
I must pack.

358
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:14,685
<i>What do you mean,
pack?</i>

359
00:22:14,686 --> 00:22:16,653
I'm leaving.

360
00:22:16,654 --> 00:22:20,224
<i>- What, for a holiday?
- No, just leaving.</i>

361
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,164
I'll go.

362
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:35,106
- Oh, give me a hand.
- You cannot just up and leave.

363
00:22:35,107 --> 00:22:38,609
My mind is made up.
Don't try and stop me.

364
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,278
Let's talk about it.

365
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:42,914
I'll keep in touch, of course.
let you know where I am.

366
00:22:42,915 --> 00:22:45,783
- I promise you, he won't come here again.
- Who won't?

367
00:22:45,784 --> 00:22:49,653
<i>- Paul, I'll get rid of him.
- Archie, please.</i>

368
00:22:53,825 --> 00:22:56,660
- Badger?
- Yes?

369
00:22:56,661 --> 00:22:58,429
I claim this land

370
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,664
in the name of the Glenbogle estate.

371
00:23:00,665 --> 00:23:02,733
I see.

372
00:23:03,802 --> 00:23:05,702
Aye, right, well,

373
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:08,872
surrender now and
no one need get hurt.

374
00:23:08,873 --> 00:23:12,043
Technically, it's not
mine to surrender.

375
00:23:12,044 --> 00:23:14,278
Now, shall I pour
us some tea,

376
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:15,813
whilst you
think on that?

377
00:23:15,814 --> 00:23:19,083
Aye, pour us some tea.

378
00:23:19,084 --> 00:23:22,019
Good lord!

379
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,121
Tea with the enemy?

380
00:23:24,122 --> 00:23:26,757
He's just following
my orders.

381
00:23:26,758 --> 00:23:29,526
<i>- You orders?
- Aye.</i>

382
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:32,463
Maybe now you'll
listen to our demands.

383
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:35,899
I'll be negotiating with Archie.
I only talk to the organ-grinder.

384
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,102
Pompous ass.

385
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:44,608
<i>He had the sheer affrontery
to call me pompous.</i>

386
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:46,543
Good lord.

387
00:23:46,544 --> 00:23:48,512
I take it he'll
be disciplined.

388
00:23:48,513 --> 00:23:51,382
<i>- It's out of my hands.
- he's in your employ.</i>

389
00:23:51,383 --> 00:23:54,185
- No.
- Then what is he doing here?

390
00:23:55,454 --> 00:23:58,222
He's my father's son.

391
00:23:58,223 --> 00:24:01,192
Well, then he ought
to know better. What?!

392
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:04,795
He's Hector's son, he turned
up a couple of days ago.

393
00:24:04,796 --> 00:24:07,931
Good god.

394
00:24:07,932 --> 00:24:11,902
So you can see how your waterworks aren't
exactly top of my agenda at the moment.

395
00:24:11,903 --> 00:24:13,504
Hector?

396
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:16,540
Does Molly know?

397
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:19,443
- Mm-hmm.
- And?

398
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:22,046
She's leaving.

399
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:28,419
- Good morning.
- Morning.

400
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,022
We'd like to speak to
Sergeant Bowman, please.

401
00:24:31,023 --> 00:24:33,090
Paul Bowman?

402
00:24:33,091 --> 00:24:35,493
He's left this
as a contact address.

403
00:24:35,494 --> 00:24:38,595
- Ah-ha.
- So, he's here?

404
00:24:38,596 --> 00:24:41,932
Yes, yes he was.

405
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:45,236
He dropped in just to say
hello, but he's gone now.

406
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:52,009
<i>Golly: Is there something
you're not telling us?</i>

407
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:56,013
Technically, I should
be in barracks.

408
00:24:56,014 --> 00:24:58,982
You mean
you're AWOL?

409
00:24:58,983 --> 00:25:01,818
<i>I had compassionate leave,
of course, when mom was ill.</i>

410
00:25:02,954 --> 00:25:04,788
And for the funeral.

411
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,858
So you haven't
been back since?

412
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:10,394
There was a posting
waiting for me in Cyprus.

413
00:25:10,395 --> 00:25:13,797
But with mom gone and the
house and everything...

414
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:16,100
<i>I've done a lot
of overseas tours,</i>

415
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:20,237
but I've always had somewhere
to come back to. Somewhere I'm-

416
00:25:20,238 --> 00:25:23,674
you know, home.

417
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:28,245
Is there something
we can do?

418
00:25:28,246 --> 00:25:30,013
<i>I've caused enough
trouble already.</i>

419
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:32,049
Time I was on my way.

420
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,718
Is this a court-martial
job, son?

421
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,589
Yeah. but if I'd
found my father

422
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,724
it would have
been worth it.

423
00:25:40,725 --> 00:25:44,661
What about going back,
facing the music?

424
00:25:44,662 --> 00:25:47,398
- I can't, not yet.
- It doesn't seem right, though,

425
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:49,467
just leaving
with nothing.

426
00:25:49,468 --> 00:25:51,268
<i>I've seen the place.</i>

427
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:53,571
You all.

428
00:25:55,307 --> 00:25:58,175
It's better than nothing.

429
00:25:58,176 --> 00:26:00,377
<i>Golly:
Come on, son.</i>

430
00:26:00,378 --> 00:26:03,614
Come on, I'll give you
a lift to the station.

431
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:15,892
I've told Archie
and Lexie, of course.

432
00:26:15,893 --> 00:26:19,330
But I wanted you to know
from me, not second-hand.

433
00:26:19,331 --> 00:26:21,265
But where will you go?
How will you live?

434
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:25,503
There are one or two minor
details to hammer out.

435
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:29,706
I have friends and
contacts all over the world.

436
00:26:29,707 --> 00:26:31,775
I could put you
in touch with them.

437
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:34,311
You'd be guaranteed
a warm welcome.

438
00:26:34,312 --> 00:26:36,213
Thank you.

439
00:26:37,782 --> 00:26:41,718
Or, I could come
with you.

440
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:43,987
As a friend,
nothing else.

441
00:26:43,988 --> 00:26:46,590
I wouldn't dream
of dragging you away.

442
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:49,893
Your cottage,
you're so happy here.

443
00:26:49,894 --> 00:26:52,196
Bricks and mortar,
Molly.

444
00:26:52,197 --> 00:26:54,298
That's not where
the heart is.

445
00:26:59,504 --> 00:27:01,472
I hope I haven't
offended you.

446
00:27:01,473 --> 00:27:04,841
Not at all.
It's a very kind offer.

447
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:08,879
And I shall give it
some thought.

448
00:27:14,052 --> 00:27:17,288
It's been a shock,
son, for Archie.

449
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:20,324
It'll take him a wee
while to get used to it.

450
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:22,660
It's been a shock
for me too.

451
00:27:22,661 --> 00:27:24,895
But it's more
than that with him.

452
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:30,734
He looks at me and he sees
something he can't handle.

453
00:27:30,735 --> 00:27:32,836
I don't know what it is.

454
00:27:41,846 --> 00:27:43,780
<i>Golly: They'll be watching the station.</i>

455
00:27:45,684 --> 00:27:47,284
I'll take you back,

456
00:27:47,285 --> 00:27:50,053
wait until nightfall
and then you can get past them.

457
00:27:50,054 --> 00:27:52,489
Golly, I've got you
in enough trouble as it is.

458
00:28:06,571 --> 00:28:09,039
But Archie? Lexie?

459
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,041
Oh, they'll be fine.

460
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:13,077
Well, me then?

461
00:28:13,078 --> 00:28:15,979
Your friendship means a
great deal to me, Kilwillie,

462
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,315
but the day
has come for me

463
00:28:18,316 --> 00:28:20,984
to break the bonds
of Glenbogle.

464
00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:23,920
Archie did tell me a bit
about the circumstances.

465
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:25,855
Hector?

466
00:28:25,856 --> 00:28:28,058
<i>It came as a bit
of a shock.</i>

467
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:30,794
So Hector never
confided in you?

468
00:28:30,795 --> 00:28:34,598
No, he didn't. Just
in Golly, apparently.

469
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:38,502
- Golly knew?
- According to Archie.

470
00:28:38,503 --> 00:28:40,571
And he said nothing.

471
00:28:40,572 --> 00:28:42,206
I beg you
to reconsider.

472
00:28:42,207 --> 00:28:45,175
This is a time when you should
be among your friends, Molly,

473
00:28:45,176 --> 00:28:47,644
- not all alone in the world.
- I won't be all alone.

474
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:50,180
Andrew's offered
to come with me.

475
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:57,321
He's on the run from the army,
he's put Kilwillie's back up,

476
00:28:57,322 --> 00:29:00,023
he's turned Golly against me,
how can you defend him?

477
00:29:00,024 --> 00:29:03,994
Because he's your own
flesh and blood, Archie.

478
00:29:03,995 --> 00:29:07,297
<i>- he's risked everything to come here.
- Yeah, to cause trouble.</i>

479
00:29:07,298 --> 00:29:10,367
To find out a little bit
about your father.

480
00:29:10,368 --> 00:29:14,671
A few scraps,
other people's memories.

481
00:29:14,672 --> 00:29:16,773
It means a lot, Arch,
believe me.

482
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:21,878
He'll be gone
by nightfall.

483
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:23,880
Go and see him, eh?

484
00:29:36,994 --> 00:29:39,929
You knew and you
said nothing.

485
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,932
- I thought it was the right thing to do.
- For whom?

486
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:45,602
I've carried this for 30 years
and I would gladly carry it

487
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:47,638
for 30 more to protect
what I hold dear.

488
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:50,440
What?
Hector's reputation?

489
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:52,242
No, your family.

490
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:54,978
I'm leaving.

491
00:29:54,979 --> 00:29:58,382
Are you? You did that once before.

492
00:30:00,418 --> 00:30:02,386
How dare you?

493
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:08,158
You know nothing about
what happened that day.

494
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,126
Nothing at all,
or why I left.

495
00:30:10,127 --> 00:30:14,164
- I was 19. I came back, didn't I?
- I know, by then

496
00:30:14,165 --> 00:30:17,534
- Megan was already carrying Hector's child.
- And so was I.

497
00:30:17,535 --> 00:30:20,637
- You can't blame me for that.
- I don't,

498
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:22,506
but I don't blame
Hector either.

499
00:30:22,507 --> 00:30:25,676
Listen, Molly,

500
00:30:25,677 --> 00:30:28,812
it is too late for him
to ask your forgiveness,

501
00:30:28,813 --> 00:30:31,981
but it is not too late
for you to grant it.

502
00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:49,199
You worked for
Archie long?

503
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,468
Born into it.

504
00:30:51,469 --> 00:30:53,437
Part of the
furniture, eh?

505
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:55,772
Aye.

506
00:30:55,773 --> 00:30:58,975
What is his problem?

507
00:30:58,976 --> 00:31:01,010
It's not really
his fault.

508
00:31:01,011 --> 00:31:03,913
He's got a lot to put up
with, being the laird and all.

509
00:31:03,914 --> 00:31:07,251
It can't be easy,
doing that all on your own.

510
00:31:07,252 --> 00:31:09,453
He lost a brother,
didn't he?

511
00:31:09,454 --> 00:31:13,457
Jamie, aye, drowned trying
to save the family labrador.

512
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:16,893
Archie was there, mind,
but nothing he could do.

513
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,957
He loved this view.

514
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:50,460
He loved my mother.

515
00:31:50,461 --> 00:31:52,862
He was an average
fisherman,

516
00:31:52,863 --> 00:31:55,599
a rather poor golfer.

517
00:31:56,934 --> 00:31:59,770
He loved his dogs,

518
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:02,506
the hills,

519
00:32:02,507 --> 00:32:04,541
loved his malt,

520
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:06,876
especially that.

521
00:32:08,513 --> 00:32:11,615
He fought in Korea,

522
00:32:11,616 --> 00:32:13,717
he was stubborn,

523
00:32:13,718 --> 00:32:16,219
sometimes stupid.

524
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,988
He often talked
too much,

525
00:32:20,358 --> 00:32:22,726
sometimes not enough.

526
00:32:24,796 --> 00:32:27,096
And we thought
the world of him.

527
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:32,168
Thank you, Archie.

528
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,676
Duncan told me
what happened to Jamie.

529
00:32:41,746 --> 00:32:44,414
I'm really sorry
for you.

530
00:32:45,983 --> 00:32:48,452
I want you to go now.

531
00:33:10,274 --> 00:33:12,642
<i>Andrew: Golly?</i>

532
00:33:12,643 --> 00:33:14,411
I was looking
for Kilwillie.

533
00:33:14,412 --> 00:33:16,346
He said he was coming
up to see you.

534
00:33:16,347 --> 00:33:18,515
Did he?

535
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:20,550
Something wrong?

536
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:24,087
You've not heard then, that
Molly's intent upon leaving?

537
00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:26,623
Well, is that
a bad thing?

538
00:33:26,624 --> 00:33:29,325
I'd like to know who's
been encouraging her.

539
00:33:31,328 --> 00:33:35,365
- Well, perhaps she needs a break.
- No.

540
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:37,667
No, she needs to stay
and face things.

541
00:33:37,668 --> 00:33:39,870
If she runs now, she'll
be running forever.

542
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:44,340
Maybe you're right.

543
00:33:44,341 --> 00:33:46,710
I am right.

544
00:33:52,316 --> 00:33:54,384
...tie it and secure it.

545
00:33:54,385 --> 00:33:56,052
His lordship...

546
00:33:57,622 --> 00:34:00,957
that man has taken
leave of his senses.

547
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:02,959
If we let him
finish it,

548
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,428
you can kiss goodbye
to your water.

549
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:08,398
It's okay,
we'll deal with it.

550
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,433
You don't have
to get involved.

551
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:12,135
Well...

552
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:14,504
since I'm here, it's the least I can do.

553
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:17,707
Yeah, and I have a plan.

554
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:20,143
Good, Duncan.

555
00:34:20,144 --> 00:34:22,245
I'll create a diversion,

556
00:34:22,246 --> 00:34:25,081
lead these three on a merry
dance through the woods,

557
00:34:25,082 --> 00:34:27,651
and you two take
down the fence.

558
00:34:27,652 --> 00:34:29,819
Will they not just
put it back up again?

559
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,455
<i>Paul: Yes, but sometimes
you have to show the enemy</i>

560
00:34:32,456 --> 00:34:34,957
you can be as bloody-minded
as they are.

561
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:37,860
Drag them to
the negotiating table.

562
00:34:37,861 --> 00:34:43,233
<i>- right, Duncan?
- That was my thinking, exactly.</i>

563
00:34:43,234 --> 00:34:46,035
Okay, Duncan,
let's go with it.

564
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:03,052
All right, Duncan.

565
00:35:07,391 --> 00:35:09,392
Come on, lads,

566
00:35:09,393 --> 00:35:11,695
I haven't even
started yet.

567
00:35:11,696 --> 00:35:14,063
Come on.

568
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:18,768
We've got
our diversion,

569
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:20,903
let's get on
with the job.

570
00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:27,510
Badger?

571
00:35:28,979 --> 00:35:30,847
What brings you here?

572
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:34,150
Just trying to walk off the
effects of Golly's cooking.

573
00:35:34,151 --> 00:35:35,752
<i>Good lunch, was it?</i>

574
00:35:35,753 --> 00:35:39,556
<i>Venison, potatoes,
fresh vegetables.</i>

575
00:35:39,557 --> 00:35:41,691
What was that sauce,
Golly?

576
00:35:41,692 --> 00:35:44,527
It was red wine,
mustard and wild thyme.

577
00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:46,630
That must have
been grand.

578
00:35:46,631 --> 00:35:49,266
It still is.
We couldn't finish it.

579
00:35:49,267 --> 00:35:52,168
We were wondering maybe if
you could help us out there.

580
00:35:52,169 --> 00:35:55,138
Well, what about
my duties?

581
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:59,075
There are times, Badger, when
duty betrays common sense,

582
00:35:59,076 --> 00:36:01,311
and we foot soldiers,
as it were,

583
00:36:01,312 --> 00:36:04,914
should unite to put
an end to this madness.

584
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:07,083
Aye, aye.

585
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:11,120
We're lions led
by donkeys right enough.

586
00:36:12,189 --> 00:36:15,024
I'd be happy
to take lunch with you.

587
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:16,993
Excellent.

588
00:36:18,696 --> 00:36:20,630
This way, Badger.

589
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:23,433
Look after
our guest, Golly.

590
00:36:23,434 --> 00:36:25,067
My pleasure, Paul.

591
00:36:32,777 --> 00:36:34,778
( humming )

592
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,649
I'm sorry, Badger,
I hope you don't mind,

593
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:42,051
but seeing as how
they've captured Duncan.

594
00:36:42,052 --> 00:36:45,555
I'd rather be a prisoner of a gentleman

595
00:36:45,556 --> 00:36:49,158
than a free man
in a world gone mad.

596
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:52,329
<i>Lexie: This water business is a farce.</i>

597
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,297
You've let it get
completely out of control.

598
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:56,700
Kilwillie's entitled
to protect what's his.

599
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:58,702
Anyway, he didn't
start it.

600
00:36:58,703 --> 00:37:00,570
<i>Paul did.</i>

601
00:37:00,571 --> 00:37:03,239
All his fault
as per usual.

602
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,241
Give him a break,
Arch.

603
00:37:05,242 --> 00:37:07,711
He's upset everyone.
He's upset mother.

604
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,679
You can't blame him,
it's not his fault.

605
00:37:11,482 --> 00:37:14,116
- Where are you going?
- There's something I have to do.

606
00:37:14,117 --> 00:37:16,052
<i>Send Duncan.</i>

607
00:37:16,053 --> 00:37:17,687
I can't.

608
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:23,059
I think he was finally beginning
to believe he could do it.

609
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,562
You know, be the laird.

610
00:37:25,563 --> 00:37:28,097
<i>Molly,</i>

611
00:37:28,098 --> 00:37:30,700
don't go, please.

612
00:37:34,037 --> 00:37:38,341
- Kilwillie: Are we ready for the exchange of prisoners?
- That we are, your lordship.

613
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:40,877
Good.
Send Badger over.

614
00:37:40,878 --> 00:37:44,714
Not on your life.
You give us Duncan first.

615
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:48,217
This is my land,
send over Badger.

616
00:37:48,218 --> 00:37:51,320
I don't care. You give us
Duncan and we'll give you Badger.

617
00:37:51,321 --> 00:37:54,156
- Badger!
- Duncan!

618
00:37:54,157 --> 00:37:57,159
Lexie:
Right, now let me through.

619
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,763
<i>Now, Lexie,
this is men's talk.</i>

620
00:37:59,764 --> 00:38:01,964
Out of your backsides,
as usual.

621
00:38:01,965 --> 00:38:06,335
Now, do you expect Golly
to live without water?

622
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,772
Well, it's a precious
commercial asset.

623
00:38:08,773 --> 00:38:10,774
And you really think
that Golly's needs

624
00:38:10,775 --> 00:38:13,075
will make a scrap of
difference to your business?

625
00:38:13,076 --> 00:38:15,478
This is a matter
of principle.

626
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:17,146
Principle?

627
00:38:17,147 --> 00:38:20,917
Listen, there are people
hurting round here.

628
00:38:20,918 --> 00:38:23,420
Archie and Paul
over there.

629
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:25,354
And what about Molly,
too, Kilwillie?

630
00:38:25,355 --> 00:38:27,356
<i>Don't forget about her.</i>

631
00:38:27,357 --> 00:38:30,827
And you are standing here bickering
over a matter of principle.

632
00:38:30,828 --> 00:38:33,996
Over a small amount
of water.

633
00:38:33,997 --> 00:38:37,166
Don't you know that there's
more to life than that?

634
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:39,101
Hear, hear.

635
00:38:45,142 --> 00:38:47,343
I'm a reasonable
man, Lexie.

636
00:38:47,344 --> 00:38:49,746
If you've got a suggestion,
I'll listen to it.

637
00:38:49,747 --> 00:38:51,548
Thank you.

638
00:38:51,549 --> 00:38:54,250
Now, we can start by
taking care of our friends.

639
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:56,719
I have a plan which
involves you all,

640
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,021
and which,
by the way, gentlemen,

641
00:38:59,022 --> 00:39:01,891
is not optional.

642
00:39:01,892 --> 00:39:03,760
Come on.

643
00:39:13,938 --> 00:39:15,638
Well?

644
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:17,841
Well, the thing is,
Archie,

645
00:39:17,842 --> 00:39:20,844
I've been a damned fool.

646
00:39:22,713 --> 00:39:25,081
You were only trying
to protect your own.

647
00:39:25,082 --> 00:39:27,350
If it's at the expense
of one's friendships

648
00:39:27,351 --> 00:39:29,953
then it's a very
poor show.

649
00:39:29,954 --> 00:39:33,890
Golly will have his water
at an annual peppercorn rent.

650
00:39:33,891 --> 00:39:36,258
That's very generous
of you.

651
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:38,761
And didn't you have something
else in mind, Kilwillie,

652
00:39:38,762 --> 00:39:40,429
as a sort
of goodwill gesture?

653
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,499
Oh, all right.

654
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,901
Golly can take advantage
of my offer much sooner

655
00:39:44,902 --> 00:39:47,103
if he has some assistance
with the building work.

656
00:39:47,104 --> 00:39:48,938
What did you have in mind?

657
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:54,844
I should like to place my estate
workers at his disposal today.

658
00:39:54,845 --> 00:39:57,881
Many hands, as we know,
make light work.

659
00:39:57,882 --> 00:40:00,850
- He'll be very grateful.
- We can help too, Arch.

660
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:03,720
No, no, I won't go to
Golly's house. You know why.

661
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:05,287
I know why
you should-

662
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:07,557
because he's your ghillie
and you're his boss.

663
00:40:09,026 --> 00:40:11,728
Okay, so I'll go and
round up some helpers

664
00:40:11,729 --> 00:40:13,429
but the laird should
be there, too.

665
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,865
As you said, Glenbogle
does come first.

666
00:40:21,772 --> 00:40:25,241
<i>- ( knocking )
- Come in.</i>

667
00:40:25,242 --> 00:40:27,210
Here you go.

668
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:31,247
Not too much,
is there?

669
00:40:31,248 --> 00:40:33,583
You tell me,
Molly.

670
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:40,723
You've unfinished
business here,

671
00:40:40,724 --> 00:40:42,892
<i>and you know it.</i>

672
00:40:44,395 --> 00:40:47,697
<i>- ( people talking )
- What's going on?</i>

673
00:41:00,611 --> 00:41:02,379
<i>Quite a turnout.</i>

674
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,614
It'll be a good time
to say goodbye at least.

675
00:41:05,649 --> 00:41:07,917
No.

676
00:41:07,918 --> 00:41:11,321
Pack a bag and slip out
the back door?

677
00:41:11,322 --> 00:41:15,091
That may be my style, Molly,
it certainly isn't yours.

678
00:41:18,929 --> 00:41:20,897
Put you backs
into it, lads.

679
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:22,832
Lord Kilwillie's
orders.

680
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:26,336
He'll be back at
headquarters, I suppose?

681
00:41:26,337 --> 00:41:28,338
Messed up, didn't I?

682
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:30,407
Good old Dunc.

683
00:41:30,408 --> 00:41:32,575
Can't even create
a diversion.

684
00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:44,887
Duncan!

685
00:41:44,888 --> 00:41:46,856
Aye, here
we go again.

686
00:41:46,857 --> 00:41:48,925
Golly: Better see what the man wants.

687
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:52,362
Boss.

688
00:41:54,698 --> 00:41:56,599
Hey, Big Eric.

689
00:41:59,103 --> 00:42:01,604
We'll not see his like
round here for a while.

690
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:04,240
Nope. read it.

691
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:17,520
They're yours, Dunc,
you did a good job.

692
00:42:20,424 --> 00:42:22,625
There's beer and food
for everyone here.

693
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:24,594
All right?

694
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:31,901
So, what can I do?

695
00:42:31,902 --> 00:42:34,737
Paul: You can give me a
hand with this, I suppose.

696
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:46,416
- Where do you want it?
- Up there.

697
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:48,118
Ready when you are.

698
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,574
Goodbyes are hard.

699
00:43:15,045 --> 00:43:18,047
<i>Molly: That's Hector's
son down there with Archie.</i>

700
00:43:20,618 --> 00:43:23,586
His son, not mine.

701
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:28,691
<i>Are you surprised
I want to leave?</i>

702
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:30,693
No...

703
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:32,928
but I'll be surprised
if you do.

704
00:43:34,165 --> 00:43:37,033
I don't think
you'll run away.

705
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:46,042
You're right.

706
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:50,880
Shall we join them?

707
00:43:53,284 --> 00:43:55,751
I'll go
and unpack first.

708
00:44:01,158 --> 00:44:03,159
( Useless barking )

709
00:44:11,368 --> 00:44:13,570
It's fortunate
that neither of you

710
00:44:13,571 --> 00:44:16,138
inherited your father's
D.I.Y. Skills.

711
00:44:18,342 --> 00:44:21,277
<i>- Useless?
- Golly: He'll be back.</i>

712
00:44:31,121 --> 00:44:33,923
Look, Golly, I'm sorry.

713
00:44:33,924 --> 00:44:36,459
<i>I had no right to talk
to you the way that I did.</i>

714
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:40,296
This has been a lot
tougher for you

715
00:44:40,297 --> 00:44:42,031
than most people imagine.

716
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,071
It was like
he'd come back.

717
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:54,477
But it wasn't him,
it could never be.

718
00:44:54,478 --> 00:44:57,179
<i>Archie, Archie,</i>

719
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,382
you were a child then.

720
00:44:59,383 --> 00:45:01,484
Stop blaming yourself.

721
00:45:02,853 --> 00:45:05,788
<i>Jamie would have
been a fine laird,</i>

722
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:08,458
but he couldn't
have done more

723
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:10,326
or better than you.

724
00:45:12,596 --> 00:45:15,030
Don't look back
anymore, son.

725
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:18,434
Perhaps I should
talk to Paul.

726
00:45:20,537 --> 00:45:22,838
<i>I can't tell you
how to feel but...</i>

727
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:26,442
if I'd lost
a brother...

728
00:45:27,645 --> 00:45:30,480
I'd be in no mind
to lose another.

729
00:45:52,302 --> 00:45:54,737
<i>( Useless whining )</i>

730
00:46:03,547 --> 00:46:05,481
Get away from
the edge, Paul, come on.

731
00:46:05,482 --> 00:46:07,750
Useless is stuck,
poor lad.

732
00:46:07,751 --> 00:46:09,318
He'll make his
own way back.

733
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:11,654
No, he won't.
Come on.

734
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:16,559
Here.

735
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,527
Come on, Useless.

736
00:46:22,799 --> 00:46:24,867
<i>- Got him?
- yep.</i>

737
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:27,936
Here, give me your hand.
Come on.

738
00:46:27,937 --> 00:46:29,938
Paul!

739
00:46:43,587 --> 00:46:45,521
It's Archie.

740
00:46:51,461 --> 00:46:53,228
Archie!

741
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:22,224
Where are they?
Where are they?

742
00:47:26,863 --> 00:47:28,297
What's going on?

743
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:34,002
I can't see them.

744
00:47:37,574 --> 00:47:38,974
( large gasping )

745
00:47:38,975 --> 00:47:43,579
Archie!

746
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:50,553
- Have you got him, Golly?
- I've got him, I've got him.

747
00:47:50,554 --> 00:47:52,287
- On your feet.
- I've got him.

748
00:47:52,288 --> 00:47:54,389
- Go!
- I've got him.

749
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:57,392
- Let's get him out.
- Come on!

750
00:47:57,393 --> 00:48:00,629
Duncan:
Come on, lie him down!

751
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,397
Archie?

752
00:48:17,581 --> 00:48:19,548
You okay?

753
00:48:23,353 --> 00:48:25,554
Welcome back.

754
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:30,125
( whimpers )

755
00:48:30,126 --> 00:48:32,695
You shouldn't be
drinking beer, young lady.

756
00:48:32,696 --> 00:48:34,429
And why not?

757
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:36,098
Because you know
what it does to you.

758
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:38,968
You, Golly, know
far too much about me.

759
00:48:40,537 --> 00:48:43,739
Listen, Molly,
I really am sorry

760
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,340
that I kept it
from you.

761
00:48:52,682 --> 00:48:55,050
Mrs. MacDonald,
I wanted to apologize-

762
00:48:55,051 --> 00:48:57,586
no, please,
there's really no need.

763
00:48:57,587 --> 00:49:00,222
So, you'll be staying
for a while?

764
00:49:00,223 --> 00:49:03,792
No, I'm going to go
back to my regiment.

765
00:49:03,793 --> 00:49:07,830
Well then, you must
visit us whenever you can.

766
00:49:07,831 --> 00:49:11,400
Your father loved this
place. His heart was here.

767
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,806
Thank you.

768
00:49:20,076 --> 00:49:24,379
So, it looks like I'll have
you under my feet after all.

769
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,482
You know, Glenbogle wouldn't
be the same without you, mother.

770
00:49:27,483 --> 00:49:30,385
And it wouldn't be the success
it is without you, Archie.

771
00:49:30,386 --> 00:49:33,422
You've done it, you've
turned this place around.

772
00:49:33,423 --> 00:49:35,891
With a little help.

773
00:49:35,892 --> 00:49:37,793
<i>Kilwillie:
So, you two,</i>

774
00:49:37,794 --> 00:49:39,828
is the honeymoon back
on the agenda?

775
00:49:39,829 --> 00:49:41,630
No, I don't think
we can-

776
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,298
well, mother's not
going anywhere.

777
00:49:43,299 --> 00:49:45,233
Golly and Duncan can
look after the place.

778
00:49:45,234 --> 00:49:48,737
I'm sure you'll keep a neighborly
eye out. So, what's to stop us?

779
00:49:52,141 --> 00:49:54,142
Oh, Kilwillie.

780
00:49:54,143 --> 00:49:56,045
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you.

781
00:49:56,046 --> 00:49:58,313
<i>- ( footsteps approaching )
- Come on, come on,</i>

782
00:49:58,314 --> 00:50:00,415
don't keep the man
waiting.

783
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:02,451
Lexie: We're coming,
we're coming. sorry.

784
00:50:02,452 --> 00:50:04,386
It took so long
- have you got the tickets?

785
00:50:04,387 --> 00:50:06,388
Yes, they're here,
come on.

786
00:50:06,389 --> 00:50:07,856
<i>Molly:
Let me help you.</i>

787
00:50:07,857 --> 00:50:10,626
<i>- Duncan: goodbye!
- Last one.</i>

788
00:50:10,627 --> 00:50:12,427
That's it.

789
00:50:12,428 --> 00:50:15,698
Goodbye my darlings,
have a lovely time.

790
00:50:15,699 --> 00:50:17,666
<i>Duncan:
Take care.</i>

791
00:50:39,089 --> 00:50:41,090
See ya!
Take care.

792
00:50:42,191 --> 00:50:44,326
Bye.

793
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:56,471

- Bye!
