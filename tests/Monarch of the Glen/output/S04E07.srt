1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,934
Norton commando.

2
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:13,709
Thought so.

3
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:18,513
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Archie. Take a seat.

4
00:00:18,514 --> 00:00:21,583
- Coffee?
- No thanks.

5
00:00:21,584 --> 00:00:24,319
Just tell me,
how bad is it?

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,388
Now, the deadline for
the death duties is up.

7
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:29,390
<i>You've got
two days to pay</i>

8
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:32,761
or you'll start to accrue a
significant amount of interest,

9
00:00:32,762 --> 00:00:37,032
and that's on top
of the original sum.

10
00:00:39,202 --> 00:00:42,337
I had a client in a similar
position not so long ago.

11
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:44,906
- And what happened?
- Bankrupt within a month.

12
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:49,911
<i>Now, the bank have made
their position very clear.</i>

13
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:51,613
<i>They'll offer
no more help</i>

14
00:00:51,614 --> 00:00:54,015
<i>until this debt
has been satisfied.</i>

15
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,418
So your only chance is to
raise the money yourself.

16
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:59,121
I don't see how.

17
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:02,190
The wolf park is making a profit
but it's nowhere near what we need.

18
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:05,360
- There must be other ways.
- I've tried them all.

19
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,763
The ones I can
think of anyway.

20
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:11,432
- Surely there must be something you can do.
- Sorry, Archie,

21
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:13,368
I'm a solicitor,

22
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:15,237
not a miracle worker.

23
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:18,907
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

24
00:02:00,182 --> 00:02:02,149
Thank you for coming,
Kilwillie.

25
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,019
Well, actually, I was
rather looking for an excuse.

26
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,788
You've never needed
one before.

27
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:09,657
I wasn't sure what sort of
reception I'd get from your mother.

28
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:11,993
Yes, after your declaration of devotion.

29
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:15,062
I did think I was about to enter
the celestial city at the time.

30
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:17,098
You were drugged,
she knows that.

31
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,601
- She didn't take me seriously?
- No, of course not.

32
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:24,171
Oh-
well, that's a relief.

33
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:26,508
So, what is it you
wanted to see me about?

34
00:02:28,644 --> 00:02:30,945
If you needed to lay your
hands on a substantial sum

35
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:34,883
of money very, very quickly,
how would you go about it?

36
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:37,385
<i>Well, strictly
entre nous,</i>

37
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:39,988
Inverness to Heathrow,
Heathrow to Zurich,

38
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,156
taxi to the National
Bank of Switzerland,

39
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:45,159
back with my feet up at
Kilwillie Castle inside 16 hours.

40
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,995
And if that
wasn't an option?

41
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:50,364
- Stocks and bonds.
- Nor that?

42
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:52,366
Oh.

43
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:54,168
Well, I suppose,
at a pinch,

44
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:56,804
I could do without the
XJ6 or one of the Bentleys,

45
00:02:56,805 --> 00:02:59,373
but it seems a pity
to split the collection.

46
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:02,209
You're not feeling the
fiscal squeeze, are you?

47
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,378
Yes.

48
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,081
The solution's
obvious, I'd say.

49
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:09,083
Not to me,
it isn't.

50
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:11,619
I'll always give you a
fair price for land, Archie,

51
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,722
- as long as it's the right piece.
- Absolutely not.

52
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:17,759
Oh well, it's up
to you, old boy.

53
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,775
Excuse me.

54
00:03:33,776 --> 00:03:36,978
I think we need to
have some words, laddie.

55
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:39,413
It's a long time since
anyone called me that.

56
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:41,515
Yeah, it must be.

57
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:44,018
So I'd say you were old
enough to know better.

58
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,621
- Not with you.
- You nearly had me over in the village.

59
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:49,824
- I'm sorry.
- And now you're on a private estate.

60
00:03:49,825 --> 00:03:51,626
<i>- I had no idea.
- evidently.</i>

61
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:54,328
Is there a telephone nearby?
She's just not turning over.

62
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:56,530
Down that way,

63
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:58,566
<i>about 10 miles.</i>

64
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:02,269
Nice bike, by the way.

65
00:04:10,178 --> 00:04:12,981
- Kilwillie?
- Oh, Molly.

66
00:04:12,982 --> 00:04:16,250
Matter of fact, I... I've been
meaning to come and see you.

67
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:18,920
- Really?
- Yes.

68
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:21,823
I want to clear up
any misunderstanding.

69
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:24,325
What misunderstanding
might that be?

70
00:04:24,326 --> 00:04:26,661
Well, I-I said
a few things that-

71
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:28,630
- you didn't mean?
- No!

72
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:31,532
So you did mean them?

73
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:33,968
When a chap thinks
his number's up

74
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:36,738
he can become
rather emotional.

75
00:04:36,739 --> 00:04:39,107
If that chap harbors
certain feelings,

76
00:04:39,108 --> 00:04:41,208
well, he might
be inclined

77
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:44,145
to articulate them a bit
more than he would otherwise,

78
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:46,914
if circumstances
were different.

79
00:04:48,283 --> 00:04:50,451
Oh, please say
you're not cross.

80
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:53,454
- You were Hector's best friend.
- And proud of it!

81
00:04:53,455 --> 00:04:56,024
I thought you would have
more respect for his memory.

82
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:59,226
Oh, Molly, a moment's
indiscretion.

83
00:04:59,227 --> 00:05:01,228
Can't we just put
it behind us?

84
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:03,264
Forgive and forget?

85
00:05:03,265 --> 00:05:05,066
In time, probably,

86
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,802
but I can't pretend that
I'm not very disappointed.

87
00:05:13,642 --> 00:05:15,509
( groans )

88
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:22,283
( sighs )

89
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:27,022
Archie: Nothing we could
sell would be worth anything.

90
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:29,024
We don't want to sell
the river or the loch

91
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:31,326
and obviously Ben Bogle
has to be protected.

92
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:34,462
This is the Grouse Moor, this
is where we stock the deer.

93
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:36,797
Exactly, so they're out.

94
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:39,700
Then I'd say
- then I'd say it has to be here.

95
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:41,503
That's Doon Brae,
no, we can't.

96
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:44,372
Whichever bit we let go, it's
not going to hurt any less.

97
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:47,308
We'd lose a huge stretch of water
and all access from the south.

98
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:49,477
It would make things
impossible.

99
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:52,580
It joins Kilwillie's land which
means he'll pay good money.

100
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:57,385
Archie, sometimes we have to cull
the herd to ensure its survival.

101
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:02,924
Maybe you're right.

102
00:06:06,162 --> 00:06:08,930
It'll be a hell of a wrench
letting that go.

103
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:11,499
I think it's my favorite
spot on the whole estate,

104
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,468
ever since
I was a boy.

105
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,372
There's not a view
like it.

106
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:20,041
<i>( washer spinning )</i>

107
00:06:30,852 --> 00:06:32,853
Duncan, what are
you doing?

108
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:34,789
Just thought I'd
finish this off for you.

109
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,159
You've done
that all right.

110
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,529
And how am I supposed
to use this?

111
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,898
- I was just trying to help.
- You're not.

112
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,500
And leaving a stone
in your shirt

113
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:48,002
wasn't the smartest thing
you could have done either.

114
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:50,071
You shouldn't be
keeping secrets from me.

115
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:51,672
<i>I know what
the matter is.</i>

116
00:06:51,673 --> 00:06:53,941
- How?
- Archie told me.

117
00:06:53,942 --> 00:06:56,344
Archie?
What did he say?

118
00:06:56,345 --> 00:06:59,747
The estate's in trouble. That's why
you've been in a bad mood, isn't it?

119
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:02,383
- No.
- Well, you admit you are then.

120
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:09,124
Relationships are
all about communication.

121
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,659
We must listen
to each other very care-

122
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,162
- what did you say about a stone?
- In your washing.

123
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:16,931
You know what kind of damage
that could do to the machine?

124
00:07:16,932 --> 00:07:19,434
- Where is it now?
- I threw it outside in the yard.

125
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:30,211
( gasps )

126
00:07:39,188 --> 00:07:40,921
Oh, no.

127
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:43,191
Please, no.

128
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:45,693
It's for the driveway.
They've just delivered it.

129
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:49,531
<i>- Splendid news.
- Archie: is it?</i>

130
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:52,267
Absolutely. You want
to sell, I want to buy.

131
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:53,668
Do us both
a bit of good.

132
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:58,105
Hold on, there are
other interested parties.

133
00:07:58,106 --> 00:08:00,775
You would put them before
your father's greatest chum?

134
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:03,411
I'm afraid all I care about
is getting the best price.

135
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:05,346
I see.

136
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:07,682
That isn't how Hector
would have managed things.

137
00:08:07,683 --> 00:08:09,917
And I think that's a
valuable lesson to us all.

138
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:11,886
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

139
00:08:13,922 --> 00:08:16,791
- Archie, have you got a minute?
- Not now, no.

140
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:18,926
It's important.

141
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:22,564
<i>It had better be.
I'm sorry.</i>

142
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:24,999
It's not a problem,
take as long as you like.

143
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:33,841
Do you think
he'll go for it?

144
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:36,244
Yeah, he's bound to, he
won't be able to resist.

145
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,685
Probably best
not to ask.

146
00:08:59,535 --> 00:09:01,536
Oh, I think
the Kilwillie coffers

147
00:09:01,537 --> 00:09:03,504
can run to a better
offer than those.

148
00:09:08,977 --> 00:09:10,778
- Well?
- Nope.

149
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:12,680
Told you.

150
00:09:21,624 --> 00:09:25,126
Oh!
I don't believe it.

151
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:28,195
<i>- it's not.
- It is.</i>

152
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:32,433
My lucky wish stone.

153
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:35,770
<i>- I've had it since I was a boy.
- How does that work then?</i>

154
00:09:35,771 --> 00:09:38,072
Rub it over
your lottery tickets?

155
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:40,642
It was a christening present.
A friend of my granny's,

156
00:09:40,643 --> 00:09:43,177
an old woman
with the power.

157
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:46,247
I tell it my wish
and then I turn round twice,

158
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:49,517
I throw the stone in the loch
and then that wish comes true.

159
00:09:49,518 --> 00:09:52,853
- So why have you never done it?
- You only get one go.

160
00:09:52,854 --> 00:09:55,623
But there must have
been things you've wanted.

161
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:57,792
So I'm saving
this beauty

162
00:09:57,793 --> 00:10:00,027
for something
really special.

163
00:10:01,563 --> 00:10:04,131
If only life
was that simple.

164
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,238
Well done, Archie.
I knew you'd see sense.

165
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:13,974
I'll get onto McGregor,
have him call in a surveyor,

166
00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:17,312
- get the exact boundaries drawn up.
- While I arrange the readies.

167
00:10:17,313 --> 00:10:20,247
Well, home for a
celebratory snifter, I think.

168
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:27,221
Actually, I think I might
hang on for a minute or two.

169
00:10:27,222 --> 00:10:29,590
Looks as if we might
be due for a spot of rain.

170
00:10:34,562 --> 00:10:36,397
What's on your mind?

171
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:39,233
It's Irene. I think she's going off me.

172
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:43,171
- What makes you say that?
- It's just she's-

173
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:45,006
acting weird.

174
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,878
Perhaps she thinks that you're
starting to take her for granted.

175
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,782
But I've not, though. I mean, just
last week I bought her chocolates,

176
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:58,352
- and not the ones on special offer.
- ( laughing )

177
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:02,123
And who said
romance was dead?

178
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:05,526
Where is she, anyway?

179
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:07,494
Away in a huff.

180
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:13,634
I don't suppose you could
have a wee talk with her?

181
00:11:13,635 --> 00:11:16,237
Anything else?

182
00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:21,943
Well, if there's any more tea
in the pot, that would be nice.

183
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:31,585
( knocking on door )

184
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,002
What are you doing
knocking at my door?

185
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:51,305
- Think I'd have knocked if I knew you were inside?
- Why did you?

186
00:11:51,306 --> 00:11:53,540
I've been pushing this for
miles, first place I've seen,

187
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,442
there's a motorbike,
somebody might help-

188
00:11:55,443 --> 00:11:57,811
- never mind.
- Wait a minute!

189
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:02,183
It won't hurt to have a look, I suppose.

190
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:07,321
Okay.

191
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,366
- Do you want to talk about it?
- What?

192
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:21,002
- Whatever it is that's on your mind.
- Not really.

193
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:25,139
Is it Duncan?

194
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,174
Partly.

195
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:33,781
If you don't want to go
out with him, just tell him.

196
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:38,886
He won't be happy,
but he will get over it.

197
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:41,522
That's just it, I'm
not sure what I want.

198
00:12:41,523 --> 00:12:44,491
Then explain that to him.
He'll understand.

199
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:46,928
I doubt it.

200
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,366
I'm pregnant, Lexie.

201
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:56,938
- You're what?
- Expecting a baby.

202
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:59,807
Yeah, I know
what it means.

203
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:02,310
It's just a bit
of a shock, that's all.

204
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:05,313
You can say that again.

205
00:13:05,314 --> 00:13:08,449
But Duncan'll
be pleased.

206
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,151
He won't,
believe me.

207
00:13:10,152 --> 00:13:12,686
Most men say they don't
want kids, when it happens-

208
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:15,889
it's not his,
it can't be.

209
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:20,027
- Then whose?
- I was with someone before I came here.

210
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:22,396
I see.

211
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:30,771
Don't. Come here. Come here.

212
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:36,543
Please, don't say anything
to anyone, will you?

213
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:39,347
No, not if you
don't want me to.

214
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:41,915
But you have
to tell Duncan,

215
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,985
sooner rather
than later.

216
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:52,659
Do you know any rosses
living locally?

217
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,296
Not that I
can think of, why?

218
00:13:55,297 --> 00:13:58,732
It's my mother's maiden name.
She came from this area.

219
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:02,203
That's why I'm up here. I'm trying to
track down some long-lost relatives.

220
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:05,606
You could try
the phone book.

221
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:08,675
I have, and the library
and the electoral roll.

222
00:14:08,676 --> 00:14:11,578
And I've ridden through
every village on the map.

223
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:14,882
- No luck?
- No.

224
00:14:14,883 --> 00:14:17,851
Okay.
Give it a whirl.

225
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,159
( engine starts )

226
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:29,663
Sweet as a nut.
You've done this before.

227
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:31,999
I've had plenty
of practice.

228
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:35,969
They say they can
be a bit temperamental.

229
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,339
Cup of tea?

230
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:42,910
Thanks.

231
00:14:49,585 --> 00:14:51,786
<i>Molly: Archie!</i>

232
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:56,356
Archie, they're here.

233
00:14:59,928 --> 00:15:01,762
He'd have understood.

234
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:10,638
No, I've let him down.
I've let you all down.

235
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,209
You had no choice.
Let's get this over with.

236
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,178
- Archie.
- You didn't waste much time, did you?

237
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:20,280
We can't afford to drag
our heels on this one.

238
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:22,984
This is the surveyor,
Greg MacDonald.

239
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,822
What's the matter, lad, would
you rather have had a Campbell?

240
00:15:27,823 --> 00:15:30,357
No, I'm just surprised
we've never met before.

241
00:15:30,358 --> 00:15:33,227
Ach, well, we live over
the other side of Inverness

242
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:35,362
and we keep ourselves
to ourselves,

243
00:15:35,363 --> 00:15:37,098
<i>- don't we, Morag?
- Aye.</i>

244
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:38,666
<i>- my wife.
- Hello.</i>

245
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:41,435
<i>I thought she ought
to be here,</i>

246
00:15:41,436 --> 00:15:44,605
- today of all days.
- Sorry?

247
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:48,676
Our first chance to see inside the
great ancestral home of the clan.

248
00:15:48,677 --> 00:15:51,578
Tell me... is that not

249
00:15:51,579 --> 00:15:54,749
William MacDonald,
the great duelist?

250
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:59,286
Um...
I think so.

251
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:01,088
Oh, definitely,
I'd say.

252
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:03,958
- We really ought to make a start.
- Yes, of course.

253
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:07,795
But I really think you ought to
hear what I have to say first.

254
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:15,870
Duncan.

255
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,205
- I know what you're gonna say.
- I doubt that.

256
00:16:18,206 --> 00:16:20,274
You don't think
I'm serious about you.

257
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:22,476
Well, I've had an idea.

258
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:24,845
I'd like you
to meet my Auntie Liz.

259
00:16:24,846 --> 00:16:27,548
- What?
- You'll really like her.

260
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:29,216
The thing is-

261
00:16:30,752 --> 00:16:32,386
trying to catch
her at home.

262
00:16:32,387 --> 00:16:34,354
She gets out
and about all over-

263
00:16:34,355 --> 00:16:38,325
Monday night- bingo, every
second Tuesday- folk club,

264
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:40,527
Wednesdays-
self defense.

265
00:16:40,528 --> 00:16:44,364
- Sounds like a busy lady.
- She is, but she can fit us in this evening.

266
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:46,600
How's that
for a stroke of luck?

267
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:48,435
I'm really not sure
I ought to come.

268
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:50,304
- Duncan-
- please.

269
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:52,539
It would mean
a lot to me.

270
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:56,343
- Okay.
- Great.

271
00:16:59,848 --> 00:17:02,482
I'll give her a call...

272
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:05,920
before she puts her name
down for the dominoes.

273
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:13,728
Bear with me,
it's in here somewhere.

274
00:17:15,063 --> 00:17:17,564
I'll just drop
that in the bin.

275
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:19,466
No, you will not!

276
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:21,568
I'd have nothing
for my supper.

277
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,771
Here it is.

278
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,476
- The 1715 Land Treaty.
- The what?

279
00:17:30,578 --> 00:17:32,012
You've not heard of it?

280
00:17:32,013 --> 00:17:35,449
It was drawn up amongst
the MacDonald chieftains

281
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,785
<i>to ensure
all ancestral land</i>

282
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:39,486
stayed within
our hands.

283
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:41,622
Sounds fascinating,

284
00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:44,524
but this isn't really a good
moment for a history lesson.

285
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:47,895
I'm just coming
to the interesting part.

286
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:51,098
"If the laird ever has the need
to sell off acreage,

287
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:55,236
then any other MacDonald,"
such as myself,

288
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:59,673
"could invoke the right
to buy the entire estate. "

289
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:03,277
Which means what?

290
00:18:03,278 --> 00:18:06,613
You have to sell us
Glenbogle.

291
00:18:06,614 --> 00:18:09,984
( scoffing ) This is some
sort of a hoax, right?

292
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:12,019
I've researched
every last detail.

293
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,722
- Who'd take something like that seriously these days?
- I do.

294
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:20,427
Have you any idea what an
estate like this would cost?

295
00:18:20,428 --> 00:18:23,430
I have a rather large
inheritance.

296
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:26,400
My family were very big
in offal products.

297
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:28,468
But we're talking
serious money.

298
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:29,870
Aye.

299
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:31,939
You're not
a surveyor then?

300
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,441
Oh, I still work.

301
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:37,444
Idle hands are
the devil's plaything.

302
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,150
And I daresay I'll find plenty to keep
us busy once we're settled in here.

303
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:45,886
Right, that's it, I've
heard enough. Go on, get out.

304
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,721
Well, if that's
what you want,

305
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:50,724
but you'll be seeing
us again soon enough.

306
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:52,392
I wouldn't
bet on it.

307
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:54,061
I'll show you out.

308
00:18:56,497 --> 00:18:59,066
Your copy.
Come along, Morag.

309
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:12,446
Another?

310
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:14,748
Love to, but I'd
better order a taxi.

311
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:17,651
Taxi? more chance
of flying.

312
00:19:17,652 --> 00:19:19,653
Listen, there's
a settee in there,

313
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:21,989
it's not much but
you're welcome to it.

314
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,059
- Sure?
- I wouldn't offer if I wasn't.

315
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,495
Well, beats sitting
in a room by yourself.

316
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:34,768
You know where the best
malt I ever tasted came from?

317
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:37,071
- The highlands, surely.
- No.

318
00:19:37,072 --> 00:19:38,805
The Orkneys, Isla?

319
00:19:38,806 --> 00:19:40,774
- Japan.
- Get away.

320
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:43,210
Mind you, I hadn't had
a drink in six months.

321
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:45,279
That would
account for it.

322
00:19:46,714 --> 00:19:50,851
So, what line
are you in?

323
00:19:50,852 --> 00:19:52,719
Anything and everything.

324
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,923
I've made and lost a great
deal of money in my time.

325
00:19:55,924 --> 00:19:58,825
Managed to hold onto a
chuck this time round, though

326
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:01,395
and then hit the road.

327
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,933
What, you just hit
the road?

328
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:09,403
Yeah. I've been around,
seen a lot of places.

329
00:20:09,404 --> 00:20:11,939
Funny thing is, I've
never been here before.

330
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,174
So, where do you
call home?

331
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:18,279
Right now, it's the back of the bike.

332
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,814
And when your
journey's over?

333
00:20:23,084 --> 00:20:25,052
Wherever it takes me.

334
00:20:31,993 --> 00:20:34,895
You have a visitor, my lord.

335
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:36,997
Probably not
a very welcome one.

336
00:20:36,998 --> 00:20:39,667
I came to apologize for
what I said this morning.

337
00:20:39,668 --> 00:20:42,536
It's already forgotten. Would
you like a glass of sherry?

338
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:45,105
Yes, thank you,
just a small one.

339
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:46,974
I didn't want us
to fall out,

340
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,342
not with everything else
that's happening.

341
00:20:49,343 --> 00:20:52,146
About the estate, you mean?
Hasn't Archie told you?

342
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:54,381
We've struck a deal,
your worries are over.

343
00:20:54,382 --> 00:20:57,918
No, Kilwillie, they might
have only just begun.

344
00:21:00,121 --> 00:21:03,023
<i>- Liz: it's lovely to meet you, Maureen.
- Irene.</i>

345
00:21:03,024 --> 00:21:05,125
Not often he brings
a lassie back for tea,

346
00:21:05,126 --> 00:21:07,594
- is it, Duncan?
- No, auntie.

347
00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:09,362
What was the name
of that last one?

348
00:21:09,363 --> 00:21:11,498
Skinny wee thing,
covered in freckles.

349
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:14,001
- Jennifer Connor.
- Aye, that's it.

350
00:21:14,002 --> 00:21:16,070
I'd high hopes
for the two of you.

351
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:19,807
She was six,

352
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:22,642
and I was seven.

353
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:26,413
So... should I be
looking for a new hat?

354
00:21:26,414 --> 00:21:30,150
- Do you need one?
- Well, if there's an event in the offing.

355
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:31,885
Event?

356
00:21:31,886 --> 00:21:34,154
One that involves bells.

357
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:37,557
What, me and Duncan?

358
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:40,127
You are round
for your tea.

359
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:42,429
This is the 21st century.

360
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,798
We're not about to trade
lifelong commitment

361
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,834
for a slice
of jam sponge.

362
00:21:46,835 --> 00:21:48,802
<i>Are we?</i>

363
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:53,273
I just thought
it would be a good idea

364
00:21:53,274 --> 00:21:56,309
if you two got to know
each other, that's all.

365
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,179
I see, and here's
me thinking

366
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,414
I might be hearing
the patter of tiny feet.

367
00:22:03,517 --> 00:22:05,552
Why?
Are the mice back?

368
00:22:05,553 --> 00:22:08,421
I can't buy it because
of a 300-year-old treaty?

369
00:22:08,422 --> 00:22:10,190
That's preposterous.

370
00:22:10,191 --> 00:22:12,826
We'll see. But I'm
afraid your rescue attempt

371
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,461
might have been
in vain.

372
00:22:14,462 --> 00:22:16,363
Is there any other way
I can help?

373
00:22:16,364 --> 00:22:18,431
I don't see how,

374
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:21,268
but all suggestions
are very welcome.

375
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:23,703
Then I'll put on
my thinking cap forthwith.

376
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:27,107
- Friends again?
- Oh, yes.

377
00:22:27,108 --> 00:22:29,309
I'd better get back.

378
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,779
<i>Nil desperandum.</i>

379
00:22:34,983 --> 00:22:38,418
I don't know where
these cobwebs come from.

380
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:40,254
More sherry,
Mrs. MacDonald?

381
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:42,956
No thank you, and I'll see myself out.

382
00:22:45,526 --> 00:22:49,296
McGregor: These are the
estates covered by the treaty

383
00:22:49,297 --> 00:22:50,964
and as you can see,

384
00:22:50,965 --> 00:22:53,767
Glenbogle is indeed
one of them.

385
00:22:53,768 --> 00:22:56,837
- Is it genuine then?
- Very much so.

386
00:22:56,838 --> 00:23:00,040
When it was drawn up,
land was everything.

387
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,042
Lose the smallest piece

388
00:23:02,043 --> 00:23:04,077
and it was a sign
of weakness and failure.

389
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:05,879
And so you'd also
lose face

390
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,548
in front of the other
great landowning families.

391
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:10,417
I can think
of worse things.

392
00:23:10,418 --> 00:23:12,886
Yes, but more importantly,
it meant that the laird

393
00:23:12,887 --> 00:23:15,388
who needed to make the sale
could no longer be trusted

394
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:17,224
with the rest
of what he owned.

395
00:23:17,225 --> 00:23:19,259
Whatever
the circumstances?

396
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,795
They were very
unforgiving times.

397
00:23:21,796 --> 00:23:25,098
Yes, but that was then and this
is now. It can't be valid today.

398
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:27,500
It's a precedent
that's never been tested.

399
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:31,171
There's a chance it could still be
considered legally binding by a court.

400
00:23:31,172 --> 00:23:33,640
Even if we had no idea
that it existed?

401
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:36,176
Ignorance, I'm afraid,
is no excuse.

402
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:40,547
So, what do we do now?

403
00:23:40,548 --> 00:23:43,650
Possession is 9/10ths
of the law-

404
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:47,654
so I'd advise selling to Lord
Kilwillie as speedily as possible.

405
00:23:47,655 --> 00:23:50,657
Once that pocket of land is his
and you've paid the death duties,

406
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:52,425
there'll be very little
Greg can do.

407
00:24:00,735 --> 00:24:02,736
Kilwillie? I presume
there's a reason

408
00:24:02,737 --> 00:24:05,005
why you're looking
so pleased with yourself.

409
00:24:05,006 --> 00:24:07,607
Come with me
and you'll find out.

410
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,311
Kilwillie,
what's happening?

411
00:24:12,646 --> 00:24:16,116
All aboard
the skylark.

412
00:24:16,117 --> 00:24:18,385
Oh, a picnic,

413
00:24:18,386 --> 00:24:20,053
what a wonderful
surprise.

414
00:24:20,054 --> 00:24:21,621
I thought you needed
cheering up.

415
00:24:21,622 --> 00:24:24,157
Kilwillie, I've got
the contract for you.

416
00:24:24,158 --> 00:24:27,361
- Not a good moment.
- All I need is a signature.

417
00:24:27,362 --> 00:24:29,963
I make it a rule never
to commit on an empty stomach.

418
00:24:29,964 --> 00:24:31,798
<i>Especially not
this early</i>

419
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,067
when who knows what
the day may bring.

420
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:37,837
<i>- Archie!
- ( boat motor starts )</i>

421
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:39,439
You'd better
come here.

422
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,548
Okay.

423
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:50,683
- Did he sign?
- Archie: Not yet.

424
00:24:50,684 --> 00:24:52,219
Then it's too late.

425
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,955
Greg MacDonald's had an
emergency injunction granted.

426
00:24:54,956 --> 00:24:57,925
As of 10 minutes ago, there's
a block on your land sale.

427
00:24:57,926 --> 00:25:00,693
- So we can't sell to Kilwillie?
- Nor to anybody else.

428
00:25:00,694 --> 00:25:04,331
- Then the death duties won't get paid.
- I need hardly remind you

429
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:07,301
that the consequences of that
are potentially disastrous.

430
00:25:07,302 --> 00:25:10,304
- Where can I find him?
- Greg? Staying in the village

431
00:25:10,305 --> 00:25:12,406
at the Glenbogle
Rose Guest House.

432
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:15,042
<i>- Right.
- Lexie: Where are you going?</i>

433
00:25:15,043 --> 00:25:16,910
Where do you think?

434
00:25:19,514 --> 00:25:21,381
Kilwillie: Do you want some more wine?

435
00:25:21,382 --> 00:25:23,683
Molly: Just a little. Thank you.

436
00:25:23,684 --> 00:25:26,686
Now, what's next,
I wonder?

437
00:25:26,687 --> 00:25:29,022
Oh, I've had
enough, really.

438
00:25:29,023 --> 00:25:31,291
This is the special
of the day.

439
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:33,260
Indulge me, Molly.

440
00:25:42,336 --> 00:25:43,803
Kilwillie?

441
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,176
I'm not a chap who finds
this sort of thing easy,

442
00:25:49,177 --> 00:25:52,011
but oh, Molly,

443
00:25:52,012 --> 00:25:53,680
I'd like to marry you.

444
00:25:57,151 --> 00:26:00,120
I really don't know
what to say.

445
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:03,690
Well, "yes" would
be rather nice.

446
00:26:03,691 --> 00:26:06,159
I know your feelings
aren't the same as mine-

447
00:26:07,795 --> 00:26:11,064
but over the years,
perhaps you might...

448
00:26:11,065 --> 00:26:14,501
grow to love me.
A bit.

449
00:26:16,337 --> 00:26:18,972
This really isn't
the right time.

450
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:21,941
Oh, but it is. Don't you see
it's exactly the right time?

451
00:26:21,942 --> 00:26:24,111
It occurred to me
yesterday after you'd left,

452
00:26:24,112 --> 00:26:26,179
if you marry me
I'd be family

453
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,781
and my money could help
you keep Glenbogle.

454
00:26:28,782 --> 00:26:31,585
But I thought it was the
land that you were after.

455
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:35,655
I'd rather have you,
as my wife.

456
00:26:35,656 --> 00:26:38,758
I really believe
you mean it.

457
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:41,294
I don't think for a minute
I'd ever replace Hector,

458
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:43,663
but we both know what
the estate meant to him.

459
00:26:43,664 --> 00:26:45,765
And we can save it,

460
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:48,235
if you- if you
would just consider

461
00:26:48,236 --> 00:26:50,370
taking me
as your husband.

462
00:26:52,373 --> 00:26:53,873
I need some time

463
00:26:53,874 --> 00:26:57,910
to think it over.

464
00:26:57,911 --> 00:27:01,047
Expected to find us in
some fancy hotel, I suppose.

465
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:04,184
But a bed and hot food,
that's all we need.

466
00:27:04,185 --> 00:27:07,420
Well then, why
do you want Glenbogle?

467
00:27:07,421 --> 00:27:11,158
It deserves to be in the hands
of someone who respects tradition.

468
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:12,925
And you think
that I don't?

469
00:27:12,926 --> 00:27:15,529
It's been my family's
home for generations.

470
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,331
But you're ready
to sell bits of it off.

471
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:20,900
- I have no choice.
- Don't give me that.

472
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:23,236
I've tried
every other option.

473
00:27:23,237 --> 00:27:25,472
Like your new-fangled
wildlife park?

474
00:27:25,473 --> 00:27:28,107
And the folk you let
up to visit it?

475
00:27:28,108 --> 00:27:32,546
<i>- if you mean our visitors, they're what keep us going.
- Not once I'm laird.</i>

476
00:27:32,547 --> 00:27:35,715
<i>- You can't just shut the place to the public.
- why not?</i>

477
00:27:35,716 --> 00:27:37,717
<i>I've no need
of their money.</i>

478
00:27:37,718 --> 00:27:40,253
But a lot of people
living round here do.

479
00:27:40,254 --> 00:27:42,622
<i>Their livelihoods
would be in your hands.</i>

480
00:27:42,623 --> 00:27:44,691
Being the laird,
it's not just a title,

481
00:27:44,692 --> 00:27:46,726
but there are obligations
that go with it.

482
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:52,865
He has a fair point.

483
00:27:52,866 --> 00:27:57,070
You've had your chance. I'll
run the place as I think fit.

484
00:27:58,673 --> 00:28:02,041
- This injunction won't change anything.
- Brave words.

485
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:05,812
I think it will, once the interest
on those death duties starts accruing.

486
00:28:05,813 --> 00:28:08,548
- Unless I pay them.
- Which we both know you can't.

487
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:11,218
<i>And I'll make sure
that any court case</i>

488
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:13,220
<i>is as drawn out
as possible.</i>

489
00:28:13,221 --> 00:28:16,089
<i>Ultimately, you could
be left with nothing.</i>

490
00:28:17,725 --> 00:28:20,360
That is unless you decide
to make it easy on yourself,

491
00:28:20,361 --> 00:28:22,295
and I could buy it
from you now.

492
00:28:22,296 --> 00:28:24,297
You still don't
get it, do you?

493
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:26,933
This isn't just about
me, I can't give in.

494
00:28:28,202 --> 00:28:30,670
In that case,

495
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:32,939
may the better man win.

496
00:28:38,846 --> 00:28:41,013
So, just when
we thought

497
00:28:41,014 --> 00:28:42,982
things couldn't
get any worse...

498
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,086
that settles it
then.

499
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:53,360
That's marvelous.
Isn't it, Badger?

500
00:28:53,361 --> 00:28:55,695
Yes, my lord.
Wonderful.

501
00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:57,997
Champagne, I think.
The '73.

502
00:28:57,998 --> 00:29:01,501
But I thought we were saving
that for a special occasion.

503
00:29:01,502 --> 00:29:05,272
- Well, this is it!
- If you say so, my lord.

504
00:29:05,273 --> 00:29:07,774
None for me,
thank you, Badger.

505
00:29:07,775 --> 00:29:09,776
Surely a toast
to our future.

506
00:29:09,777 --> 00:29:12,612
I must get back, tell
them all the good news.

507
00:29:12,613 --> 00:29:14,681
You're right,
of course.

508
00:29:14,682 --> 00:29:16,683
And after all,

509
00:29:16,684 --> 00:29:18,685
we'll be popping
corks together

510
00:29:18,686 --> 00:29:20,654
for many years
to come.

511
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:31,531
And if the worst does happen,
then you might have to find

512
00:29:31,532 --> 00:29:34,734
- other jobs.
- What would I do?

513
00:29:34,735 --> 00:29:36,469
It probably won't
come to that.

514
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,539
I just thought I ought
to tell you how we stand.

515
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,641
Thanks, it's appreciated.

516
00:29:41,642 --> 00:29:44,311
<i>Archie, I think your
problems might be over.</i>

517
00:29:44,312 --> 00:29:46,713
I'm going to marry
Kilwillie.

518
00:29:48,516 --> 00:29:50,450
But you can't
really be serious.

519
00:29:50,451 --> 00:29:52,084
It's the perfect
solution.

520
00:29:52,085 --> 00:29:54,788
He's got lots of money.
Glenbogle will be rescued

521
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:58,658
and, well, being lady Kilwillie
can't be all that bad.

522
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:00,360
I wouldn't put my last pound on it.

523
00:30:00,361 --> 00:30:02,362
Well, look, look how long
we've struggled.

524
00:30:02,363 --> 00:30:04,397
This will secure
all our futures.

525
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:05,765
Yes, but at
what cost?

526
00:30:05,766 --> 00:30:08,134
There isn't one.
Everybody gets what they want.

527
00:30:08,135 --> 00:30:10,236
Except you. You'd be
sacrificing your happiness.

528
00:30:10,237 --> 00:30:13,105
- Archie's right.
- I'm sorry, I don't agree.

529
00:30:13,106 --> 00:30:14,774
I won't let
you do it.

530
00:30:14,775 --> 00:30:17,344
My mind's made up.
You can't stop me now.

531
00:30:24,452 --> 00:30:27,754
So, what do we do now?

532
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:30,089
I haven't got a clue.
I'll tell you one thing,

533
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,959
she's not gonna walk up the
aisle with Kilwillie to save us.

534
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,128
- I agree.
- I've got an idea.

535
00:30:56,717 --> 00:30:59,052
Well now, Hector.

536
00:31:01,722 --> 00:31:05,224
I think this could be the end
of Glenbogle as we know it.

537
00:31:08,495 --> 00:31:11,197
<i>Golly?</i>

538
00:31:11,198 --> 00:31:14,067
I thought it was you.

539
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:16,169
Aye, aye.

540
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:21,507
Morag.

541
00:31:21,508 --> 00:31:23,142
<i>- Hello?
- Can we talk?</i>

542
00:31:23,143 --> 00:31:26,880
Yes, but if you're
who I think you are,

543
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:28,481
I can't do
much to help.

544
00:31:28,482 --> 00:31:30,817
But surely you can't agree
with what Greg's doing?

545
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:32,686
He's my husband.

546
00:31:32,687 --> 00:31:36,189
I love him,
despite his faults.

547
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,659
- This is his dream.
- But is it what you want, though?

548
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,597
He thinks Glenbogle should be kept as
a monument to the glory of the clan.

549
00:31:43,598 --> 00:31:46,800
When it's between them and
me, I'm used to coming second.

550
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:48,935
I suppose neither of us
could have known

551
00:31:48,936 --> 00:31:51,037
what we were letting
ourselves in for.

552
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:54,107
<i>- Marrying into this family.
- But I didn't.</i>

553
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:58,177
- Eh?
- I'm the MacDonald.

554
00:31:58,178 --> 00:32:00,580
When Greg married me,
he took my name.

555
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:07,487
Don't know why I didn't think
of looking in churchyards before.

556
00:32:10,224 --> 00:32:12,092
Is that it?

557
00:32:13,293 --> 00:32:15,895
Grandmother.

558
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:17,897
The last of the Rosses.

559
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:20,133
According to
the gravedigger there.

560
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:23,770
- I remember her now.
- Really?

561
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:26,072
She used to have
an apple tree in her garden.

562
00:32:26,073 --> 00:32:28,508
When I was a wee boy
I used to just help myself,

563
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:30,810
until she gave me
a thick ear.

564
00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:34,047
She never stood
for any nonsense, Mrs. Ross.

565
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,816
Apparently, she died
a very lonely old lady.

566
00:32:38,218 --> 00:32:41,187
- I didn't know.
- He told me.

567
00:32:41,188 --> 00:32:45,125
She worked on the Tavistock
Estate all her life.

568
00:32:45,126 --> 00:32:47,426
Then, when they sold it,

569
00:32:47,427 --> 00:32:51,330
the rest of her family and
her few friends moved away.

570
00:32:51,331 --> 00:32:54,100
Well, they had to, there
was no other work round here.

571
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,905
- But not her though?
- No.

572
00:32:58,906 --> 00:33:01,741
She reckoned she was
too old to up sticks.

573
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,279
So... that's it then,

574
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,883
you don't have any living
relatives in the area?

575
00:33:09,884 --> 00:33:12,952
Nope, that's it.

576
00:33:12,953 --> 00:33:15,121
The end of my search.

577
00:33:19,727 --> 00:33:22,595
Time to be moving on.
Again.

578
00:33:29,704 --> 00:33:31,771
Don't say anything. I
just want you to listen.

579
00:33:31,772 --> 00:33:34,674
- But-
- please.

580
00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:36,375
There's no easy way
to say this

581
00:33:36,376 --> 00:33:39,245
and, for the time being, I
don't want it going any further.

582
00:33:39,246 --> 00:33:41,147
What?

583
00:33:41,148 --> 00:33:43,549
I'm pregnant.

584
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:46,786
I- I'm gonna
be a dad?

585
00:33:46,787 --> 00:33:49,689
- No.
- But you just said-

586
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,758
it's not yours.

587
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:53,526
I don't understand.

588
00:33:53,527 --> 00:33:55,528
It can't be.

589
00:33:55,529 --> 00:33:57,764
We haven't been together
long enough.

590
00:33:57,765 --> 00:34:00,066
So, you've been seeing
somebody else?

591
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:02,869
Before I came here.

592
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,439
Isn't there a tiny
chance it might be mine?

593
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,975
I'm sorry.

594
00:34:14,982 --> 00:34:18,317
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

595
00:34:35,236 --> 00:34:39,605
I must be the world's
luckiest man,

596
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:41,274
hmm, Badger?

597
00:34:41,275 --> 00:34:44,778
Mmm. Your crackers,
my lord.

598
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,015
Now, the honeymoon.
Caribbean or the Med?

599
00:34:49,016 --> 00:34:51,117
It does rather depend
on the time of year,

600
00:34:51,118 --> 00:34:53,853
but we shouldn't leave it
too long to tie the knot.

601
00:34:53,854 --> 00:34:55,855
And on the day itself,

602
00:34:55,856 --> 00:34:59,358
I felt if we could just keep it down to 300 guests
- each.

603
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,829
Much more than that, it
all gets a bit out of hand.

604
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,397
Whatever you think.

605
00:35:04,398 --> 00:35:07,466
Wedding car?
The Bentley.

606
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:10,703
Or we could stretch
to a limousine.

607
00:35:10,704 --> 00:35:12,338
I really don't mind.

608
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:15,308
No, that was a joke.
Stretch limousine.

609
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:17,710
Oh, yes, very amusing.


610
00:35:17,711 --> 00:35:19,779
It makes us laugh,
eh, Badger?

611
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,182
On a regular basis,
your lordship.

612
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:26,019
You'll get to know my
sense of humor, my dear.

613
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,823
And all my little
ways and habits.

614
00:35:29,824 --> 00:35:32,458
All right, Badger,
you can leave us.

615
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:34,093
Yes, your lordship.

616
00:35:34,094 --> 00:35:37,430
Only I was wondering
if I should

617
00:35:37,431 --> 00:35:39,933
- air a spare room?
- For what reason?

618
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:42,302
Some engaged couples
have a more

619
00:35:42,303 --> 00:35:44,570
<i>- modern outlook-
- right, point taken.</i>

620
00:35:44,571 --> 00:35:47,106
Actually, I'll be
going home...

621
00:35:47,107 --> 00:35:49,943
<i>tonight.</i>

622
00:35:49,944 --> 00:35:52,611
Oh, right.

623
00:35:52,612 --> 00:35:55,915
Well, absolutely,
whatever you say.

624
00:36:01,288 --> 00:36:03,256
<i>( door closes )</i>

625
00:36:12,399 --> 00:36:15,634
<i>- Mother?
- Archie, you're still up.</i>

626
00:36:15,635 --> 00:36:18,004
So, how was
your evening?

627
00:36:18,005 --> 00:36:20,673
- Oh, fine.
- No, it wasn't.

628
00:36:20,674 --> 00:36:23,442
I had a thoroughly
enjoyable evening.

629
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:25,411
So, why do you
look so down?

630
00:36:27,915 --> 00:36:30,816
How do you think it makes
me feel seeing you like this?

631
00:36:30,817 --> 00:36:33,052
<i>- it'll get better.
- You don't know that.</i>

632
00:36:33,053 --> 00:36:35,889
It's me that's failed, why
should you have to suffer?

633
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:38,524
Oh, Archie,
you haven't failed.

634
00:36:38,525 --> 00:36:40,894
As much as I loved
your father,

635
00:36:40,895 --> 00:36:43,029
we both know that
this place was in

636
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,431
even more of a mess
before you came back.

637
00:36:45,432 --> 00:36:48,301
And he loved you, too.

638
00:36:48,302 --> 00:36:51,637
What do you think he'd make
of what you're doing now?

639
00:36:53,507 --> 00:36:55,308
He'd understand.

640
00:36:55,309 --> 00:36:59,212
No, he'd want you
to be happy,

641
00:36:59,213 --> 00:37:01,414
but you won't be
if you do this

642
00:37:01,415 --> 00:37:04,350
and neither
will Kilwillie.

643
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:06,986
It's not fair
on either of you.

644
00:37:09,489 --> 00:37:11,991
Maybe-

645
00:37:11,992 --> 00:37:14,527
maybe I'll speak
to him in the morning.

646
00:37:35,215 --> 00:37:36,716
( clears throat )

647
00:37:37,851 --> 00:37:41,053
Oh, Molly,
back so soon?

648
00:37:41,054 --> 00:37:42,722
Come sit down.

649
00:37:42,723 --> 00:37:44,691
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

650
00:37:44,692 --> 00:37:47,259
- I can't stay.
- I'll be in the pantry

651
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,629
if you need me,
your lordship.

652
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:53,433
I was thinking of popping over to
see if you fancied a spot of luncheon.

653
00:37:53,434 --> 00:37:55,835
- I'm not hungry.
- Much the same myself.

654
00:37:55,836 --> 00:37:57,804
I could only manage
three rashers

655
00:37:57,805 --> 00:38:00,206
and a half of round of
black pudding this morning.

656
00:38:00,207 --> 00:38:02,408
It's the excitement,
that's what it'll be.

657
00:38:02,409 --> 00:38:04,744
Kilwillie,

658
00:38:04,745 --> 00:38:06,746
I'm sorry,

659
00:38:06,747 --> 00:38:09,716
but I've changed my mind.
I can't marry you.

660
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:13,919
Well...

661
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,122
it's just a touch
of nerves, that's all.

662
00:38:17,123 --> 00:38:20,092
No doubt I'll be getting
butterflies, too.

663
00:38:20,093 --> 00:38:22,027
I'm afraid I mean it.

664
00:38:23,163 --> 00:38:25,130
No, you don't.

665
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:29,402
You're a good man,
Kilwillie,

666
00:38:29,403 --> 00:38:32,071
but if I were to become lady Kilwillie,

667
00:38:32,072 --> 00:38:33,973
<i>it would be
for your money,</i>

668
00:38:33,974 --> 00:38:36,141
and that's no basis
for a marriage.

669
00:38:36,142 --> 00:38:38,378
Isn't it?

670
00:38:38,379 --> 00:38:40,580
Well, not in my book.

671
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:45,017
I'm willing to risk it
if you are.

672
00:38:46,219 --> 00:38:48,954
But I'm not.

673
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:54,727
I see.

674
00:38:56,296 --> 00:38:58,564
Well, you can't blame
a chap for trying.

675
00:39:03,804 --> 00:39:05,571
Oh, no.

676
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:09,275
No, no you keep it. It'll only
remind me of what might have been.

677
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:11,577
Please.

678
00:39:17,017 --> 00:39:19,285
We can still stay
friends, can't we?

679
00:39:21,254 --> 00:39:23,456
I was rather hoping
you'd say that.

680
00:39:49,282 --> 00:39:52,084
Another cup, my lord?

681
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,320
No thank you, Badger.

682
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:56,522
You can take it away.

683
00:39:59,025 --> 00:40:02,394
I know it must be small
consolation, my lord,

684
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,531
but you've always
got me.

685
00:40:05,532 --> 00:40:08,634
And a truer servant
no man could wish for.

686
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,673
Maybe I should just be
content with my lot.

687
00:40:15,442 --> 00:40:18,478
I can't imagine a woman being
more capable in the kitchen,

688
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:20,613
or neater with
a needle and thread.

689
00:40:20,614 --> 00:40:22,782
I'm pretty nifty
with a duster, too.

690
00:40:24,585 --> 00:40:28,153
Now, if you'll excuse me, my
lord, I have your bath to draw.

691
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:31,824
Ducks or battleships?

692
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:34,293
Why don't you chose?

693
00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:38,531
Very good, my lord.

694
00:40:48,575 --> 00:40:50,142
Here we go.

695
00:40:50,143 --> 00:40:52,812
- You sure about this?
- Absolutely.

696
00:40:55,716 --> 00:40:58,050
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

697
00:41:11,498 --> 00:41:13,499
You did
the right thing.

698
00:41:16,136 --> 00:41:18,804
But we're still no nearer
getting the money.

699
00:41:18,805 --> 00:41:21,407
Well, I did have
one idea.

700
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,345
I couldn't do it
without asking you first.

701
00:41:40,594 --> 00:41:42,562
How's that?

702
00:41:44,431 --> 00:41:46,165
Well done.

703
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:48,500
- That is terrific.
- Not bad.

704
00:41:53,473 --> 00:41:55,675
Greg,
it's Archie MacDonald.

705
00:41:55,676 --> 00:41:59,178
Why don't you come over?
I have a proposition for you.

706
00:42:04,952 --> 00:42:07,820
I wish for Archie
to keep Glenbogle.

707
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:38,784
Greg: I hope this isn't
another wasted trip.

708
00:42:38,785 --> 00:42:40,752
It's time we settled
this once and for all.

709
00:42:40,753 --> 00:42:43,656
- I couldn't agree more.
- Good, then I challenge you to a duel.

710
00:42:43,657 --> 00:42:46,725
- Sorry?
- My privilege as laird,

711
00:42:46,726 --> 00:42:49,328
as laid down in
the amendments to the treaty.

712
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:53,165
But there are no amendments.
I was meticulous in my research.

713
00:42:54,434 --> 00:42:56,468
So what's this?

714
00:43:00,139 --> 00:43:02,874
Any territorial disputes
within the clan

715
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:05,944
can be settled
by pistol or sword.

716
00:43:05,945 --> 00:43:09,815
So you win, Glenbogle's yours, I win,
and you never come back here again.

717
00:43:12,252 --> 00:43:13,919
You're mad!

718
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,855
Like I said, he can talk the
talk but when it comes down to it

719
00:43:16,856 --> 00:43:19,291
he just hasn't got what
it takes to be the laird.

720
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,193
What's that
supposed to mean?

721
00:43:21,194 --> 00:43:24,996
It's not about how much you're
worth, it's about respect and honor.

722
00:43:24,997 --> 00:43:27,766
<i>And ultimately, it means
being prepared to die</i>

723
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:30,202
to protect what's yours
and what you believe in.

724
00:43:30,203 --> 00:43:34,039
And if you're not ready to do that, then
you're not worthy of taking my place.

725
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,309
But then I shouldn't be surprised
when you're not even a MacDonald.

726
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:40,279
- I'm every bit the man you are.
- Then prove it.

727
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,814
- Right, I will.
- You will not.

728
00:43:42,815 --> 00:43:45,584
Do you think I'm going
to risk losing you

729
00:43:45,585 --> 00:43:47,753
for the sake
of some stupid quest?

730
00:43:47,754 --> 00:43:51,890
- You keep out of this, Morag.
- No! I've put up with enough. I'm not going to stand by

731
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:54,893
- and watch you get yourself killed.
- I'm not backing down.

732
00:43:56,696 --> 00:43:59,231
Well,
in that case...

733
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,834
I'm the MacDonald.

734
00:44:02,835 --> 00:44:05,036
So if there's going
to be a duel,

735
00:44:05,037 --> 00:44:08,006
it'll be me fighting it.

736
00:44:08,007 --> 00:44:11,176
- You can't.
- Yes, I can.

737
00:44:12,646 --> 00:44:15,180
Taking on a woman,
it wouldn't be right.

738
00:44:15,181 --> 00:44:17,182
<i>Greg:
In that case,</i>

739
00:44:17,183 --> 00:44:19,385
<i>I'll see you in court,</i>

740
00:44:19,386 --> 00:44:22,488
and you'll be made to give up
Glenbogle. Come away, Morag.

741
00:44:22,489 --> 00:44:24,623
Archie!

742
00:44:24,624 --> 00:44:26,525
We've got the money.

743
00:44:31,931 --> 00:44:34,500
<i>- How?
- Molly: Because of Golly and Lexie.</i>

744
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:40,572
It looks like we won't be
going to court after all.

745
00:44:40,573 --> 00:44:43,842
<i>And you don't
have to fight.</i>

746
00:44:43,843 --> 00:44:47,479
Yes, he will.
You can't back down now.

747
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,383
- You just did.
- But I didn't make the challenge.

748
00:44:51,384 --> 00:44:53,652
And I thought you
were prepared

749
00:44:53,653 --> 00:44:56,488
<i>to die for what you
believed in.</i>

750
00:44:58,991 --> 00:45:02,093
Pistols or swords?

751
00:45:05,965 --> 00:45:08,033
Remember,
10 paces a man.

752
00:45:10,136 --> 00:45:13,305
Greg, Duncan
will be your second.

753
00:45:18,678 --> 00:45:21,447
You're not really gonna go
through with this, are you?

754
00:45:21,448 --> 00:45:23,682
<i>Archie: He needs to be taught a lesson.</i>

755
00:45:23,683 --> 00:45:25,851
It wasn't supposed
to come to this.

756
00:45:25,852 --> 00:45:27,786
Just remember one thing,

757
00:45:27,787 --> 00:45:30,088
I love you.

758
00:45:40,299 --> 00:45:42,468
Are you both ready?

759
00:45:43,503 --> 00:45:45,771
Aye.

760
00:45:45,772 --> 00:45:48,173
As the challenge was made
by Archie MacDonald,

761
00:45:48,174 --> 00:45:50,509
his opponent will
take the first shot.

762
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:53,144
In your own time.

763
00:46:02,822 --> 00:46:05,758
<i>( Greg gasps )</i>

764
00:46:05,759 --> 00:46:09,194
- ( Molly, Lexie cheering )
- Golly: It's not over yet!

765
00:46:11,163 --> 00:46:13,131
Archie.

766
00:46:18,237 --> 00:46:20,205
I don't have
to do this.

767
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,247
Last chance.

768
00:46:35,054 --> 00:46:36,988
Okay, okay, you win.

769
00:46:36,989 --> 00:46:39,625
- Duncan.
- What?

770
00:46:39,626 --> 00:46:42,394
<i>- You have to take his place.
- do I?</i>

771
00:46:42,395 --> 00:46:44,362
<i>You're his second,
it's in the rules.</i>

772
00:46:48,968 --> 00:46:51,002
All right, fine.

773
00:46:51,003 --> 00:46:53,038
<i>For goodness sake, man,
it's over.</i>

774
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:55,507
I was joking.
What's the matter with you?

775
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:04,817
It's over, Greg,

776
00:47:04,818 --> 00:47:07,218
and I'm glad...

777
00:47:08,922 --> 00:47:12,357
<i>because it's you
I care about,</i>

778
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:15,060
not living in some
stupid pile.

779
00:47:15,061 --> 00:47:17,028
You're just saying that.

780
00:47:18,264 --> 00:47:20,732
I don't deserve you.

781
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:25,370
I won't argue with that.

782
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,542
As we're not buying
the estate,

783
00:47:32,144 --> 00:47:34,713
perhaps we could treat
ourselves to a taxi back.

784
00:47:35,849 --> 00:47:38,984
Wouldn't
you rather walk?

785
00:47:38,985 --> 00:47:41,587
- It's only eight miles.
- ( groans )

786
00:47:45,959 --> 00:47:48,861
- Golly: Well done, Archie.
- You're the real hero.

787
00:47:48,862 --> 00:47:51,162
I know how much
your home meant to you.

788
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:53,398
If you hadn't found
that document-

789
00:47:53,399 --> 00:47:56,201
ah, yes, well I didn't.
It was all Lexie's work.

790
00:47:56,202 --> 00:47:59,037
You didn't know that we had
a resident forger, did you?

791
00:47:59,038 --> 00:48:01,707
- Molly: I don't believe it!
- Greg did though-

792
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:03,775
fortunately.

793
00:48:03,776 --> 00:48:06,344
Doon Brae, it is
still your favorite

794
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:08,580
- part of the estate?
- It is, yes.

795
00:48:08,581 --> 00:48:11,416
You know the old
ruined cottage up there?

796
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:14,486
<i>It'll take a lot of work,
but it's yours if you want it.</i>

797
00:48:14,487 --> 00:48:16,321
Sounds good.

798
00:48:16,322 --> 00:48:18,824
One question though,
what if he hadn't missed?

799
00:48:18,825 --> 00:48:20,826
There was no
danger at all.

800
00:48:20,827 --> 00:48:22,828
I sent Duncan
to get the pistols-

801
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:25,463
I told him to put the
powder in, not the bullets.

802
00:48:25,464 --> 00:48:28,867
I knew you had
something up your sleeve.

803
00:48:28,868 --> 00:48:31,403
I forgot.

804
00:48:31,404 --> 00:48:33,171
What?

805
00:48:33,172 --> 00:48:34,806
You're kidding?

806
00:48:36,142 --> 00:48:38,644
You'd still
be safe enough.

807
00:48:38,645 --> 00:48:41,479
<i>These aren't accurate
at six feet</i>

808
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,249
and you were at least
15 yards apart.

809
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,952
I'm gonna aim at that
dead branch there.

810
00:48:49,022 --> 00:48:51,289
<i>( gunshot )</i>

811
00:48:56,362 --> 00:48:58,463
Archie!
