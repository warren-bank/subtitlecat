<i>( clattering )</i>

2
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,734
Fergal,

3
00:00:24,735 --> 00:00:26,470
how did you
get in?

4
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:28,538
The usual way,

5
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:30,540
through
the front door.

6
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,709
I'm not sure
if I approve of you

7
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,878
sneaking in here
and making me breakfast.

8
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:36,212
I know.

9
00:00:36,213 --> 00:00:38,482
I am the headmistress
of the local school.

10
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:40,083
<i>I've got my reputation
to think of.</i>

11
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:42,318
Sweetheart, we're five miles
from the nearest town

12
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:44,654
and hundreds of miles
from civilization.

13
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:46,656
Who's even going
to know I'm here?

14
00:00:46,657 --> 00:00:48,558
<i>( rapping on door )</i>

15
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,397
Good morning. I've got
two letters for you.

16
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:57,634
This one looks official, and
one for Fergal. Airmail, too.

17
00:00:57,635 --> 00:00:59,302
For Fergal?

18
00:00:59,303 --> 00:01:01,404
Seeing as he's here
all the time these days,

19
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:03,406
I thought I would
drop off his post.

20
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:05,208
Thank you, Craig.

21
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,477
So long.
So long, Fergal.

22
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:09,045
<i>Fergal:
So long, Craig.</i>

23
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,024
Okay.
So Craig knows.

24
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:23,727
It'll be all over
Glenbogle in half an hour.

25
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:26,496
Could go after him,
let his tires down.

26
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:29,833
What's wrong?

27
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:31,835
Who's it from?

28
00:01:31,836 --> 00:01:34,905
Education authority.

29
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:36,907
Are they onto us
already?

30
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:39,943
- They're actually shutting it.
- Shutting what?

31
00:01:39,944 --> 00:01:42,445
The school, Fergal.

32
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:44,915
They're closing down
my school.

33
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,516
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

34
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:23,553
<i>( low conversation within )</i>

35
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:27,991
<i>Man: I don't see why there has to be</i>

36
00:02:27,992 --> 00:02:30,827
a religious ceremony
involved.

37
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,568
They're still at it.
Did you not hear

38
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:41,471
what they were talking about
when you brought their coffee?

39
00:02:41,472 --> 00:02:44,975
- As Glenbogle housekeeper, I've taken
a vow of silence. - I hadn't noticed.

40
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:47,978
Actually, Archie's thinking
of having you committed.

41
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:49,913
<i>Just needs another
signature for the form.</i>

42
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:51,180
Is the minister
still here?

43
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:52,849
Yeah.
What's going on?

44
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,952
I shouldn't say, but I did
hear them mention marriage.

45
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:59,288
- I didn't like to eavesdrop.
- You're his mother.

46
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:01,224
You're meant
to eavesdrop.

47
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:03,593
<i>( door opens,
men laughing )</i>

48
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,980
Not at all, Archie. I look
forward to the big day.

49
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,682
See you Sunday.

50
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:45,969
Oh, Archie.
Hello. Hi.

51
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,305
I haven't seen a shifty bunch of
characters outside a police lineup.

52
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:51,174
Who, dear?
Us?

53
00:03:51,175 --> 00:03:54,844
I'm glad you're all here.
I have an announcement to make.

54
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:56,780
There's going to be
a wedding at Glenbogle.

55
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:01,517
Who's the lucky girl?

56
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:03,987
She's from Glasgow.
You don't know her.

57
00:04:03,988 --> 00:04:07,023
Archie, you are
a dark horse.

58
00:04:07,024 --> 00:04:08,892
I am delighted for you!

59
00:04:08,893 --> 00:04:10,727
When are your father and I
going to meet her?

60
00:04:12,963 --> 00:04:16,599
Wait, it's not me. I'm not
the one getting married.

61
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,602
Oh, well. You better start again, then.

62
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:22,872
It occurred to me that Glenbogle
would make a great venue for weddings.

63
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:25,075
<i>All we need is the
minister's permission.</i>

64
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:26,910
Ah, right.

65
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:28,978
We could go for a homely,
intimate affair.

66
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,514
Lexie could run the catering.
Mother could do the flowers.

67
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:35,551
Duncan could be factotum.
Golly could provide the game.

68
00:04:35,552 --> 00:04:37,553
Hector could look
after the car park.

69
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:39,956
That is
a fantastic idea!

70
00:04:39,957 --> 00:04:42,491
<i>Hear that?
Factotum.</i>

71
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,493
That's Latin
for "gofer. "

72
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:47,897
In fact, we have our first
couple arriving this afternoon.

73
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:50,700
- Already?
- Pamela McAlpine and Eric Morton

74
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:53,302
<i>from Glasgow. Apparently
they're rolling in it.</i>

75
00:04:53,303 --> 00:04:55,138
If we impress them,
and word gets around-

76
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,740
I'm off to shop
in my secateurs.

77
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:59,508
- I'm off to iron my kilt.
- Mind you take it off first.

78
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:01,644
Have you thought
about music?

79
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:05,414
Yes. Maybe
by special request.

80
00:05:07,051 --> 00:05:09,219
It's Scottish, Archie.
You need the pipes.

81
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,587
( snickering )

82
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:13,256
Not everyone likes
bagpipes, Golly.

83
00:05:13,257 --> 00:05:15,091
I could
educate them.

84
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:21,231
<i>( doorbell ringing )</i>

85
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:30,506
Hello.

86
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:33,009
- How are you?
- Unemployed.

87
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,478
Is Hector here?

88
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,815
They're closing down the
school at the end of the term.

89
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:40,917
They want to bus the kids
to the new big school

90
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:42,986
- at Glenmorriston.
- That's miles away.

91
00:05:42,987 --> 00:05:45,789
We're just on the edge
of the catchment area.

92
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,691
They've been talking about it but
I never believed it would happen.

93
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:50,193
Who would?
It's insane!

94
00:05:50,194 --> 00:05:51,494
We need Hector
at the meeting.

95
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:52,896
He's on the board
of governors.

96
00:05:52,897 --> 00:05:54,630
He'll be there,
and so will the laird.

97
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:56,732
I don't think your title
will count for much.

98
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:59,669
Fine, I'll come
as... Archie MacDonald.

99
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,637
We need all the help
we can get.

100
00:06:01,638 --> 00:06:03,539
They're sending down
some spin doctor

101
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,041
from the board
of education.

102
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:06,776
We'll hand him his head
in a basket.

103
00:06:06,777 --> 00:06:09,345
Whatever it takes,
Katrina.

104
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:10,479
Thanks.

105
00:06:16,486 --> 00:06:18,922
And you want me
to make up the numbers?

106
00:06:18,923 --> 00:06:20,623
I want you to make
your voice heard,

107
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:22,425
as a member
of the community.

108
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:24,727
I've only been here
a few months.

109
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:28,231
What are you building
the hide for, exactly?

110
00:06:28,232 --> 00:06:31,767
If the school closes, it'll
be empty most of the year.

111
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:34,503
I just...
I can't, okay?

112
00:06:34,504 --> 00:06:36,339
I have to disappear
for a few days.

113
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,007
- What for?
- It's important to me.

114
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:39,976
What's more important
than this?

115
00:06:39,977 --> 00:06:41,410
You'll be fine, okay?

116
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:44,480
One way or another,
things will work out.

117
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:49,319
I know how much
this means to you.

118
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,187
If I knew how little
it meant to you,

119
00:06:51,188 --> 00:06:53,122
I wouldn't have
bothered asking.

120
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:57,626
Katrina...

121
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,298
why can't these people just go to
Gretna Green like everyone else?

122
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:04,633
We're aiming for a rather
more upmarket clientele.

123
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,302
Never heard
of this chap Morton.

124
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:08,471
One of these nouveau
riche johnnies, I suppose-

125
00:07:08,472 --> 00:07:10,874
make their money out of
arms dealing and pornography.

126
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,709
We made ours from stealing sheep
and subjugating the peasants.

127
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,311
You've been spending
too much time

128
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:17,146
with that lefty
schoolteacher of yours.

129
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:20,884
Everyone ready?
Where's Golly?

130
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:23,719
<i>- ( bagpipes playing )
- Oh...</i>

131
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:28,992
( pipes whine )

132
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:33,196
It's never too early
to start their education.

133
00:07:33,197 --> 00:07:35,865
Golly, they specifically
asked for no pipes.

134
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:38,001
- And you agreed?
- The customer is always right.

135
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:41,404
- The customer's a cloth-eared
loon! - Put them back, please.

136
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:48,278
Remember, this could be
a real earner for Glenbogle.

137
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,446
The keynote
is intimate and...

138
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:51,747
sophisticated.

139
00:08:06,663 --> 00:08:08,998
Miss McAlpine,
welcome to Glenbogle.

140
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:10,934
You must be Archie.

141
00:08:10,935 --> 00:08:13,403
You've got the looks
to go with the voice.

142
00:08:13,404 --> 00:08:15,538
Duncan will help you
with your bags.

143
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:16,973
No need.
Eric's onto it.

144
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:18,474
- No, please.
- No, really.

145
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:21,210
He likes to keep busy.
This must be your staff.

146
00:08:22,512 --> 00:08:25,481
My family. Hector MacDonald, my father.

147
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:26,715
Delighted.

148
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:29,518
He's got a twinkle
in his eye.

149
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,355
I bet you're always chasing
after the maids, eh?

150
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:33,923
Certainly not.
At my age,

151
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:35,858
it's safer
to ambush them.

152
00:08:37,962 --> 00:08:40,629
- This is my mother.
- Molly MacDonald.

153
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,865
<i>Welcome to Glenbogle,
Ms. McAlpine.</i>

154
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:45,601
We promise you the
most delightful wedding.

155
00:08:45,602 --> 00:08:47,070
Oh, lovely.

156
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:50,806
But I'm not a "Ms. "
Just call me Pamela- ooh!

157
00:08:50,807 --> 00:08:52,308
Who is this?

158
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:54,643
I'm Golly, Miss McAlpine. The ghillie.

159
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:56,712
Oh. You look
after the fishing?

160
00:08:56,713 --> 00:08:58,414
Amongst
other duties, yes.

161
00:08:58,415 --> 00:08:59,849
I love the kilt.

162
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,452
If my luck's in,
the wind picks up,

163
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:05,221
I'll get to inspect
your tackle.

164
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:10,326
- Perhaps you'd like to...
- this way.

165
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:13,662
Certainly.

166
00:09:13,663 --> 00:09:16,699
"Upmarket
clientele," eh?

167
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,035
I know you think she's
a little... plainspoken.

168
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,170
"Plainspoken"? Her mind's like a midden,

169
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:23,072
and a mouth
like a highland bog.

170
00:09:23,073 --> 00:09:25,508
And I like her
already.

171
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:28,111
I started off with a
wee cafe in Garnet Hill.

172
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:30,079
All day breakfast.
That sort of thing.

173
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,148
And you expanded
from there?

174
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:33,849
Not really, no.

175
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,252
My uncle died and left me
a shedload of money.

176
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:38,821
Pamela's been my waitress
these past four years.

177
00:09:38,822 --> 00:09:40,856
Keeps the punters
on their toes.

178
00:09:40,857 --> 00:09:43,559
She's a terrible flirt,
but a heart of gold.

179
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,761
I never had the nerve
to pop the question

180
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:47,230
till my ship came in.

181
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:49,365
Who says money can't
buy you happiness, eh?

182
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:53,169
Tea up. And coffee,
and scones.

183
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,038
This is Lexie,
our housekeeper.

184
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,475
<i>- What will you be having?
- same as always, Lexie.</i>

185
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:02,811
- Lexie!
- That's my gawky wee girl.

186
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:05,214
Hello, mom.

187
00:10:05,215 --> 00:10:06,682
Mom?!

188
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:07,917
Surprise!

189
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:09,952
Good lord!

190
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:11,954
<i>- Sorry- - I heard
you got a job up here.</i>

191
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:13,856
I saw Archie's advert
and I thought,

192
00:10:13,857 --> 00:10:16,526
"that's the very place
I want to get married. "

193
00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:17,960
Oh, really?

194
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:20,696
We'll have to fit
a revolving door then, eh?

195
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:23,666
<i>Lexie,
I'm Eric.</i>

196
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,368
It's a joy
to meet you.

197
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:27,070
<i>I thought
you'd be younger.</i>

198
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:29,838
Aye, math was never
your strong point, honey.

199
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,308
You two must have lots
of catching up to do.

200
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,778
Not really, no.

201
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:38,214
<i>- Excuse me.
- Archie: Lexie...!</i>

202
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:43,319
Kids, hey?

203
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:46,956
Lexie?
Where are you going?

204
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:49,125
To slip into something
more comfortable,

205
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:50,960
like a taxi to Glasgow!

206
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:52,595
What is going on
between you?

207
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:55,398
- Have you got a week?
- Pamela and Eric are our guests.

208
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,567
We treat them with a
modicum of civility, okay?

209
00:10:57,568 --> 00:11:00,803
I am going to a meeting this evening.
I need you to look after them.

210
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:03,172
You want me to sit back
and think of Glenbogle?

211
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:05,274
- How hard can it be?
- You have no idea!

212
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,684
Molly: And here we
have the bridal suite.

213
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:18,020
Hector and I spent
our first night here

214
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:19,255
40 years ago now.

215
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:21,157
<i>Hardly used it since.</i>

216
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:24,160
Yes, it does smell
a little funny at first.

217
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:25,628
You're not kidding.

218
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:27,763
Not to worry.
A blast of fresh air,

219
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:29,432
and you'll
hardly notice it.

220
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,336
I'll try the one
in the bathroom.

221
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:39,108
On second thoughts,
it is rather chilly outside.

222
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:41,744
I'll fetch
some potpourri.

223
00:11:41,745 --> 00:11:42,945
Thank you.

224
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:48,083
Archie:
Sorry we're late.

225
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:50,085
Father couldn't decide
which hat to wear.

226
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:52,221
So long since I've been
to one of these things.

227
00:11:52,222 --> 00:11:54,890
The guy from the department
of education hasn't arrived yet.

228
00:11:54,891 --> 00:11:56,626
I've saved you
a seat, Hector.

229
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:03,699
Andy.
Andy McArdle.

230
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,735
Archie! Archie, you dog, how are you?

231
00:12:06,736 --> 00:12:09,438
I'd forgotten this was
your old stamping ground.

232
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:11,707
- Still is.
- What are you doing these days?

233
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,008
Not much.
I'm the laird.

234
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,511
- Oh, great.
- What about you?

235
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:17,012
Mr. McArdle
is the spin doctor

236
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:18,714
for the Department
of Education.

237
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:21,350
Head of Media
and Public Relations.

238
00:12:21,351 --> 00:12:22,918
Wow! Who'd have
thought it?

239
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,720
Jack and I were
at school together.

240
00:12:24,721 --> 00:12:27,089
- Jack?
- Short for Jackanory.

241
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,758
He used to tell the most
amazingly tall tales.

242
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,394
I can well
believe it.

243
00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:33,128
I've read
your press release.

244
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:36,098
Shall we
get started?

245
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:41,170
Man: Glenmorriston's 18 miles away.

246
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:43,639
You can't expect parents
to drive their children

247
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,808
there and back
every day.

248
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:49,044
The local council will be
providing a bus service-

249
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:51,780
- free of charge.
- ( crowd murmuring )

250
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:54,450
And what about their
friends from the village?

251
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:56,319
Their friends will
be going with them,

252
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,987
and they'll make new
friends at their new school.

253
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:01,324
Look, this is all
missing the point.

254
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:03,492
<i>The village
needs its school.</i>

255
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:06,028
It's the focal point
of our community.

256
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:08,397
Glenmorriston school
has better facilities,

257
00:13:08,398 --> 00:13:11,400
better resources,
more modern buildings.

258
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:13,636
Don't your children
deserve the best?

259
00:13:13,637 --> 00:13:16,339
Look, Jack-
Mr. McArdle,

260
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,908
our children are already
getting the best here at home.

261
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:24,046
You cannot ship them nearly 40
miles every day, not at their age.

262
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:27,550
You close the school, and soon
all the families will leave,

263
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:29,918
and all you'll have left here
is a ghost town.

264
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,854
Is that really what
your department wants?

265
00:13:31,855 --> 00:13:33,623
( murmuring )

266
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,026
Look, the decision's
not been written in stone.

267
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,762
<i>I'm here
to consult with you</i>

268
00:13:39,763 --> 00:13:42,898
and to pass your comments
on to the department.

269
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,835
Believe me, they'll receive
serious consideration.

270
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:54,810
That was great,
Archie.

271
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:58,113
Maureen and I might have a job
come September after all.

272
00:13:58,114 --> 00:14:00,182
I don't know if it'll
make any difference.

273
00:14:00,183 --> 00:14:01,550
It's got to.

274
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:04,287
You really did hand him
his head in a basket. Thanks.

275
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:07,055
I'll mention it in my sermon
Sunday, get the word around.

276
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:10,293
Good idea. Spread some much
needed panic and despondency.

277
00:14:10,294 --> 00:14:11,460
Minister: Sorry?

278
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:13,429
Let's hope they demolish
the place.

279
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,331
We could do
with a decent car park.

280
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:16,965
You're supposed
to be on our side.

281
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:20,002
It's time the local brats got out
of this bible-thumping backwater.

282
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:23,372
Every Sunday dragged off to church
and barracked about hell and damnation!

283
00:14:23,373 --> 00:14:25,741
No wonder they grow up
to be superstitious buffoons.

284
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:29,111
Do 'em good to get away
from all that religious twaddle!

285
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:31,580
I'll walk home.

286
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:34,517
I'm sorry, you'll have
to forgive my father.

287
00:14:34,518 --> 00:14:35,918
He likes to shock.

288
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,653
He's very good at it.

289
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:40,523
Perhaps, if you want to hold
weddings at the big house,

290
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:42,591
you should find
another minister.

291
00:14:57,374 --> 00:15:00,743
So... your name's
McAlpine now?

292
00:15:00,744 --> 00:15:02,812
Whirlwind romance.

293
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:04,647
Didn't work out.

294
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:06,148
So, what's new?

295
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:08,351
All that's
behind me now.

296
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:10,319
Let's forget
about the past, eh?

297
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,621
All I want is for my
friends at the wedding

298
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:14,390
to see my lovely
wee girl.

299
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:16,692
You inviting your
ex-boyfriends to the wedding?

300
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:18,994
We'll have to airlift
in supplies.

301
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:20,463
Don't be
like that, Lex.

302
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:22,765
It's gonna be a special
day for all of us.

303
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:24,533
A fresh start,
what do you say?

304
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:28,504
Look, I know I haven't
been much of a mother.

305
00:15:28,505 --> 00:15:30,806
I'm the only one
you've got, by the way.

306
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:33,376
I know
I've made mistakes.

307
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:36,311
Such as?

308
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:38,481
Not spending
enough time with you.

309
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:41,584
I mean, I tried.
It wasn't easy.

310
00:15:41,585 --> 00:15:44,086
God knows
I was away myself.

311
00:15:44,087 --> 00:15:46,489
And you always had to be
the center of attention.

312
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,357
- Me?
- Aye. This is gonna be

313
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:50,826
<i>my big day, and you can
be a part of it.</i>

314
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:53,496
I never wanted to be
the center of attention!

315
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:55,197
I just wanted to exist!

316
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:56,899
You spent more time
fixing your hair

317
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,233
than you did
talking to me.

318
00:15:58,234 --> 00:15:59,668
Don't start, Lex.

319
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:02,070
You nearly had me going there
for a minute.

320
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:04,206
Go ahead, forget the past.

321
00:16:04,207 --> 00:16:05,741
I wish I could.

322
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:09,945
Ah.

323
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:11,881
Can we discuss
the catering?

324
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:14,817
Yeah! We'll serve grass!
That's what cows eat!

325
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:17,219
I mean it! She's not
here to get married,

326
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,955
she's here to humiliate
me! I'm not gonna play!

327
00:16:19,956 --> 00:16:21,189
Where are
our guests?

328
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,659
I rather fancy being
appalled by Lexie's mother.

329
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,795
Yes, and perhaps
you could explain to me

330
00:16:25,796 --> 00:16:28,263
why the Reverend Mitchell
won't be marrying them?

331
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:31,099
You'll find another minister.
The hills are crawling with them.

332
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,001
It took me all morning
to persuade that one.

333
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:34,403
What have you got
against him?

334
00:16:34,404 --> 00:16:37,072
That pompous, sanctimonious
windbag? Nothing whatsoever.

335
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:39,007
Then you won't mind
apologising to him.

336
00:16:39,008 --> 00:16:40,709
Of course not.
I'll tell you what.

337
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,578
As soon as the loch
freezes over,

338
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:45,180
I'll skate across to his
church and say, "sorry. "

339
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:50,085
<i>( door closes )</i>

340
00:16:55,992 --> 00:16:57,560
<i>( bagpipes playing )</i>

341
00:17:05,602 --> 00:17:08,070
Oh, god...

342
00:17:14,644 --> 00:17:17,079
sorry, Archie.
Did I wake you?

343
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,214
Along with the rest
of the glen, yes.

344
00:17:19,215 --> 00:17:21,684
<i>It beats that today program, though, eh?</i>

345
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:24,987
Golly, I've told you. Our
guests cannot stand the bagpipes.

346
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:27,957
But they haven't heard them
in the proper context.

347
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,358
And they're not going to!

348
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,626
I can do requests.

349
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:32,895
Give me a tune.
Any thing you like.

350
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:35,230
Can you play
"far, far away"?

351
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,066
"Far, far away"?

352
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:39,602
Right.

353
00:17:39,603 --> 00:17:41,537
<i>Golly,
don't disappear.</i>

354
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:42,571
<i>Golly!</i>

355
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:47,943
I want one of the big, stripey tents

356
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:49,912
to cover
the whole garden,

357
00:17:49,913 --> 00:17:52,882
and I want an orchestra
that plays classical music-

358
00:17:52,883 --> 00:17:54,550
you know, Mozart,
James Galway,

359
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:55,851
that kind of thing.

360
00:17:55,852 --> 00:17:57,185
An orchestra?

361
00:17:57,186 --> 00:17:59,655
Archie, if you've
got it, flaunt it.

362
00:17:59,656 --> 00:18:02,024
And I want lilies
everywhere.

363
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:04,359
Pink and white.

364
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,928
I love the smell
of lilies.

365
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:07,997
They're not really
very common around here.

366
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:09,498
Don't worry about it.

367
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:12,067
I know a posh place in
Edinburgh that does them.

368
00:18:12,068 --> 00:18:13,268
Now, cars-

369
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:15,370
I want a fleet
of white Rolls-Royces

370
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:18,273
to pick up all our guests
from the railway station.

371
00:18:18,274 --> 00:18:20,108
And then,
when we leave...

372
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:22,711
I want it to be something
really spectacular.

373
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:24,212
Hot air balloon?

374
00:18:25,348 --> 00:18:27,115
That's brilliant.

375
00:18:27,116 --> 00:18:29,384
You're dead good
at this, Archie.

376
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:31,921
See, if I was just a
couple of years younger...

377
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:33,121
Pamela.

378
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:36,025
Relax.
I'm not married yet.

379
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:38,193
Have you discussed
the menu with Lexie?

380
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:40,095
No need. We're hiring the caterers.

381
00:18:40,096 --> 00:18:43,532
Anyway, Lexie will be far
too busy being my bridesmaid.

382
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:45,768
Bridesmaid? Have you
spoken to her about this?

383
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:47,002
No... I've tried.

384
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:49,838
She has a whole bag of
chips on her shoulder.

385
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,474
Actually, maybe if
you talked to her.

386
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:54,076
Oh, I don't think
it's really my place.

387
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:58,047
Go on, Archie.
Do it for me.

388
00:18:58,048 --> 00:19:01,183
How could she resist those
big brown eyes of yours?

389
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:02,885
What woman could?

390
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:05,821
All right,
I'll give it a go.

391
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:08,991
Good. Now, the minister's
all organised, is he?

392
00:19:08,992 --> 00:19:10,960
Yes, yes, of course.

393
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:13,662
Archie: I've already spoken
to the Reverend Mitchell,

394
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:16,098
but he suggested I try
to find somebody else.

395
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:18,467
I know it's not
in your parish, but...

396
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:20,936
right. Okay, thank you.
Goodbye.

397
00:19:20,937 --> 00:19:24,707
- How are you getting on?
- Oh, like a house on fire.

398
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:28,010
Am I imagining things, or does
father have it in for our minister?

399
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:29,444
Yes, he does rather.

400
00:19:29,445 --> 00:19:32,081
He hasn't spoken to him
since Jamie's funeral.

401
00:19:32,082 --> 00:19:34,617
Now, about the flowers
for the wedding...

402
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:36,518
the fuchsias are
just coming into bloom,

403
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,420
and they'll make
such a pretty bouquet.

404
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:41,790
The thing is, Pamela has
asked for orchids and lilies.

405
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,793
Archie, I can't possibly provide those.

406
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:48,296
She's already spoken
to a florist in Edinburgh.

407
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:50,365
Oh, very well.

408
00:19:50,366 --> 00:19:52,434
There will still be
plenty for you to do.

409
00:19:52,435 --> 00:19:55,004
You and Pamela seem to have
everything under control.

410
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:56,605
Why don't I just
leave you to it?

411
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:01,010
<i>( slams door )</i>

412
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,947
Archie...

413
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:08,517
I've just received this fax
from your friend Andrew McArdle.

414
00:20:08,518 --> 00:20:11,286
They had no intention
of listening to us.

415
00:20:11,287 --> 00:20:15,024
Blah blah blah...
"we regret to confirm

416
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:17,292
that the closure will
go ahead as planned. "

417
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:19,628
I'm so sorry.
What can I do?

418
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:22,564
You could ask everyone in the
house to join the campaign.

419
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:24,466
I would if they
were speaking to me.

420
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:26,769
- What's going on?
- You don't want to know.

421
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,905
- Yeah, I do.
- How's Fergal these days?

422
00:20:29,906 --> 00:20:31,907
If I could find him,
I'd tell you.

423
00:20:31,908 --> 00:20:34,143
You can always rely on
a man to let you down.

424
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:39,281
All right, boss.

425
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:40,582
Thank you.

426
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:45,253
Treacle tarts.

427
00:20:45,254 --> 00:20:46,955
I buy them
at the supermarket.

428
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:48,523
That's a long walk.

429
00:20:48,524 --> 00:20:51,226
Me and your mother got
together over one of those.

430
00:20:51,227 --> 00:20:53,295
I saw her sitting
out on the bridge,

431
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:56,531
looking down at the river.
Some guy had dumped her.

432
00:20:56,532 --> 00:20:58,266
I took her out
some treacle tart

433
00:20:58,267 --> 00:21:00,569
and said, "this'll glue
a broken heart together. "

434
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,838
She laughed. We got
talking for the first time.

435
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,907
Wasn't really gonna jump,
was she?

436
00:21:04,908 --> 00:21:07,342
Sometimes she's
a scared wee girl.

437
00:21:07,343 --> 00:21:09,244
Give her
another chance, Lexie.

438
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:11,780
<i>Carrying a grudge
will wear you out.</i>

439
00:21:11,781 --> 00:21:14,349
Oh. Should have known
I'd find you in here.

440
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,719
Just picking up
some tips from the chef.

441
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,921
Listen, I'll leave
you two girls to talk.

442
00:21:23,093 --> 00:21:25,293
He's a lovely guy.
You're very lucky.

443
00:21:25,294 --> 00:21:26,929
He's the lucky one.

444
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,332
I mean, finding someone
that really cares about you.

445
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,768
<i>- That's not easy.
- you would think that.</i>

446
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:35,070
I've never had any trouble finding men.

447
00:21:35,071 --> 00:21:37,639
No, it was keeping count
that was the hard part.

448
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,275
Can I help it if men
find me attractive?

449
00:21:40,276 --> 00:21:42,211
Like that cute
wee laird?

450
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:45,247
Archie? Just because he
lives amongst antiques

451
00:21:45,248 --> 00:21:47,515
doesn't mean he wants
to go off with one.

452
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:49,118
Ooh! I suppose
you're hoping

453
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:51,120
he'll stoke
your AGA one day.

454
00:21:51,121 --> 00:21:53,722
Well, I don't suppose
it hurts to dream.

455
00:21:53,723 --> 00:21:57,760
- Ooh! Get off me with that!
- It's for your dress.

456
00:21:57,761 --> 00:22:00,729
- What dress?
- Your bridesmaid's dress.

457
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,265
Looks like you take
after your father.

458
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:05,134
Still, we'll save
on material.

459
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:07,069
If you think I'm putting on some frock

460
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,804
for your tacky
wee circus-

461
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:10,906
you're not turning up
like that.

462
00:22:10,907 --> 00:22:12,808
I'm not turning up
at all.

463
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:15,144
But I'll turn up at your
funeral in my dancing shoes!

464
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:17,212
- How's that, eh?
- Lexie...

465
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:20,282
- I'm sorry, she really seems...
- like a spoiled wee brat.

466
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:22,885
I know. I suppose I
should blame her mother.

467
00:22:22,886 --> 00:22:25,420
The thing is, Archie,
I've set my heart

468
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:27,689
on her coming
to the wedding and...

469
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,158
see, if she doesn't,
well...

470
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,426
I might just have to call
the whole thing off.

471
00:22:31,427 --> 00:22:34,429
- I'm sorry.
- I'll talk to her. I promise.

472
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,364
Don't do
anything hasty.

473
00:22:45,975 --> 00:22:47,876
<i>( knocks )</i>

474
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,784
Don't tell me.

475
00:22:55,785 --> 00:22:59,121
She's got her heart set on
me coming to the wedding.

476
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:01,056
No talent for music,
my mother,

477
00:23:01,057 --> 00:23:03,826
but she can play any man
like a ukulele.

478
00:23:03,827 --> 00:23:05,727
Lexie, Pamela's
making a real effort.

479
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,930
Why don't you
just give her a break?

480
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:09,664
Okay,
she winds you up.

481
00:23:09,665 --> 00:23:12,134
Father does that to me.
I know how you feel.

482
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:17,005
My dad walked out
when I was five years old.

483
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:20,843
Ever since then, my mother's
brought home everything in trousers.

484
00:23:20,844 --> 00:23:22,744
I didn't have a home.

485
00:23:22,745 --> 00:23:25,380
I grew up in a flophouse
pretending to be 30,

486
00:23:25,381 --> 00:23:27,049
while she pretended
she was 17.

487
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,884
You sure you know
how that feels?

488
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:40,963
Then one day, this creep she'd
brought home made a pass at me.

489
00:23:42,332 --> 00:23:45,033
I told her.

490
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:48,103
She believed him.

491
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:51,706
Some guy she just met.

492
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:54,943
Said it was my-
"wishful thinking. "

493
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,315
I had to leave.

494
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:03,051
15 and living
on the streets,

495
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:06,054
staying in bedsits
and hostels.

496
00:24:09,092 --> 00:24:11,760
Then one day
I fixed upon Glenbogle.

497
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:15,797
Your mother took me in.

498
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:22,737
This is the nearest thing
to home I've ever had.

499
00:24:25,308 --> 00:24:27,876
<i>Do you really know
how that feels, Archie?</i>

500
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:35,250
I'm not going
to the wedding.

501
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,520
I'd rather leave.

502
00:24:53,236 --> 00:24:55,904
What's the punishment
for truancy?

503
00:24:57,173 --> 00:24:59,707
- Expulsion.
- Katrina-

504
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,911
seeing as we're all being
expelled anyway, it hardly matters.

505
00:25:02,912 --> 00:25:06,548
Would it have made any
difference if I'd been here?

506
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:08,550
It would have made
a difference to me.

507
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:11,586
I had to go
to Edinburgh.

508
00:25:11,587 --> 00:25:13,788
Some friends
are setting up

509
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:15,991
a wildlife park
in New Zealand.

510
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:19,294
4,000 square miles
of virgin forest.

511
00:25:19,295 --> 00:25:21,363
And they
need a ranger.

512
00:25:21,364 --> 00:25:23,465
Who did you suggest?

513
00:25:23,466 --> 00:25:26,601
The best man
for the job.

514
00:25:26,602 --> 00:25:27,936
Me.

515
00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:31,606
I know.

516
00:25:31,607 --> 00:25:34,176
New Zealand isn't exactly
handy for commuting.

517
00:25:37,313 --> 00:25:39,881
Well...
what about Glenbogle?

518
00:25:39,882 --> 00:25:42,117
My work here is finished.
Duncan can manage.

519
00:25:43,652 --> 00:25:45,787
Right.

520
00:25:45,788 --> 00:25:48,023
Well, at least
one of us has a job.

521
00:25:49,825 --> 00:25:51,994
I've, um...

522
00:25:51,995 --> 00:25:55,163
never been good at sticking
in one place, Katrina.

523
00:25:55,164 --> 00:25:57,899
Never had much reason to
till I met you.

524
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,370
<i>I haven't accepted
the job yet,</i>

525
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:04,539
<i>and I'm not going to,
unless you come too.</i>

526
00:26:06,476 --> 00:26:08,343
Me?

527
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:14,849
<i>( knocks )</i>

528
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:20,455
Arch, good to see you.
Thanks, haz.

529
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:22,824
So what are you doing
in this neck of the woods?

530
00:26:22,825 --> 00:26:25,293
I was wondering if you
had time for a pint?

531
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:29,064
- I'm not sure...
- if you're busy then...

532
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:32,000
don't be daft. I'm a civil
servant. I'll finish off here.

533
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:34,102
What, closing down
another primary school?

534
00:26:34,103 --> 00:26:36,438
Sorry, Archie,
you know how it is,

535
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:38,606
the relentless quest
for efficiency.

536
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:41,209
We are right on the edge
of the catchment area.

537
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,011
You must have
some discretion.

538
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:45,813
I'd love to, Arch, but Lizzie
wants rationalization,

539
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:47,649
and that's what
she's gonna get.

540
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:51,086
- Lizzie?
- Sorry. Elizabeth Renshaw,

541
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:52,521
<i>Minister
for Education.</i>

542
00:26:52,522 --> 00:26:54,722
<i>My boss.</i>

543
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:57,825
Okay, so...
what about sponsorship?

544
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,627
<i>You postpone closing
the school while we</i>

545
00:26:59,628 --> 00:27:02,431
try to find local businesses
who want to help with funding.

546
00:27:02,432 --> 00:27:04,232
Interesting.
Show me some figures,

547
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:06,168
we'll review the situation
next year.

548
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:08,236
Once the school is closed,
that is it!

549
00:27:08,237 --> 00:27:10,172
100ut of 10
for effort, Arch,

550
00:27:10,173 --> 00:27:12,807
but I'm sorry,
the decision's been made.

551
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:15,077
Well, I had to ask.

552
00:27:18,381 --> 00:27:20,715
Isn't that you
with...

553
00:27:20,716 --> 00:27:22,750
the first minister?
Yes.

554
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:26,054
At a private dinner for
high flyers, so-called.

555
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:27,655
And there you are
getting a medal...

556
00:27:27,656 --> 00:27:30,392
for excellence
in media relations.

557
00:27:30,393 --> 00:27:32,194
Silly, really,
but...

558
00:27:36,332 --> 00:27:39,568
"Andrew McArdle,
M.A. Hons, Oxford. "

559
00:27:40,703 --> 00:27:42,804
So they changed
their minds then?

560
00:27:42,805 --> 00:27:45,140
<i>- Who?
- Oxford.</i>

561
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:48,676
I distinctly remember you
failed the entrance exam.

562
00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:51,179
Yes, but I- I retook it.

563
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,348
Mmm... no, you didn't.

564
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:55,584
You never went
to university.

565
00:27:55,585 --> 00:27:57,152
There's nothing wrong

566
00:27:57,153 --> 00:27:59,621
with a little poetic license
on the old C.V.

567
00:27:59,622 --> 00:28:02,023
I suppose not, unless you use it to land

568
00:28:02,024 --> 00:28:03,891
a cushy job with
the civil service.

569
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:07,195
<i>Oh, dear...</i>

570
00:28:07,196 --> 00:28:08,997
<i>Jackanory.</i>

571
00:28:14,237 --> 00:28:16,271
<i>Archie:
What are those?</i>

572
00:28:16,272 --> 00:28:18,906
New flyers
for the campaign.

573
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:22,177
Wish I'd caught you sooner. I
could have saved you the trouble.

574
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:25,280
- Oh? - The good news is
the school will be staying open,

575
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:27,815
the bad news
is the older kids

576
00:28:27,816 --> 00:28:29,984
will still have to go
to Glenmorriston,

577
00:28:29,985 --> 00:28:32,086
so the school will
only need one teacher.

578
00:28:33,556 --> 00:28:35,923
You've been pulling
strings, haven't you?

579
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:37,425
Something
like that.

580
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:39,060
That's fantastic.

581
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:41,729
I wish there was something
I could do to repay you.

582
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,231
You could take
over Glenbogle

583
00:28:43,232 --> 00:28:45,200
while I go on holiday
for a year or two.

584
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:47,235
Are you gonna tell me
what's wrong now?

585
00:28:47,236 --> 00:28:49,137
Oh, not much.
Golly's got the hump,

586
00:28:49,138 --> 00:28:51,973
father's insulted the minister,
Lexie's matricidal,

587
00:28:51,974 --> 00:28:54,543
everyone seems determined
to knacker this project

588
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:57,479
- before it's even started.
- The grand wedding project.

589
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,548
No one seems to care
that I am trying

590
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:02,150
to turn Glenbogle
into a successful venue.

591
00:29:02,151 --> 00:29:04,286
But it's not a venue,
it's your home.

592
00:29:04,287 --> 00:29:06,721
<i>I know you're trying
to turn a profit,</i>

593
00:29:06,722 --> 00:29:10,592
but what's the point if it's
making everyone miserable?

594
00:29:10,593 --> 00:29:13,228
You know, you are really
irritating when you're right.

595
00:29:15,898 --> 00:29:18,032
So... when are you
gonna tell Maureen

596
00:29:18,033 --> 00:29:19,967
<i>that her job's
going?</i>

597
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:23,104
I don't know. I have to wait
for the right time.

598
00:29:23,105 --> 00:29:24,406
Well, good luck.

599
00:29:24,407 --> 00:29:28,343
In my experience,
there isn't one.

600
00:29:36,185 --> 00:29:38,052
<i>( car approaches )</i>

601
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:45,026
Oh. Hi.

602
00:29:45,027 --> 00:29:46,194
( grunts )

603
00:30:04,747 --> 00:30:06,481
Can you tell me
why you think

604
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:09,217
the Reverend Mitchell
is such a pompous windbag

605
00:30:09,218 --> 00:30:11,586
when you never even
go to church?

606
00:30:11,587 --> 00:30:12,954
I heard him once.

607
00:30:12,955 --> 00:30:14,956
Didn't think much
of it.

608
00:30:14,957 --> 00:30:16,591
At Jamie's funeral.

609
00:30:16,592 --> 00:30:19,026
Was it?
I don't remember.

610
00:30:20,162 --> 00:30:21,730
That's what
mother told me.

611
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,303
I remember him talking
about god's special purpose,

612
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:30,505
how we mustn't
question it.

613
00:30:30,506 --> 00:30:33,275
How pain told you
that you were alive,

614
00:30:33,276 --> 00:30:35,176
and that Jamie
was in a better place.

615
00:30:35,177 --> 00:30:37,679
My son was lying there
in a coffin and that...

616
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,448
arrogant halfwit was telling me
it was all for the best.

617
00:30:41,584 --> 00:30:44,185
I'm sorry, I had no idea.

618
00:30:44,186 --> 00:30:47,221
Why should you? You were
only a boy at the time.

619
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,825
I do remember that day.

620
00:30:50,826 --> 00:30:53,662
<i>Silence everywhere...</i>

621
00:30:55,464 --> 00:30:58,533
mother trying to smile
but her eyes were so red...

622
00:31:01,504 --> 00:31:04,172
Jamie should have been
running this place.

623
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:06,107
He could have organised
a wedding

624
00:31:06,108 --> 00:31:08,876
without putting
everyone's backs up.

625
00:31:08,877 --> 00:31:12,180
You don't do
too badly...

626
00:31:12,181 --> 00:31:14,382
all things considered.

627
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:19,253
You can't go. There's a job for you here

628
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:21,623
now that Archie's
saved the school.

629
00:31:21,624 --> 00:31:23,257
There's a job
for somebody.

630
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:27,028
I wouldn't have to fire my
deputy if it weren't for Fergal.

631
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:29,931
Katrina, you're part of this
place, not just the school.

632
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:31,766
The village,
the big house.

633
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:34,469
And Archie's a good
manager. He's stubborn,

634
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,771
headstrong.

635
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:39,541
You're the only one that
can get through to him.

636
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:42,644
<i>- he needs you.
- You wouldn't know it.</i>

637
00:31:42,645 --> 00:31:45,146
<i>He doesn't
know it, lass.</i>

638
00:31:45,147 --> 00:31:49,283
You ask him what he thinks
before you decide.

639
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:51,353
I want to, but-

640
00:31:51,354 --> 00:31:53,388
<i>what?
Are you scared?</i>

641
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:55,056
I am not scared.

642
00:31:55,057 --> 00:31:57,091
Good.

643
00:31:57,092 --> 00:31:59,694
So Archie's stubborn
and headstrong?

644
00:31:59,695 --> 00:32:01,929
He's like a big kid
sometimes.

645
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,931
Would he go off
and sulk

646
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:06,200
<i>if he couldn't play
the bagpipes?</i>

647
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:10,004
That is about standing up
for our culture, Katrina.

648
00:32:10,005 --> 00:32:12,940
I thought it was about
some stranger's wedding.

649
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:15,477
<i>Archie's trying
to run a business.</i>

650
00:32:15,478 --> 00:32:17,545
He can't do it
on his own.

651
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:21,883
Pamela: This orchestra idea is daft.

652
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:23,651
I think what we need
is a big band.

653
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:26,788
Saxophones, white djs, the
whole jang-bang shooting match.

654
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:28,757
- I talked to Lexie.
- Don't fret.

655
00:32:28,758 --> 00:32:31,793
She'll cheer up when she sees
that designer frock I got her.

656
00:32:31,794 --> 00:32:33,728
She's not gonna be
your bridesmaid.

657
00:32:33,729 --> 00:32:35,430
I thought she
worked for you.

658
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:37,465
I don't hire her out
for weddings.

659
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:41,302
I see. She's been spinning you

660
00:32:41,303 --> 00:32:43,505
one of her sad sob stories, has she?

661
00:32:43,506 --> 00:32:46,841
Poor wee neglected Lexie. What about me?

662
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:49,143
Do you think it was fun
being a single mother?

663
00:32:49,144 --> 00:32:51,078
Whatever problems
you and Lexie have,

664
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:54,416
you can work them out, but
making her your bridesmaid

665
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:56,584
perhaps isn't the right place to start.

666
00:32:56,585 --> 00:32:58,386
We can still do
your wedding,

667
00:32:58,387 --> 00:33:01,656
- though not on the scale you'd imagined.
- What do you mean?

668
00:33:01,657 --> 00:33:04,358
Glenbogle isn't
really the place for...

669
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,160
big bands
and hot air balloons.

670
00:33:06,161 --> 00:33:08,663
Are you saying you
won't arrange them?

671
00:33:08,664 --> 00:33:10,732
I'm saying
we can do something

672
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:12,634
really special
and intimate-

673
00:33:12,635 --> 00:33:14,101
oh...

674
00:33:14,102 --> 00:33:17,138
I don't want "special...
and intimate. "

675
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:19,641
I want it
the way I planned it.

676
00:33:19,642 --> 00:33:21,976
I want the tent,
I want the lilies,

677
00:33:21,977 --> 00:33:24,846
and I want that backstabbing
wee madam out here

678
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:26,581
<i>wearing the dress
that I paid for!</i>

679
00:33:26,582 --> 00:33:29,383
But no- she's far
too busy slagging me off!

680
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:30,718
And you believe her!

681
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:34,188
This was supposed
to be my special day!

682
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:37,258
And you two
have ruined it!

683
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:39,561
I'm phoning
my lawyer!

684
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:44,699
I never wanted
to get married in this...

685
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,968
ugly slum anyway!

686
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:55,009
Oh... super.

687
00:34:35,384 --> 00:34:38,152
Oh, you- you've...
had the place painted.

688
00:34:38,153 --> 00:34:40,622
That was 10 years ago.

689
00:34:40,623 --> 00:34:41,956
Oh.

690
00:34:50,098 --> 00:34:51,766
Yes, Stewart
liked it gloomy.

691
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:53,234
It suited him.

692
00:34:53,235 --> 00:34:54,869
- Stewart?
- Reverend James.

693
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,303
Chap you
took over from.

694
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:59,206
Man of few words. Shortest
sermons in Scotland.

695
00:35:00,743 --> 00:35:03,477
Not big on the
"religious twaddle," then?

696
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:07,381
- No. Well...
- when I started out,

697
00:35:07,382 --> 00:35:10,451
I knew a minister's duty
was to offer comfort,

698
00:35:10,452 --> 00:35:13,988
so I used to talk.
A lot. The trouble is,

699
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:16,390
I knew nothing except
cliches from books.

700
00:35:16,391 --> 00:35:18,192
I was that green.

701
00:35:19,528 --> 00:35:22,229
When I think of what I
said at your son's funeral,

702
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,331
I want to hang my head
in shame.

703
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,369
I'm sorry.
I didn't realise-

704
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,738
no-
I'm sorry, Hector.

705
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:33,240
I've been wanting
to apologise for years.

706
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:36,044
I was just too embarrassed,
I suppose.

707
00:35:37,446 --> 00:35:39,246
<i>I came to apologise
to you.</i>

708
00:35:46,088 --> 00:35:48,255
Take a seat.

709
00:35:48,256 --> 00:35:51,192
It's a good place
to be still.

710
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:53,995
And I promise
to say nothing.

711
00:36:10,846 --> 00:36:12,647
You never made up
with Lexie?

712
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:14,716
She's the one
making things up.

713
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:16,818
I came here
to get married, Pamela.

714
00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:19,587
- Why do you think I came?
- To show off.

715
00:36:19,588 --> 00:36:21,889
To rub Lexie's nose
in your good fortune.

716
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,258
You haven't stopped needling
her since we arrived.

717
00:36:24,259 --> 00:36:25,893
Aye, well,
it's her fault.

718
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:27,795
She brings out
the worst in me.

719
00:36:27,796 --> 00:36:30,231
Why, because she reminds
you of your mistakes?

720
00:36:30,232 --> 00:36:32,667
I just don't want
to get married here, okay?

721
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:34,769
So you canceled it,
just like that?

722
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:38,239
<i>- without even telling me? - You can get
married here by yourself if you want.</i>

723
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,574
I don't want
to get married at all.

724
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:43,477
You used to make me
laugh, you know?

725
00:36:43,478 --> 00:36:46,047
<i>You used to make me feel
I was the luckiest man alive.</i>

726
00:36:46,048 --> 00:36:47,515
<i>And now...</i>

727
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:50,818
I think if you came
into my cafe, I'd turn you away.

728
00:36:51,954 --> 00:36:54,122
I wish I'd never seen
that money.

729
00:37:02,064 --> 00:37:05,266
If you're sticking your
head in there, move over.

730
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:07,368
No point.
There isn't gas.

731
00:37:11,306 --> 00:37:13,675
I told Pamela
you won't be appearing.

732
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:17,745
What did she say?

733
00:37:17,746 --> 00:37:20,915
<i>She didn't say much.
She screamed a lot.</i>

734
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:23,785
About lawsuits and
bankruptcy, that sort of thing.

735
00:37:23,786 --> 00:37:25,586
- She wouldn't.
- Forget it.

736
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:27,989
I'm not dragging you
to the altar in chains.

737
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,391
I'd never find the shoes
to match, for one thing.

738
00:37:31,526 --> 00:37:32,760
I'm sorry, Arch.

739
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:34,929
Oh, don't apologise.

740
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,431
We don't choose
our parents.

741
00:37:37,432 --> 00:37:40,367
The worst thing is
what she does to you.

742
00:37:40,368 --> 00:37:42,904
You're normally so
vivacious and exuberant.

743
00:37:42,905 --> 00:37:44,305
Sharp.

744
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:48,076
As soon as Pamela walks in,
you shrivel up.

745
00:37:48,077 --> 00:37:49,243
I know. It's just she-

746
00:37:49,244 --> 00:37:51,412
<i>but it's only
because you let her.</i>

747
00:37:51,413 --> 00:37:53,848
Don't you see how much
she envies you?

748
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:55,917
- Me?
- Yes, you.

749
00:37:55,918 --> 00:37:57,985
<i>She envies
your independence,</i>

750
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,721
<i>your self-reliance,</i>

751
00:37:59,722 --> 00:38:02,590
your self-assurance.
And your looks.

752
00:38:03,726 --> 00:38:05,093
Stop, Arch.

753
00:38:05,094 --> 00:38:06,460
Okay.

754
00:38:06,461 --> 00:38:08,096
No, go on.

755
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:11,032
I mean it, Lexie, you are
everything that she wants to be.

756
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:12,900
<i>I know you had
a terrible childhood,</i>

757
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:14,769
<i>and I can't begin
to imagine it, but...</i>

758
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:18,272
<i>you're you, in spite of
all your disadvantages.</i>

759
00:38:18,273 --> 00:38:20,975
And that just makes you
more amazing.

760
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:25,679
Thanks, Arch.
You're a very sweet man.

761
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,515
In spite of all
your- advantages.

762
00:38:29,651 --> 00:38:30,651
Come on.

763
00:38:32,888 --> 00:38:36,758
Now, no more talk about
leaving Glenbogle, okay?

764
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:38,926
You are wanted here.

765
00:38:38,927 --> 00:38:41,095
What for? You're a
better cook than I am.

766
00:38:41,096 --> 00:38:43,497
For your Lexie-ness.

767
00:38:43,498 --> 00:38:46,467
- Wanted by whom?
- By everyone.

768
00:38:46,468 --> 00:38:47,701
Including you?

769
00:38:49,071 --> 00:38:51,605
Especially me.

770
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:03,851
Katrina, hi.
We were just-

771
00:39:03,852 --> 00:39:07,388
yeah, I can see.
I shouldn't have-

772
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:09,690
wh-who are you
looking for?

773
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:11,625
It doesn't matter.

774
00:39:13,528 --> 00:39:15,462
Timing, eh?

775
00:39:16,965 --> 00:39:18,966
Where are you going?

776
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:21,135
I'm just gonna
help my mom pack.

777
00:39:21,136 --> 00:39:22,369
Do you want a hand?

778
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,838
No.

779
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,074
I'm just gonna chuck
her clothes out the window.

780
00:39:33,782 --> 00:39:37,451
It's only me. You can
turn off the waterworks.

781
00:39:37,452 --> 00:39:39,887
Leave me alone.

782
00:39:39,888 --> 00:39:42,623
What's up?

783
00:39:42,624 --> 00:39:45,293
He's gone.
Run off.

784
00:39:45,294 --> 00:39:47,494
<i>Just like
the rest of them.</i>

785
00:39:47,495 --> 00:39:49,964
Eric?

786
00:39:49,965 --> 00:39:52,499
Well...
like you say,

787
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,302
<i>men are like
buses-</i>

788
00:39:54,303 --> 00:39:57,371
<i>nothing for ages, then
three arrive at once.</i>

789
00:39:57,372 --> 00:39:59,006
Aye, well...

790
00:39:59,007 --> 00:40:01,843
the bus service around here
ain't what it used to be.

791
00:40:01,844 --> 00:40:03,811
So, what?

792
00:40:03,812 --> 00:40:05,913
You have money
for taxis.

793
00:40:05,914 --> 00:40:07,882
It's not about
the money.

794
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:09,483
That's not why
I was marrying him.

795
00:40:09,484 --> 00:40:11,252
Yeah, right!

796
00:40:11,253 --> 00:40:14,889
Think the worst.
Go ahead.

797
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,958
But he was always...

798
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,425
so good to me.

799
00:40:18,426 --> 00:40:21,562
Never judged me, and...

800
00:40:21,563 --> 00:40:24,531
he was always... there.

801
00:40:24,532 --> 00:40:26,600
Until you drove him off.

802
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,404
It's never your fault,
is it?

803
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:33,140
Everyone always dumps
on poor wee Pamela.

804
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,942
Aye, including
my family.

805
00:40:34,943 --> 00:40:36,277
Oh, come on!

806
00:40:36,278 --> 00:40:38,312
You didn't expect me
to run into your arms.

807
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:40,281
You must have known
what would happen.

808
00:40:40,282 --> 00:40:41,749
It happens to you
all the time!

809
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,018
And what would you know?
Look at you,

810
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:47,755
with your pert wee face and your
lovely skin and your perfect body,

811
00:40:47,756 --> 00:40:51,292
living in a beautiful house
surrounded by people who love you!

812
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:53,560
What do you know
about anything?

813
00:40:58,133 --> 00:41:00,401
Well...

814
00:41:00,402 --> 00:41:02,103
jealousy...

815
00:41:02,104 --> 00:41:03,637
( together )
... gets you nowhere.

816
00:41:08,576 --> 00:41:11,379
Look, you didn't
love him.

817
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,948
So just... dry your eyes
and move on.

818
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:15,917
I did love him.

819
00:41:15,918 --> 00:41:17,751
I do.

820
00:41:20,722 --> 00:41:22,790
You really do,
don't you?

821
00:41:22,791 --> 00:41:24,558
<i>( bagpipes playing )</i>

822
00:41:43,312 --> 00:41:45,479
Do you need
some help there?

823
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,148
Are you taking
the haimish?

824
00:41:47,149 --> 00:41:48,882
These are bagpipes,
okay?

825
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:51,319
If you don't like them,
you can cover your ears.

826
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,855
- Henderson's, 1930s?
- What?

827
00:41:54,856 --> 00:41:56,924
I used to skirl a bit
myself, in the army.

828
00:41:56,925 --> 00:42:00,194
- Thought you hated them.
- That was Pamela, not me.

829
00:42:00,195 --> 00:42:02,029
You let a woman
forbid you the pipes?

830
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:04,898
Hand them over. There's
life in the old fingers yet.

831
00:42:08,837 --> 00:42:12,673
( playing )

832
00:42:14,776 --> 00:42:18,712
Wouldn't it be more humane
just to kill it outright?

833
00:42:18,713 --> 00:42:20,581
What are you
doing here?

834
00:42:21,783 --> 00:42:23,384
I brought you
something.

835
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:31,792
Treacle tart.

836
00:42:31,793 --> 00:42:34,161
That'll glue together
a broken heart.

837
00:42:34,162 --> 00:42:36,263
Right, well...

838
00:42:36,264 --> 00:42:37,798
we'll leave you
to it.

839
00:43:09,264 --> 00:43:12,833
Molly: Jimmy said we'd have a
crate of pink champagne by midday.

840
00:43:12,834 --> 00:43:14,768
I'll believe that
when I see it.

841
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:18,739
Put that by the loch, then move
the trellis from the flower garden.

842
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,774
<i>- What's going on?
- didn't anyone tell you</i>

843
00:43:20,775 --> 00:43:22,443
there's gonna be
a wedding?

844
00:43:22,444 --> 00:43:24,711
I think you're
giving away the bride,

845
00:43:24,712 --> 00:43:26,747
but not in that jumper.

846
00:43:26,748 --> 00:43:28,416
Who's gonna officiate?

847
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:30,918
Hector: Reverend Mitchell
said he can come over anytime.

848
00:43:30,919 --> 00:43:33,220
I suggested 10:30 so we can
have a quick run-through.

849
00:43:33,221 --> 00:43:34,755
Morning, Archie.

850
00:43:34,756 --> 00:43:36,690
Did I miss something?

851
00:43:36,691 --> 00:43:39,193
I know you were planning
a grand ceremony, dear,

852
00:43:39,194 --> 00:43:42,763
but Pamela asked for something
a little more intimate.

853
00:43:42,764 --> 00:43:44,298
Intimate...?

854
00:43:46,268 --> 00:43:48,369
Marvelous.
Absolutely marvelous.

855
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:51,272
No, Hector.
Dreadful.

856
00:43:51,273 --> 00:43:52,906
No sense of style,
that woman.

857
00:43:52,907 --> 00:43:55,776
Oh, what about ivy
for fidelity?

858
00:43:55,777 --> 00:43:57,744
Yes, please.

859
00:43:59,314 --> 00:44:01,382
Which tie would
sir prefer?

860
00:44:01,383 --> 00:44:02,916
They're all lovely.

861
00:44:02,917 --> 00:44:05,652
It's customary just to
wear one, I'm afraid.

862
00:44:05,653 --> 00:44:07,288
Archie,
the minister's here.

863
00:44:13,595 --> 00:44:14,861
How do I look?

864
00:44:15,997 --> 00:44:17,864
Like a gorilla
in a kilt.

865
00:44:17,865 --> 00:44:19,467
Thank you.

866
00:44:21,136 --> 00:44:22,869
A sexy gorilla.

867
00:44:31,379 --> 00:44:32,779
Ahem-hem!

868
00:44:33,948 --> 00:44:36,016
( playing )

869
00:45:14,722 --> 00:45:17,525
...I therefore
declare you to be

870
00:45:17,526 --> 00:45:19,393
husband and wife.

871
00:45:19,394 --> 00:45:21,895
<i>You may kiss
the bride.</i>

872
00:45:23,231 --> 00:45:24,998
- Hector: Bravo!
- ( applause )

873
00:45:31,873 --> 00:45:33,674
Lexie...

874
00:45:33,675 --> 00:45:35,543
I forgot to say...

875
00:45:35,544 --> 00:45:37,278
you look lovely.

876
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:39,780
And I forgot to say,
so do you.

877
00:45:45,253 --> 00:45:46,953
Just a little
something.

878
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:50,524
Oh, Eric, please,
this is far too much.

879
00:45:50,525 --> 00:45:52,726
Listen, son, what
you've given us today,

880
00:45:52,727 --> 00:45:54,795
money can't buy.
Thank you.

881
00:45:55,997 --> 00:45:58,299
Thank you.

882
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,301
Archie...

883
00:46:00,302 --> 00:46:02,035
hi.

884
00:46:02,036 --> 00:46:03,337
That was beautiful.

885
00:46:03,338 --> 00:46:05,939
Yeah, it was...

886
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,374
it was very moving.

887
00:46:13,047 --> 00:46:14,448
What?

888
00:46:14,449 --> 00:46:17,884
I'm giving you
my notice.

889
00:46:17,885 --> 00:46:21,589
I've been offered another job
- in New Zealand.

890
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:24,991
New Zealand? You haven't been
that miserable here, have you?

891
00:46:24,992 --> 00:46:27,261
Quite the opposite.

892
00:46:27,262 --> 00:46:30,631
I've done all I can here.
It's time to move on.

893
00:46:31,766 --> 00:46:33,601
Right, yeah.
Well.

894
00:46:33,602 --> 00:46:35,902
You've done a fabulous job.
Thank you.

895
00:46:35,903 --> 00:46:38,272
I'm going with him.

896
00:46:38,273 --> 00:46:39,306
Eh?

897
00:46:39,307 --> 00:46:41,742
Maureen's
going to take over

898
00:46:41,743 --> 00:46:43,844
as head teacher
at the school.

899
00:46:43,845 --> 00:46:45,946
<i>All this closure
business has...</i>

900
00:46:45,947 --> 00:46:48,282
<i>just made me
rethink my options.</i>

901
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:50,584
I want to see a bit
more of the world

902
00:46:50,585 --> 00:46:53,186
before I...
hand in my bus pass.

903
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:59,460
Right.

904
00:46:59,461 --> 00:47:01,027
<i>Yes, yes, of course.</i>

905
00:47:03,097 --> 00:47:05,399
Well, you'll be missed.

906
00:47:07,835 --> 00:47:09,970
I'll see you
before you go, yeah?

907
00:47:24,152 --> 00:47:26,119
Can you give me
a minute?

908
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,488
Yeah, sure.

909
00:47:31,459 --> 00:47:33,594
Look after Archie
for me, okay?

910
00:47:33,595 --> 00:47:35,996
I hope you two will
be very happy together.

911
00:47:37,131 --> 00:47:39,733
There is no "us two. "

912
00:47:39,734 --> 00:47:41,435
Not the way you mean.

913
00:47:43,037 --> 00:47:46,573
What you saw the
other day, it was just-

914
00:47:46,574 --> 00:47:48,375
we were both
a bit lost-

915
00:47:48,376 --> 00:47:50,544
<i>needed a bit of reassurance, that's all.</i>

916
00:47:52,714 --> 00:47:55,716
Though I wouldn't mind it
if we did.

917
00:47:55,717 --> 00:47:58,151
Someday.

918
00:47:58,152 --> 00:48:00,887
But maybe
after you've gone.

919
00:48:00,888 --> 00:48:03,857
I'm not catching him
on the rebound.

920
00:48:05,126 --> 00:48:07,027
<i>Good luck
to you too, okay?</i>

921
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:14,167
See you.

922
00:48:25,112 --> 00:48:27,514
