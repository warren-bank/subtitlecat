1
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,769
Man 1:
Stop the clock. well?

2
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,804
Man 2:
Two minutes, 25 seconds.

3
00:00:28,805 --> 00:00:30,538
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

4
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,607
- Damn.
- Sorry.

5
00:00:34,144 --> 00:00:36,945
We've done it in 2.23 and
that was in father's old rover.

6
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:39,281
I thought these places
were all hotels now.

7
00:00:39,282 --> 00:00:41,683
Some have managed to hang on.
Death duties did for me.

8
00:00:41,684 --> 00:00:44,186
We were neighbors separated
by a few thousand acres,

9
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:45,954
but this used to be
my second home.

10
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:48,690
- Hi, I'm Lexie.
- Hi, we're expected.

11
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:51,960
Still, Fulham to Glenbogle
in eight hours- not bad.

12
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:54,196
I'll let the laird
know you're here then.

13
00:00:54,197 --> 00:00:56,064
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

14
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,035
( man laughing )

15
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:38,139
Ah, yes.

16
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:45,914
Here.
This is the spot.

17
00:01:45,915 --> 00:01:49,484
( whistles )

18
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:52,587
<i>( whistle echoes )</i>

19
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:56,390
<i>( echoing )</i>

20
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:07,435
Woody Woodpecker.

21
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:11,205
Yeah, the-
the bags are in the back.

22
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:12,306
No joyriding.

23
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:17,478
- David?
- Hello!

24
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,781
Your secret whistle.

25
00:02:19,782 --> 00:02:22,283
- Mine and Jamie's.
- And Archie's.

26
00:02:22,284 --> 00:02:24,853
Yes, of course...
and Archie's.

27
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:28,356
Oh, let me look at you.
You haven't changed at all.

28
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,359
- You're still as lovely as ever.
- Always the charmer.

29
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,762
Good to be back, Molly. This
is my good friend Jonathan.

30
00:02:33,763 --> 00:02:36,430
- How do you do?
- Welcome to Glenbogle.

31
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:38,833
- We were expecting you
to bring- - Sarah, I know.

32
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:42,303
Rush job, couldn't make it. I thought
you wouldn't mind if I brought Jonathan.

33
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,505
Not at all. Does Archie
know that you're here?

34
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:46,808
Lexie, is that her name,
I think she's-

35
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:49,343
so, you've met
Archie's adorable wife.

36
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:51,412
Oh, my god.
Lexie, of course.

37
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:53,581
I thought
she worked here.

38
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:55,516
She does.
We all do.

39
00:02:55,517 --> 00:02:58,687
If you'll excuse me,
I'm expecting Kilwillie.

40
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,322
- You remember Lord Kilwillie, don't you?
- Yes.

41
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:03,291
I think we passed him
on the drive.

42
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,314
Once you're
quite decent,

43
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:28,616
we can go for that
walk you suggested.

44
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:35,356
I bet you no one's ever mistaken
Molly for the housekeeper.

45
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:37,325
You're being
over-sensitive.

46
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,197
- Lexie, please.
- Not until you give me a kiss.

47
00:03:42,198 --> 00:03:44,933
- They're waiting.
- So am I.

48
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,969
Do you not want
to kiss me?

49
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:57,145
Now away and play
with your friends.

50
00:03:57,146 --> 00:03:59,214
- Archie!
- David!

51
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:01,216
Archie,
you old dog.

52
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:03,651
I should have been here.
What about the stag do?

53
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:05,720
He promised me
I'd be best man.

54
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:07,756
I promised him
a night to remember.

55
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:10,424
It was all a bit of a rush.
Anyway, you're here now.

56
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:12,393
So, this is who
you wanted me to meet.

57
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:14,328
I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

58
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:16,731
- Sarah couldn't make it?
- Called away on business.

59
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:19,134
You know how it is. Everything's
so bloody last minute.

60
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:22,003
The bush fires
- they're all putting out bush fires.

61
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:24,139
Look, I'm so sorry
about earlier.

62
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,207
You must think me
impossibly rude.

63
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,209
Please put it down
to car lag.

64
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,145
Archie, you've
certainly moved on.

65
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:32,280
It's very good to meet you,
Lexie MacDonald.

66
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:33,915
( giggles )

67
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,985
Now look, I brought an old friend
along with me, Jonathan Pell.

68
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:39,287
He's an old school
friend of mine.

69
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:41,555
I think Molly approves,
but he's a bit of a wimp.

70
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:44,525
He faints at the sight of mud,
but he's sound. Sound as they come.

71
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:46,828
Now, Archie,
a drink I think

72
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,830
and then football.
Come on.

73
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:55,303
It's- it's not the easiest
thing for a chap to admit,

74
00:04:55,304 --> 00:04:57,538
but it is pressing.

75
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,640
It's very pressing.

76
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:02,777
Has been for some
time actually.

77
00:05:02,778 --> 00:05:04,913
Quite some time.

78
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,750
Isn't this glorious?

79
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,120
Yes, yes,
glorious.

80
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:14,755
You see, what I'm
trying to say is-

81
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,992
you do know I'm very
fond of you, Molly.

82
00:05:17,993 --> 00:05:19,660
Of course you are,
Kilwillie.

83
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:21,930
You were
so fond of Hector.

84
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:27,101
I'm not sure fond is the word
I was looking for exactly.

85
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:28,970
Let's go and see
the wolves, shall we?

86
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:32,340
Ah, Golly!
How nice.

87
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:34,275
Oh, yes.

88
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:36,077
How nice.

89
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:41,816
David:
Ready, Jonathan?

90
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,889
Come on, Jonathan!

91
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,590
<i>- Yeah!
- no!</i>

92
00:05:49,591 --> 00:05:53,094
- The MacDonalds cream the Frasers.
- That won't last.

93
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:55,363
<i>Oh god, Archie,
it's good to be back.</i>

94
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:58,599
- Just like the old days.
- Well, not quite.

95
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,301
No.

96
00:06:00,302 --> 00:06:02,603
You and Jamie always
used to make me keep goal.

97
00:06:02,604 --> 00:06:04,438
It's mine!
It's mine!

98
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,442
- Mine, mine!
- He's there. he takes it!

99
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:11,012
Oh, for god's sake.
It's only a game.

100
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:12,780
Game?

101
00:06:15,117 --> 00:06:17,251
<i>Molly: Glenbogle's first native wolves.</i>

102
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,420
Archie must be pleased.

103
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,957
They came out of the
nursery cave this morning.

104
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:25,059
<i>Molly: Why isn't that one
playing with the others?</i>

105
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,462
They won't accept it.
That's the runt.

106
00:06:27,463 --> 00:06:29,430
What will
happen to it?

107
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,000
- They'll kill it.
- Kilwillie: That's nature.

108
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:35,971
- Red in tooth and claw.
- Oh, that's awful.

109
00:06:35,972 --> 00:06:38,840
Yes, that's frightful. Can't
you do something about it, Golly?

110
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:40,675
We must not
interfere with nature.

111
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:42,677
Poor little thing.

112
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:45,179
<i>Oh, oh.</i>

113
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,015
<i>( wolf whines )</i>

114
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:49,518
( clucking )

115
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,487
- Are you all right, Kilwillie?
- What?

116
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:54,890
- I think you're sickening for something.
- Really?

117
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:58,259
Golly will drive us back. I'm
feeling rather tired myself.

118
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,630
And the sooner we get you home the
better. Judging by the look of you.

119
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,665
- But Molly!
- I insist.

120
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:11,606
<i>Archie:
Absolutely not!</i>

121
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:14,009
We can't have wild animals
running around the house.

122
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,945
You're prepared to condemn the
poor little creature to death?

123
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:19,681
Mother, it is not a little
creature. It is a small wolf.

124
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:21,816
Yes, dear,
I'm sure you're right.

125
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,426
That looks nice.

126
00:07:31,427 --> 00:07:34,596
Canard a la Glenbogle.
It's French.

127
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:37,465
Ah, are you reading
this, Irene?

128
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:40,134
Oh, yeah, I'm about
halfway through.

129
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:43,538
- So you're interested in archaeology, then?
- Yes.

130
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:47,075
- Yeah, me too.
- Really?

131
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:49,343
There's a lot of history
buried in this estate.

132
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,346
So, Golly, what'd you
think of Archie's friend?

133
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,950
<i>Do you believe that
he told me not to joyride?</i>

134
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:58,419
Quite right.
Listen, there's the remains

135
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,589
of an old dig that you
might like to see.

136
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,523
Not too far from here.
There.

137
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,694
<i>- Oh, a burial site.
- yep.</i>

138
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:07,562
So, tomorrow?

139
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:09,163
Mmm, okay.

140
00:08:09,164 --> 00:08:11,766
<i>- I'll read up on it tonight.
- good.</i>

141
00:08:16,472 --> 00:08:18,539
Can I come-

142
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,408
to the burial thingie?

143
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:21,977
Don't tempt me,
Duncan.

144
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,348
<i>- Come on, Archie!
- ( banging on table )</i>

145
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:30,284
<i>You might not have had a stag
party before the wedding, Archie,</i>

146
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:32,887
<i>but you're certainly
going to have one now!</i>

147
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,589
- Stop the clock!
- Yes!

148
00:08:35,658 --> 00:08:37,759
Not bad.

149
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,628
Archie and Lexie,

150
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:41,562
may they live
happily ever after.

151
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,665
Hadn't we better
wait for Lexie?

152
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,835
- It's a woman's prerogative to be late, Jonathan.
- Or not turn up.

153
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:52,507
- So you were at college with-
- Archie and Lexie!

154
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:54,475
Absent friends.

155
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,090
<i>( wolf whining )</i>

156
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:17,532
<i>( whines )</i>

157
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,434
Whew.

158
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:30,712
Am I doing this right?

159
00:09:30,713 --> 00:09:34,582
Perfect, Duncan,
just perfect.

160
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:39,087
So, are you going
exploring with Golly then?

161
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:40,955
Yeah, I think so.

162
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,857
- Jealous?
- No.

163
00:09:44,226 --> 00:09:45,694
Oh.
( chuckles )

164
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:48,029
Is there anything
I can get you?

165
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,799
Yes, there is
actually.

166
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,801
We wouldn't happen
to have any liver

167
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:55,704
<i>- going spare, would we?
- Liver?</i>

168
00:09:55,705 --> 00:09:57,538
I have this
sudden craving.

169
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:00,141
Don't actually like the stuff.
Completely irrational.

170
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:03,477
Well, I'll see
what I can find.

171
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,780
Raw, it must be raw.

172
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:11,519
And some milk
if you can spare it.

173
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,221
Please.

174
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:14,723
Mmm.

175
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,793
Funny tummy, Molly.

176
00:10:18,794 --> 00:10:21,262
My Auntie Liz swears
by milk and liver.

177
00:10:21,263 --> 00:10:23,264
( chuckles )

178
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,971
You look wonderful.

179
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:32,674
Thank you.

180
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:35,075
I just saw Molly heading
towards the tower.

181
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:39,046
- I think she was talking to Hector.
- Father?

182
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:41,416
That's what
it sounded like.

183
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:45,586
Hmm.

184
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:48,589
- The Lady of Glenbogle.
- All: The Lady of Glenbogle.

185
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,591
Thank you.

186
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:55,296
Now I think
this happy occasion

187
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:56,864
calls for
the Grand MacDonald.

188
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,666
I'll have a word
with Golly.

189
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,234
I thought you
were the laird.

190
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:03,304
All right, we'll set off
first thing in the morning.

191
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:05,473
- Good man.
- What is the Grand MacDonald?

192
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,208
Land a salmon,
bag a grouse,

193
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,143
stalk and shoot a stag,
all in a day.

194
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:11,512
- Then, there is the Royal MacDonald.
- Ah!

195
00:11:11,513 --> 00:11:15,015
<i>- Jonathan: what's that?
- All the above, plus you get to bed the laird's wife.</i>

196
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:17,418
In your dreams.

197
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:19,854
Father was the last person
to win the Grand MacDonald.

198
00:11:19,855 --> 00:11:22,657
Hector was furious.
He had to hand over the prize.

199
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:24,625
<i>A case of the laird's
finest malt.</i>

200
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:26,994
I'll put up
a bottle of port.

201
00:11:26,995 --> 00:11:29,831
- Times hard, Archie?
- No.

202
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:31,699
And we've ordered
a stripper.

203
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,800
What? when?

204
00:11:32,801 --> 00:11:34,935
Tomorrow night.
I did promise you

205
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:38,172
a stag party, Archie,
I do hope you don't mind.

206
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:40,408
Isn't that what boys do?

207
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,077
<i>( door opens )</i>

208
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,212
Ahh.

209
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:50,585
Canard a la Glenbogle.

210
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,720
( chuckles )

211
00:11:52,721 --> 00:11:55,723
- So who was your best man?
- Duncan.

212
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:57,992
Rush job then?

213
00:11:57,993 --> 00:11:59,761
<i>( laughing )</i>

214
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,064
<i>I did the tatties
and them.</i>

215
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:05,633
Mange-tout.

216
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:08,202
- Mange-tout.
- It looks great.

217
00:12:09,872 --> 00:12:11,672
Molly not joining us?

218
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:13,474
No, no.
It's been a long day.

219
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:14,809
Oh, dear.

220
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,878
Molly came
into the kitchen

221
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,813
asking for raw liver
and milk.

222
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:21,749
<i>- do you still play cricket after dinner?
- We haven't for years.</i>

223
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,485
Excellent. That's settled
then. You, Jonathan and...

224
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:27,121
uh... my stand-in,

225
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:30,024
versus me, Lexie, and...

226
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:31,626
yes, we're one short.

227
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:34,028
<i>- ( doorbell rings )
- Lexie: I'll get it.</i>

228
00:12:41,036 --> 00:12:43,404
<i>You do scrub up well.</i>

229
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:45,306
The new Lady
of Glenbogle.

230
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,442
- It suits you, my dear.
- Thank you.

231
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:49,844
We weren't expecting to see
you again this evening.

232
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:51,979
Well, no-

233
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,983
Molly did ask me to
drop in if I was passing

234
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:59,554
and there is a small matter
I need to discuss with her.

235
00:12:59,555 --> 00:13:01,823
<i>- ( laughing )
- I'm not intruding, am I?</i>

236
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,724
Archie's got
some friends over.

237
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:06,928
The Fraser boy-
he was always a willful child.

238
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:10,297
- Where is Molly?
- Last seen going to the tower.

239
00:13:10,298 --> 00:13:12,433
Tower it is.

240
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:18,172
- Cricket?!
- Oh, I like a man who plays cricket.

241
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,407
There's something solid
and manly about it.

242
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:22,309
The swing of the bat.

243
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,712
Those red stains
on the bowler's crisp whites.

244
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:28,349
Yeah, I love cricket.

245
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,018
Yeah, the smack
of leather

246
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,687
on- on-
on whatever...

247
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:36,524
and my P.E. Teacher
said I had ability.

248
00:13:37,726 --> 00:13:39,560
( clucks tongue )

249
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:43,998
Natural all-rounder-
play football, too.

250
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,833
I hate football.

251
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,935
Yeah, I don't
like it either.

252
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:49,837
I just play it...

253
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:51,706
sometimes...
not often..

254
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,574
Hardly ever
in fact.

255
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,782
<i>Molly:
Stop it.</i>

256
00:14:01,783 --> 00:14:03,518
<i>No!</i>

257
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:08,088
( panting )

258
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:11,058
<i>Oh, Hector, no!</i>

259
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,093
<i>Now I shall have
to clean that up.</i>

260
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:15,262
<i>- Hector, stop it!
- ( knocks )</i>

261
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:17,131
Molly!

262
00:14:17,132 --> 00:14:20,868
<i>- who is it?
- It's me, Kilwillie.</i>

263
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:23,270
<i>- just a minute.
- ( door unlocks )</i>

264
00:14:28,544 --> 00:14:31,145
- What do you want?
- Well, I was just passing

265
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:34,749
and I wondered-
are you all right?

266
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,817
Yes, perfectly,
thank you.

267
00:14:36,818 --> 00:14:38,953
<i>( lock clanks )</i>

268
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,557
May I come in?

269
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:49,063
<i>( door unlocking )</i>

270
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,204
What on earth
are you doing up here?

271
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:59,840
Oh, I've decided
to convert the tower

272
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:03,077
into a conservatory-
observatory.

273
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:05,713
- I'm taking up astrology.
- Astronomy?!

274
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:07,782
Yes, quite.

275
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:10,184
Oh, I think that's
a marvelous idea!

276
00:15:10,185 --> 00:15:13,120
There's a wonderful view
of the stars... over there.

277
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,890
- Ooh.
- At night.

278
00:15:17,726 --> 00:15:19,860
What sort of telescope
will you use?

279
00:15:19,861 --> 00:15:21,662
Do you think
I'll need one?

280
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:23,497
I should say.

281
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:28,335
Kilwillie, what would
I do without you?

282
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:30,571
Oh.

283
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:32,707
( humming )

284
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,642
Where did you learn

285
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,644
all this archaeology
stuff, Golly?

286
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,278
Folk tales,
books.

287
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,716
- Books?
- Yeah, books. The library's full of them.

288
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:47,221
Well, it's up
to you, Golly,

289
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:48,823
but I don't think
Irene'll enjoy

290
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:51,358
all this archaeology
clambering-over-rocks stuff.

291
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:55,562
And since when are you the expert
on what Irene likes or doesn't like?

292
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:58,132
I may know more
than you think, Golly.

293
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:00,200
<i>Take cricket for example.</i>

294
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:02,236
She likes cricket
does she?

295
00:16:02,237 --> 00:16:04,271
She thinks it's
a game for wussies.

296
00:16:04,272 --> 00:16:05,940
Oh.

297
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:07,942
<i>Now football, Golly,</i>

298
00:16:07,943 --> 00:16:09,677
<i>that's
a different matter.</i>

299
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:13,547
She loves a man
who plays football.

300
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:15,415
She's mad for it.

301
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:18,819
Football?

302
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,989
Right.

303
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:25,893
I've gone solo,
so to speak.

304
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:28,362
It's the best decision
I have ever made.

305
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,731
Plenty of city contacts,
old mates like Jonathan,

306
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:32,533
the money's going
to come rolling in

307
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,668
and nothing begets money
like money itself.

308
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:37,304
<i>You know we're not too
dissimilar, you and I.</i>

309
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:39,473
Entrepreneurs, I know
it's an appalling word,

310
00:16:39,474 --> 00:16:41,642
but one thing about
our lot, we sink or swim.

311
00:16:41,643 --> 00:16:43,777
Evolve or die.

312
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:46,147
Are you swimming
or sinking, Archie?

313
00:16:46,148 --> 00:16:49,383
Treading water mostly.

314
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,852
- Settled the death duties yet?
- No.

315
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:55,022
<i>- Hector's last laugh.
- Yeah, one of many.</i>

316
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:57,691
I've got
a proposition for you.

317
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:02,696
Lexie, who needs a stripper
when we've got you.

318
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,868
It's a joke, Lexie.

319
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:13,274
Forgive me.
Could you?

320
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:20,914
Thank you, Archie.

321
00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:27,654
- You're not joining me?
- Eh, no thanks.

322
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:29,856
Archie always did know
when he'd had enough.

323
00:17:29,857 --> 00:17:32,326
- Just like Sarah.
- I'd like to meet her.

324
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:34,395
You will.

325
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,832
And have you
phoned her?

326
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,335
- Phoned her?
- Yeah.

327
00:17:41,336 --> 00:17:43,036
To let her know
you arrived safely.

328
00:17:43,037 --> 00:17:44,838
I called her
on the mobile.

329
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,907
<i>And is she missing you?</i>

330
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,578
Desperately.

331
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:52,413
Hmm, I bet.

332
00:17:56,585 --> 00:18:00,187
1994 was particularly
exciting for astronomers.

333
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:02,956
We saw the most dramatic
solar systems

334
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,791
<i>encountered
in living memory.</i>

335
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,894
The hubble telescope
had just been repaired.

336
00:18:07,895 --> 00:18:11,365
It was sending back
remarkable images.

337
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:14,101
Oh, that was
a splendid year, Molly.

338
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,138
You know, Molly,

339
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,540
I've got
something to say.

340
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:25,779
It's rather delicate,
very pressing

341
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,414
and not at all easy.

342
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:29,983
Kilwillie, I really
must ask you to leave.

343
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,885
- But-
- it's getting late.

344
00:18:31,886 --> 00:18:34,855
Oh, well,
yes, of course.

345
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:38,925
- Good night.
- Good night.

346
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:47,301
What do you know
about nickel?

347
00:18:47,302 --> 00:18:49,002
Not a lot.

348
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,672
No, nor did I-
until a few weeks ago.

349
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:55,108
But it seems
that for some time now

350
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:57,244
the price of nickel
has been rising

351
00:18:57,245 --> 00:18:59,613
as supplies
have dropped off.

352
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:01,948
Now, I have it
on the very best authority

353
00:19:01,949 --> 00:19:04,017
that all that's
about to change.

354
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,687
The nickel market is due
a temporary collapse

355
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,190
in three weeks when several
tons of the stuff

356
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,392
will be flooded
onto the world markets.

357
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:13,260
Now when that happens,

358
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:15,563
the price will fall
by 30% or more.

359
00:19:15,564 --> 00:19:17,665
So that's when we buy.

360
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,866
<i>- We?
- just hear me out.</i>

361
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,969
We buy, we hold our nerve
for six months

362
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,805
when the price
will rise again.

363
00:19:24,806 --> 00:19:28,141
Now, the minimum investment my
contacts are looking for is �20,000.

364
00:19:28,142 --> 00:19:30,911
I can raise 10,
but no more.

365
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:33,013
<i>- You need another 10?
- mm-hmm.</i>

366
00:19:33,014 --> 00:19:35,216
You're catching on.
Interested?

367
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:39,119
- Archie...
- it's a lot of money.

368
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,121
It's a lot of money
we haven't got.

369
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:43,056
Let's forget it.
If you really haven't-

370
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:46,560
- no, we haven't.
- No, I could raise it-

371
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,895
<i>- if the deal was right.
- good man.</i>

372
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,164
And what sort of return
could I expect?

373
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:53,033
Enough to pay off
some of your debts,

374
00:19:53,034 --> 00:19:55,369
give you a five-star
honeymoon in the Bahamas

375
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,404
you'll triple your money.

376
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:01,174
- �30,000?
- I'm doing you a favor, Archie.

377
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:06,247
- I'll think about it.
- Break the habit of a lifetime. Take a chance.

378
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,782
<i>- Archie.
- entirely up to you, of course.</i>

379
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:11,084
I said I'll think about it.
That's all.

380
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,153
You do that, Archie.

381
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,525
Old times...

382
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:20,994
<i>and better times
to come.</i>

383
00:20:24,198 --> 00:20:25,866
Lex?

384
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:28,001
I'm going to look
for Jonathan.

385
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:31,004
Excuse me.

386
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:53,027
I'm afraid I got lost.

387
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:55,129
That's easily done.

388
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:59,566
It's like a sort of...

389
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:01,268
time capsule.

390
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,772
This is Jamie's room.
What are you doing here?

391
00:21:06,841 --> 00:21:08,875
I was just showing
Jonathan around.

392
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:10,844
That's my pen knife.

393
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:14,982
He stole it.
Jamie, you old-

394
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,883
he won it.

395
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:19,786
You bet him he couldn't
make my father say "bum. "

396
00:21:19,787 --> 00:21:21,922
So I did.

397
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:25,225
God, this is a bloody museum,
Archie. Jamie hated museums.

398
00:21:27,795 --> 00:21:30,230
He's gone, Archie.

399
00:21:30,231 --> 00:21:33,400
You should have a clear out.
Time to put this lot behind you.

400
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:35,135
Hmm.

401
00:21:35,136 --> 00:21:38,172
I just haven't
gotten around to it yet.

402
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,677
( laughing )

403
00:21:44,946 --> 00:21:47,581
- You on?
- ( laughs )

404
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:52,019
- Come on, go!
- ( cheering )

405
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,954
- Lexie!
- Come on back!

406
00:21:53,955 --> 00:21:56,857
<i>- What are you doing?
- Kilwillie: well done, Lexie!</i>

407
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,959
<i>- Running.
- Duncan: come on, Arch.</i>

408
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,827
Another round,
Jonathan.

409
00:22:00,828 --> 00:22:03,364
Is that a football shirt
Golly's wearing?

410
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:06,666
Yeah, he's mad
about football-

411
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:08,802
hates cricket
- thinks it's a game for wussies.

412
00:22:08,803 --> 00:22:11,205
Huh.

413
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:13,374
<i>Duncan: Come on, Jonathan, singles.</i>

414
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,709
One run.

415
00:22:18,813 --> 00:22:20,680
Yes, right.

416
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:23,050
Lexie, come on!

417
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,486
That's out!

418
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:28,022
- Howzat!
- He's out, he's in!

419
00:22:28,023 --> 00:22:30,157
- I was in!
- Sorry, Archie.

420
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:31,791
- Yes!
- Yes!

421
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:34,828
- Yes!
- Thank you, Golly.

422
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:37,731
<i>( Lexie laughing )</i>

423
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,400
One run, Duncan,
that's all we need.

424
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:42,369
Count on me, Archie.

425
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:46,173
<i>- ( clapping )
- ( gloating )</i>

426
00:22:46,174 --> 00:22:47,707
I was in by a mile.

427
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,876
- It doesn't matter.
- Of course it matters.

428
00:22:49,877 --> 00:22:52,079
( laughing )

429
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,014
<i>Golly: Duncan...</i>

430
00:22:55,683 --> 00:22:57,884
you think Irene's
noticed the shirt?

431
00:22:57,885 --> 00:23:00,354
Oh, yeah.
Definitely.

432
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:03,457
<i>Lexie:
Come on, David.</i>

433
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:06,193
<i>David: Come on, crafty
single that's all we need.</i>

434
00:23:06,194 --> 00:23:08,662
<i>You can do it!</i>

435
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:16,903
Oh, don't mind me.

436
00:23:16,904 --> 00:23:20,074
Oh, cricket,
lovely.

437
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,850
Kilwillie?

438
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:32,652
I'm trying to field
old boy.

439
00:23:32,653 --> 00:23:36,256
- It's about mother.
- Is there anything I can do?

440
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:39,326
<i>- David: come on!
- We're a bit worried about her, actually.</i>

441
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:41,128
Lexie's heard her
talking to herself.

442
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:43,263
We think she might be
talking to father.

443
00:23:43,264 --> 00:23:45,232
We're supposed
to be playing cricket.

444
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:47,901
- She's been asking for raw liver.
- Oh, dear.

445
00:23:47,902 --> 00:23:50,937
<i>- and milk.
- Milk? poor Molly.</i>

446
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:54,074
I think she needs a hobby-
something to occupy herself.

447
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:57,677
Do you know,
I may know just the thing.

448
00:23:57,678 --> 00:23:59,713
You leave it to me,
old boy.

449
00:23:59,714 --> 00:24:02,416
<i>- Lord Kilwillie!
- Yes, yes, we're ready. On we go.</i>

450
00:24:06,954 --> 00:24:09,323
Come on, Duncan,
one run.

451
00:24:21,469 --> 00:24:24,371
<i>- oh!
- oh!</i>

452
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:29,243
Howzat!

453
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:31,011
- A six! a six!
- That's a catch!

454
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,746
( screaming )

455
00:24:32,747 --> 00:24:34,214
<i>- A catch!
- house rules!</i>

456
00:24:34,215 --> 00:24:37,784
<i>- catch!
- catch!</i>

457
00:24:37,785 --> 00:24:39,353
- Yes!
- Yes!

458
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:41,655
I don't believe it!

459
00:24:41,656 --> 00:24:43,890
- Yeah!
- That's terribly wrong.

460
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,932
House rules?
We don't know house rules.

461
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:55,068
Well, those aren't
my house rules.

462
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:56,770
Sorry, mate,
what can I say?

463
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:58,639
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.

464
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,843
Well, you can't
win them all, David.

465
00:25:03,844 --> 00:25:06,480
<i>( laughs )</i>

466
00:25:07,682 --> 00:25:09,550
( whines )

467
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:50,691
You're not really going
to give him any money?

468
00:25:50,692 --> 00:25:52,259
It's an investment.

469
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,794
Why don't you
just tell him the truth?

470
00:25:54,795 --> 00:25:58,198
<i>- Tell him what?
- That we haven't got the money.</i>

471
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,100
I might be able
to raise it.

472
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,801
If you can raise
that sort of money

473
00:26:01,802 --> 00:26:03,770
we could do with
spending it around here.

474
00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:07,374
We could have
a honeymoon, Lex.

475
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:09,343
<i>You heard
what he said.</i>

476
00:26:26,728 --> 00:26:30,264
Don't you not think it's a bit weird
that he hasn't even phoned Sarah?

477
00:26:30,265 --> 00:26:33,333
If you went away for a weekend
you would phone me, wouldn't you?

478
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:35,068
How do you know
he hasn't phoned her?

479
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:37,036
When did you last get

480
00:26:37,037 --> 00:26:39,205
a signal on a mobile
up here?

481
00:26:44,512 --> 00:26:47,046
No, Hector,
not in there.

482
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:50,049
<i>Archie: I'm sure he's very sorry</i>

483
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,152
that he thought
you were the housekeeper.

484
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:55,855
Being your wife is no guarantee that
your friends are going to like me.

485
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:58,492
Nor that you're
going to like them.

486
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:02,562
I never said
I didn't like him.

487
00:27:02,563 --> 00:27:04,230
It's pretty obvious.

488
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:07,200
<i>I have known him
a very long time.</i>

489
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:09,169
<i>I know.</i>

490
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,638
<i>Then maybe you could
make more of an effort.</i>

491
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,744
I'm sorry if you think
I don't like him.

492
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:21,548
I'm going to go to sleep now.
Good night.

493
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,672
( sniffs )

494
00:27:45,673 --> 00:27:47,607
Lex?

495
00:27:47,608 --> 00:27:49,676
What?

496
00:27:49,677 --> 00:27:51,778
Can you smell bacon?

497
00:28:03,624 --> 00:28:06,793
- Hard paddle.
- Oh.

498
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:20,940
Hey, Archie,
you're it.

499
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:26,279
- Come on, Archie!
- Go, Archie.

500
00:28:27,315 --> 00:28:29,649
Jamie, jaime!

501
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,585
<i>David, David!</i>

502
00:28:33,988 --> 00:28:37,157
<i>- get it, Archie.
- oh, come on, Archie!</i>

503
00:28:38,726 --> 00:28:40,594
<i>Lexie:
Morning, Molly.</i>

504
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:43,830
Have you and Archie
had a falling out?

505
00:28:46,534 --> 00:28:48,235
I can't help it.

506
00:28:48,236 --> 00:28:50,537
I've tried
for Archie's sake,

507
00:28:50,538 --> 00:28:54,107
but I just
don't like David.

508
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:56,476
He is
an acquired taste.

509
00:28:56,477 --> 00:29:00,013
Like cod liver oil?

510
00:29:00,014 --> 00:29:01,714
Hey, I win!

511
00:29:01,715 --> 00:29:03,916
- You got me on a bad day.
- Yeah, right!

512
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:06,586
David has to be
the best at everything.

513
00:29:06,587 --> 00:29:08,888
It's a family trait.

514
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:10,590
<i>Archie:
Hurry up, David!</i>

515
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:13,560
I imagine he's feeling
rather rootless at the moment.

516
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:15,395
Oh, he'll say
it's freedom

517
00:29:15,396 --> 00:29:17,230
or some
such nonsense.

518
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:18,865
But it comes to the same in the end.

519
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:20,400
Yes!

520
00:29:20,401 --> 00:29:23,102
<i>Archie on the other hand
has found his place.</i>

521
00:29:23,103 --> 00:29:25,772
And you and Archie
have found each other.

522
00:29:27,675 --> 00:29:30,710
Hmm... I just don't like
the way he treats Archie.

523
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,648
Don't be too hard
on him.

524
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:36,650
He needs us...

525
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:39,619
and I suppose
in a way we need him.

526
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,921
<i>Why would we
need David?</i>

527
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:46,793
To keep
the memories alive.

528
00:29:48,696 --> 00:29:51,097
Don't let him feel
too pushed out.

529
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:55,935
( laughing )

530
00:30:03,077 --> 00:30:04,811
What do you think?

531
00:30:04,812 --> 00:30:06,446
Smart enough for Irene?

532
00:30:06,447 --> 00:30:08,548
Is she dressing up, then?

533
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:11,017
Thought we might go
for a wee drink later.

534
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:21,060
- She likes flowers.
- Does she?

535
00:30:21,061 --> 00:30:23,096
<i>Bouquets.</i>

536
00:30:23,097 --> 00:30:24,897
<i>You know,
flowers out of a shop</i>

537
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:27,166
with a wee written note on

538
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:29,736
and that flower food stuff.

539
00:30:31,171 --> 00:30:34,341
Bigger the better. She's
not one for the single rose.

540
00:30:35,843 --> 00:30:38,545
A man has
to show he cares.

541
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:40,747
That's what she said.

542
00:30:40,748 --> 00:30:43,015
Right.

543
00:30:43,016 --> 00:30:44,484
Thanks, Duncan.

544
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,320
No worries, Golly.

545
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:07,674
Archie's not here.

546
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:09,376
<i>I know.</i>

547
00:31:14,315 --> 00:31:16,549
Can we start again?

548
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,652
Archie and I
go back a long way.

549
00:31:18,653 --> 00:31:20,453
I'd hate to fall out
with him.

550
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:23,890
Yeah...
( clears throat )

551
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:25,958
Me, too.

552
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:28,461
<i>Hmm, we have
something in common.</i>

553
00:31:28,462 --> 00:31:32,399
Listen, do you think
we could be friends, David?

554
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,233
<i>Yeah.</i>

555
00:31:34,234 --> 00:31:36,202
I'm sure we can.

556
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:40,006
<i>I just don't want
you to feel</i>

557
00:31:40,007 --> 00:31:42,842
<i>just 'cause me and Archie
are married now, that-</i>

558
00:31:42,843 --> 00:31:46,413
- that you'll come between us?
- Yeah.

559
00:31:46,414 --> 00:31:48,114
You won't.

560
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:09,302
You'll... be late.

561
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:11,170
They can't start
without me.

562
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:12,672
Me neither.

563
00:32:12,673 --> 00:32:15,508
Are you coming, too?

564
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:18,077
Don't worry. I'm only there
to help with the picnic.

565
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:25,752
Oh.

566
00:32:36,396 --> 00:32:40,333
Lexie: They're having fun, eh? The boys?

567
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:42,836
Golly:
How about yourself?

568
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:45,671
If I think David's
bad for Archie,

569
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,473
I should tell him
shouldn't I?

570
00:32:47,474 --> 00:32:50,810
Well, if anyone's
going to tell him

571
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:53,279
it would be better
coming from his wife.

572
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,215
Is that what marriage
is all about-

573
00:32:55,216 --> 00:32:57,616
telling your husband
he's making a fool of himself?

574
00:32:57,617 --> 00:32:59,585
I wouldn't know
about that.

575
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:10,463
Why have you
never married?

576
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:15,034
I don't know.

577
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:20,974
- It's 'cause you're a free spirit, Golly.
- Hmm. is that what I am?

578
00:33:20,975 --> 00:33:24,677
- ( laughs ) aye.
- A free spirit?

579
00:33:24,678 --> 00:33:27,213
See all this?

580
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:29,415
All this and no one
to share it with.

581
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:32,318
That's not
being free, Lexie,

582
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:34,320
that's just being lonely.

583
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,826
Archie!

584
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:43,062
Look!

585
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,498
Well done.

586
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:47,200
Here we go.

587
00:33:47,201 --> 00:33:49,269
Oh, and listen,
that's between you and me.

588
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,471
As far as anyone else is
concerned, I'm a free spirit.

589
00:33:52,472 --> 00:33:55,241
- Okay?
- Okay.

590
00:33:59,546 --> 00:34:01,981
<i>Golly:
Okay, just one more.</i>

591
00:34:01,982 --> 00:34:03,716
That's it.

592
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:09,222
Archie, everything all right
with you and Lexie?

593
00:34:09,223 --> 00:34:11,724
<i>Yeah, fine.
Why shouldn't it be?</i>

594
00:34:11,725 --> 00:34:13,692
A bit of a chill
in the vicinity.

595
00:34:13,693 --> 00:34:15,895
Have you thought
any more about my proposal?

596
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:18,164
- I will, I promise.
- Good, make sure you do.

597
00:34:18,165 --> 00:34:20,166
Thanks.

598
00:34:29,243 --> 00:34:33,112
- Well done, David.
- A kiss for the winner?

599
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,815
- What?
- It's the custom.

600
00:34:35,816 --> 00:34:38,017
( laughs )
You've not won yet.

601
00:34:38,018 --> 00:34:41,254
- On account then.
- What are you doing?

602
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:44,090
- Archie's not watching.
- Yeah, well, I am.

603
00:34:48,996 --> 00:34:50,896
( chuckles )

604
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:56,336
<i>( flapping, quacking )</i>

605
00:34:59,106 --> 00:35:00,873
Good shot, Archie.

606
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,349
Mine!

607
00:35:11,551 --> 00:35:12,918
Yes!

608
00:35:14,188 --> 00:35:15,888
- Jonathan!
- What?

609
00:35:23,364 --> 00:35:25,264
Did I hit anything?

610
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:29,702
Yes, Jonathan,
I believe you did.

611
00:35:37,378 --> 00:35:40,880
What's... Sarah like?

612
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:45,184
- Who?
- David's fiancee.

613
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:48,354
Oh, I wouldn't know. I've only
known David for a few weeks.

614
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:50,789
We met through a mutual
business acquaintance.

615
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,226
This is sort of
a business trip.

616
00:35:53,227 --> 00:35:56,062
Corporate entertainment
I think he called it.

617
00:35:56,063 --> 00:35:58,564
Oh, a business trip?

618
00:35:58,565 --> 00:36:01,967
Oh, I shouldn't
have said that.

619
00:36:01,968 --> 00:36:03,802
David swore me
to secrecy.

620
00:36:03,803 --> 00:36:06,839
Still,
no harm done, eh?

621
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,741
No.

622
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,852
Did you know that
archaeological investigation

623
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:21,854
is our main source
of knowledge

624
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:23,656
for prehistoric,
ancient,

625
00:36:23,657 --> 00:36:26,359
and very old things.

626
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,096
- ( blender whirrs )
- ( loudly ) I've always been very interested

627
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:32,798
in prehistoric archaeology.

628
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:35,701
Even before man could write
the archaeologist was king-

629
00:36:35,702 --> 00:36:37,603
( softly )
King.

630
00:36:37,604 --> 00:36:39,905
You don't have
to compete, Duncan.

631
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,874
No, really,
even at school

632
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:45,344
my archaeology teacher
said I had natural ability.

633
00:36:45,345 --> 00:36:47,913
I'm not a bone for you
and Golly to fight over.

634
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,450
I like you
the way you are.

635
00:36:52,018 --> 00:36:54,454
- You do?
- Yes.

636
00:36:54,455 --> 00:36:57,256
You mean you're not
interested in me for my mind?

637
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:58,524
No.

638
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:01,461
Me neither.

639
00:37:04,998 --> 00:37:06,932
<i>- ( blender spins )
- Ohh!</i>

640
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:12,905
Sorry.

641
00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:27,553
There.

642
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:37,263
- Mine, I think.
- No.

643
00:37:37,264 --> 00:37:39,198
I saw it first.

644
00:37:40,267 --> 00:37:42,801
Just like
you taught me, Golly.

645
00:37:46,273 --> 00:37:48,207
Just like
you taught me.

646
00:37:52,446 --> 00:37:55,481
- Why'd you do that?
- You didn't deserve it.

647
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,916
- Archie did, I suppose?
- Just give me the gun.

648
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:02,087
Golly.

649
00:38:04,391 --> 00:38:07,793
- Golly, he's my guest.
- If you were any kind of friend to him,

650
00:38:07,794 --> 00:38:10,896
- you would sort him out about a few things.
- What's that mean?

651
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:12,831
Open your eyes, son!

652
00:38:14,768 --> 00:38:16,101
He's right, Archie.

653
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:19,705
This has nothing
to do with you!

654
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:55,174
Why do you think
Jonathan's here?

655
00:38:55,175 --> 00:38:57,176
He's an old college
friend of David's.

656
00:38:57,177 --> 00:39:00,947
No- he isn't.
He hardly even knows him.

657
00:39:00,948 --> 00:39:03,116
<i>He's just a business
acquaintance</i>

658
00:39:03,117 --> 00:39:05,752
and David is using this weekend
to try and impress him.

659
00:39:05,753 --> 00:39:07,820
Another one of his
scams, no doubt.

660
00:39:10,423 --> 00:39:12,825
He lied to you, Archie.

661
00:39:12,826 --> 00:39:14,527
He must have had
his reasons.

662
00:39:14,528 --> 00:39:17,864
Yeah, he saw you coming. Has
done ever since you were boys.

663
00:39:17,865 --> 00:39:20,833
Just because you don't like the
man doesn't mean he's a crook.

664
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:23,002
He made a pass at me!

665
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,341
( sighs )

666
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,032
Hi, it's about
the bouquet.

667
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:54,934
I phoned earlier.

668
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:56,969
The romance special
I think it's called.

669
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,771
Golly?

670
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,740
Ah, Kilwillie.

671
00:40:03,877 --> 00:40:05,845
Thank you.

672
00:40:05,846 --> 00:40:08,447
Isn't that a bit girlie
for a ghillie, Golly?

673
00:40:12,986 --> 00:40:16,222
<i>Molly: It won't be long now, Hector.</i>

674
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:23,029
Ta-da!

675
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:26,532
Oh you fool, Kilwillie!
You've let him escape!

676
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:29,869
- What's that?
- It's a surprise.

677
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,570
I've no time
for surprises.

678
00:40:31,571 --> 00:40:34,273
<i>- It's a telescope for your observatory.
- what observatory?</i>

679
00:40:34,274 --> 00:40:36,943
You said you were going to have
an observatory in the tower.

680
00:40:36,944 --> 00:40:39,879
There's a particularly interesting
alignment of venus tonight.

681
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,215
I thought we could
watch it together.

682
00:40:42,216 --> 00:40:45,151
Sounds fascinating.
Hector? Hector?

683
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:48,320
Molly, Hector is dead.

684
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:51,423
Kilwillie, I know
Hector is dead.

685
00:40:51,424 --> 00:40:54,961
Then why, Molly dear, do you
persist in talking to him?

686
00:40:54,962 --> 00:40:56,629
It's so dreadfully
american.

687
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,899
- I was talking to Hector the wolf cub.
- Wolf cub?

688
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,902
The runt that I rescued
from certain death

689
00:41:02,903 --> 00:41:05,238
at great personal risk
to myself, I might add.

690
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:08,174
And you, Kilwillie,
have let him escape.

691
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:09,976
Oh, Molly!

692
00:41:12,946 --> 00:41:14,981
Oh...
( laughs )

693
00:41:14,982 --> 00:41:16,816
Thank you, Golly.

694
00:41:16,817 --> 00:41:18,450
That was fascinating.

695
00:41:18,451 --> 00:41:20,486
Burial sites are
definitely my thing.

696
00:41:20,487 --> 00:41:23,022
Listen, I know a place
where the wind doesn't blow.

697
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:25,024
And the sky's
so low you feel

698
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:27,326
you can reach up
and touch the stars.

699
00:41:27,327 --> 00:41:29,528
That's a lovely
thought, Golly.

700
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,964
Another time, maybe.

701
00:41:31,965 --> 00:41:35,334
Right. right.

702
00:41:53,353 --> 00:41:55,688
I thought you'd
lost your marbles.

703
00:41:55,689 --> 00:41:57,456
Lost my marbles?

704
00:41:57,457 --> 00:41:59,859
Archie asked me
to keep an eye on you.

705
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,994
- Oh, he did did he?
- Yes.

706
00:42:01,995 --> 00:42:04,130
So that's what
all this is about-

707
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:05,998
keeping the doddering
old dowager happy.

708
00:42:05,999 --> 00:42:07,700
Molly,
these are from me.

709
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:11,003
Tokens of my very deep
and profound admiration.

710
00:42:11,004 --> 00:42:14,406
I am disappointed in you.
Really I am.

711
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:17,476
I'm sorry, Molly.
I am terribly sorry.

712
00:42:17,477 --> 00:42:19,645
If you want to make up
for this treachery,

713
00:42:19,646 --> 00:42:21,413
you will help me
find the cub

714
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:24,250
and you won't breathe
a word of it to anyone.

715
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:26,185
Whatever you say.

716
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,258
I lost my job...

717
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,193
three months ago.

718
00:42:34,194 --> 00:42:38,798
One or two speculative
moves that went wrong.

719
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:41,267
A little bit
too much of this.

720
00:42:44,504 --> 00:42:48,240
So I-
struck out on my own.

721
00:42:48,241 --> 00:42:50,877
So far things haven't
quite worked out.

722
00:42:55,382 --> 00:42:58,651
But- money's gone.
Sarah with it.

723
00:42:58,652 --> 00:43:00,820
I don't suppose
she could stand

724
00:43:00,821 --> 00:43:03,189
the for-richer-
for-poorer bit.

725
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,457
Why didn't you tell me?

726
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:08,127
Jamie's little brother?

727
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:10,863
I don't need
your sympathy, Archie.

728
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:14,901
Just my money, hmm?

729
00:43:19,506 --> 00:43:21,407
There is no
nickel thing, is there?

730
00:43:22,843 --> 00:43:24,610
No.

731
00:43:24,611 --> 00:43:27,279
<i>- What were you going to do with the money?
- it was a loan.</i>

732
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,182
I'd have given it back.

733
00:43:29,183 --> 00:43:30,717
When?

734
00:43:33,787 --> 00:43:36,723
- And who exactly is Jonathan?
- Business acquaintance.

735
00:43:36,724 --> 00:43:38,991
- Not a friend.
- I'm working on that.

736
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:42,228
If you wanted to use me and my
house for corporate entertainment

737
00:43:42,229 --> 00:43:45,231
<i>- all you had to do was ask.
- Well, I'll know to next time.</i>

738
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,902
There won't be
a next time.

739
00:43:49,903 --> 00:43:51,904
( chuckling )

740
00:43:59,546 --> 00:44:02,615
Okay, David, what happened
with Lexie this morning?

741
00:44:02,616 --> 00:44:05,718
<i>- What do you mean?
- you know exactly what I mean.</i>

742
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:08,320
Unless, of course,
you're saying my wife is a liar.

743
00:44:08,321 --> 00:44:10,923
( laughing )
What is this?

744
00:44:10,924 --> 00:44:13,025
Kiss and tell.

745
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:16,295
Come on, Archie.
Just a bit of fun.

746
00:44:16,296 --> 00:44:18,898
How much fun exactly?

747
00:44:18,899 --> 00:44:21,834
Well... a pretty girl.

748
00:44:21,835 --> 00:44:25,704
You should know-
quite a lot actually.

749
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:28,574
I was going
for the Royal MacDonald.

750
00:44:28,575 --> 00:44:30,542
( laughs )

751
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:34,413
I needed to take
something away with me.

752
00:44:34,414 --> 00:44:36,215
( chuckles )

753
00:44:42,455 --> 00:44:44,490
That was a lucky punch.

754
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:50,263
Boys, that's enough.

755
00:44:50,264 --> 00:44:52,231
I said
that's enough!

756
00:44:58,172 --> 00:45:00,840
Sorry, Golly.
I'm all right.

757
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:03,910
Stop it!

758
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:07,513
I think you better go.

759
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,125
I had him, Golly.
I really had him.

760
00:45:19,126 --> 00:45:22,094
Yes, son,
I believe you did.

761
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:23,963
<i>( woman screams )</i>

762
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:28,868
Easy now.
Easy there.

763
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:30,336
That's it.
That's it.

764
00:45:30,337 --> 00:45:33,706
Easy now.
Easy boy.

765
00:45:33,707 --> 00:45:36,209
Easy! take care!
Stay back!

766
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:40,947
Oh, come on, Hector.

767
00:45:40,948 --> 00:45:43,749
Some nice people
from the wild animal sanctuary

768
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,451
are coming to collect you.

769
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:48,354
So you see I haven't
lost my marbles.

770
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:52,058
She's wonderful.

771
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:54,793
<i>I don't know what you were
worrying about, old boy.</i>

772
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,165
Have you been fighting?

773
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:01,100
Hmm, tsk-tsk-tsk.

774
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:18,918
It's just-

775
00:46:18,919 --> 00:46:21,720
seeing you and Molly
and the house-

776
00:46:23,357 --> 00:46:25,824
I wanted it to be
like it always was.

777
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:28,427
Things will never
be the same, David.

778
00:46:29,963 --> 00:46:31,964
I can't say
I didn't try.

779
00:46:31,965 --> 00:46:34,833
No.

780
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,869
Bye.

781
00:46:44,477 --> 00:46:46,445
<i>( car starts )</i>

782
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,322
Are you two boys
friends again?

783
00:46:56,323 --> 00:46:58,791
I don't know.

784
00:46:58,792 --> 00:47:01,527
He reminds me
of Hector.

785
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:03,262
Father?

786
00:47:03,263 --> 00:47:05,264
No, the runt.

787
00:47:05,265 --> 00:47:07,166
I feel sorry
for David.

788
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:10,403
- You're not thinking of taking him in as well, are you?
- No.

789
00:47:12,072 --> 00:47:14,206
It's time
to move on, mother.

790
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:17,910
Jamie's gone,
so is father.

791
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,780
Talking of which,

792
00:47:21,781 --> 00:47:24,650
I think it's time we
cleared out Jamie's room.

793
00:47:24,651 --> 00:47:28,321
Yes, yes I believe
you're right.

794
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:37,330
You've got to impose
your will on the beasties.

795
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:40,632
Show them who's boss.
One wrong move and you're dead.

796
00:47:42,202 --> 00:47:44,236
Duncan,

797
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:47,606
you are a very
brave man.

798
00:47:47,607 --> 00:47:50,309
Well, wolves are
dangerous thing-

799
00:47:53,347 --> 00:47:55,348
natural born killer-

800
00:47:57,484 --> 00:47:59,585
ask Golly.

801
00:48:02,189 --> 00:48:04,156
Maybe not.

802
00:48:10,397 --> 00:48:13,799
- Have they gone?
- Yeah.

803
00:48:17,371 --> 00:48:19,705
Will you miss him?

804
00:48:19,706 --> 00:48:21,640
Probably.

805
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:24,010
Even though he bring out
the worst in me.

806
00:48:24,011 --> 00:48:26,045
I could have
told you that.

807
00:48:26,046 --> 00:48:28,247
( chuckles )
I think you did.

808
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:32,351
- If you love me-
- and I do.

809
00:48:32,352 --> 00:48:34,753
Then you must
tell me everything.

810
00:48:38,392 --> 00:48:40,559
What?

811
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,529
Nothing. just something me
and Golly were talking about.

812
00:48:52,705 --> 00:48:55,007
I love you, too,
Mrs. MacDonald.
