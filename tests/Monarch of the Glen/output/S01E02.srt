1
00:00:11,143 --> 00:00:13,244
( ringing bell )

2
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,368
Ah, thank you, Lexie.

3
00:00:30,437 --> 00:00:32,805
( humming )

4
00:00:34,374 --> 00:00:36,308
- Anything for me?
- I fear not.

5
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:38,444
What about that?
It's from the bank, look.

6
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:40,379
Yes, but it is
addressed to me, see?

7
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,114
Hector M. MacDonald,
Esquire.

8
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:43,783
It must be
estate business.

9
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:47,185
I had hoped
the new world order

10
00:00:47,186 --> 00:00:49,889
Might allow a chap to open
his own correspondence.

11
00:01:10,744 --> 00:01:12,478
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

12
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:48,246
<i>( door opens )</i>

13
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:51,249
<i>Hector:
Tell me, boy...</i>

14
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,852
<i>Do you count
packing suitcases</i>

15
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:55,020
As your very
favorite hobby?

16
00:01:57,557 --> 00:02:00,292
<i>- Are you in pain?
- Archie: It's my back.</i>

17
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:03,195
If I'm gonna stay, I'll have to
do something about that mattress,

18
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:06,565
- It's like a sack of King Edward's.
- Right.

19
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:09,134
Of course, so,
you're staying on?

20
00:02:09,135 --> 00:02:10,769
<i>Archie: No.</i>

21
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,938
Well, yes.
Just for a while,

22
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:15,240
Just to straighten a
few things out. Okay?

23
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:16,509
I think so.

24
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,844
But, if you're staying,
why are you going?

25
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:21,146
To talk things over
with Justine and work out

26
00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:23,916
How we're going to manage
the restaurant in the meantime.

27
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:26,519
I feel sorry for Justine,
but I'm glad for our sakes,

28
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,354
- We're both glad. Aren't we, Hector?
- ( murmurs )

29
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:32,658
I still believe the only long-term
option is to sell the place.

30
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:34,660
<i>- Look here!
- We'll get a much better price</i>

31
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:36,529
If we straighten out
the accounts

32
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,765
And start capitalizing
on some of our primary assets.

33
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:41,199
So what did he say?

34
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,536
That the estate needed
every asset it had,

35
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:45,771
That they couldn't
afford to give land away,

36
00:02:45,772 --> 00:02:48,407
Maybe later, when he's had
a chance to think about it,

37
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:50,743
- Blah, blah, blah.
- No land, no new gymnasium.

38
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:52,645
For the time
being, anyway.

39
00:02:52,646 --> 00:02:55,514
What a shame. It's just
a piece of old pasture.

40
00:02:55,515 --> 00:02:56,982
I'm disappointed
in the Laird.

41
00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:58,918
I wish you wouldn't
call him that.

42
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,953
Sometimes I think you
do it deliberately.

43
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:03,255
I'm off training.
I'll see you after break.

44
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:06,324
<i>Has the Laird put his name
down for the hill race?</i>

45
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:09,094
I don't know
and I don't care.

46
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:12,197
This is one race I'm going
to win without his permission.

47
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:17,636
Duncan!

48
00:03:17,637 --> 00:03:20,205
I thought I was a character
in "The Godfather" there.

49
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:22,140
<i>- Hello, Lexie.
- What are you doing?</i>

50
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:24,276
Your very hilarious
bat impression?

51
00:03:24,277 --> 00:03:26,545
Training for the race,
watch this.

52
00:03:27,814 --> 00:03:29,615
I can do 50 of these.

53
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:31,584
<i>Lexie: Plus your body's compensating</i>

54
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:33,586
For the lack
of muscle elsewhere.

55
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:35,588
I'm not just talking
about your brain.

56
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,557
What's happening?

57
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:41,493
Well, he's stopping...
And he's going.

58
00:03:41,494 --> 00:03:43,395
Eh?

59
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:46,599
He's going to London for a spot
of conjugal with this Justine bint,

60
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,234
Then he's coming back here
to sort things out.

61
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:51,637
Which probably means
giving us all the push.

62
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,873
Well, don't just
stand there,

63
00:03:54,874 --> 00:03:57,275
His gorgeousness will be
wanting a lift.

64
00:03:57,276 --> 00:03:59,177
Oh. Aye...

65
00:04:01,815 --> 00:04:03,215
Duncan?

66
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:06,619
Duncan?

67
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:16,829
( starts engine )

68
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:19,397
Right.

69
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:23,769
Duncan.

70
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,070
<i>Hector:
Hang on.</i>

71
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:29,608
Off to wage war.

72
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:32,044
Give me a lift
to the front, would you?

73
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:37,116
( brakes screeching )

74
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:43,622
Thank you, men.

75
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:50,029
<i>( birds cawing )</i>

76
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,807
Drop it.

77
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:35,741
Drop it!

78
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:39,411
Turn around slowly.

79
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,347
Hande hoch.

80
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:47,452
Sorry, Kilwillie,
but for you the war is over.

81
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:53,225
( laughing )

82
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:24,689
( hens clucking )

83
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:29,094
See you in
a couple of weeks.

84
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:31,663
Afternoon.

85
00:06:31,664 --> 00:06:33,465
Where can I
get a taxi?

86
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:36,735
- Inverness would be your best bet.
- That's rather inconvenient.

87
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:39,838
- Where are you going?
- A place called Glenbogle House.

88
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,439
That's where I live.

89
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,243
I don't actually live there,
I live in, um- never mind.

90
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:45,677
Archie MacDonald.

91
00:06:45,678 --> 00:06:47,712
Any relation of one
Hector MacDonald?

92
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:49,714
Yeah, he's my father.
And you are?

93
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:51,449
Fleming.

94
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,451
I represent
his bank, Lascelles.

95
00:06:53,452 --> 00:06:57,222
Your father's failed
to reply to my letters.

96
00:06:57,223 --> 00:06:58,456
I see.

97
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:07,199
Well, maybe we can
give you a lift.

98
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:12,537
<i>Kilwillie: Why don't we do
Waterloo? I could be Napoleon.</i>

99
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:15,340
Or what about Agincourt?
We've never fought Agincourt.

100
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:18,343
Bows and arrows. Boring.
I want guns, cannon.

101
00:07:18,344 --> 00:07:20,412
<i>- Malplaquet?
- Nah.</i>

102
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,481
<i>- El Alamein?
- No!</i>

103
00:07:24,884 --> 00:07:26,985
Iwo Jima?

104
00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:28,887
An American battle?
Please, Kilwillie.

105
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:31,089
Culloden, you can be
Bonnie Prince Charlie,

106
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,958
I shall be
Butcher Cumberland.

107
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,726
I'm always Bonnie
Prince Charlie.

108
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:37,495
That's because you're rather
corpulent and fond of the sauce.

109
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:39,264
Come, to battle.

110
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:40,933
It is a misty,
damp morning

111
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:43,735
On the desolate
moor of Culloden.

112
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:46,338
Sorry remnants of
the great Jacobite dream

113
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,540
Stand facing
their nemesis,

114
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,310
The English army.

115
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:54,379
Would you care for something
tasty on an oatcake?

116
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,215
It's a new line of ours.

117
00:07:56,216 --> 00:07:58,516
Kilwillie's
Gentlemen's Relish.

118
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:01,586
( barking )

119
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,191
Oh, god!
Oh! Ow!

120
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:08,793
Archie: Don't worry,
they're very friendly.

121
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:10,829
<i>Take no notice
of them.</i>

122
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,697
<i>It's just their way
of saying hello.</i>

123
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:15,067
<i>Monty, Rommel, down!
No, no, stop it.</i>

124
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,938
They're perfectly friendly,
once you get to know them.

125
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:21,773
<i>As I was saying,
there's a lot</i>

126
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:23,876
<i>Of interesting history
about this house, really.</i>

127
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:26,144
My great-great-grandfather
built the place in the 1870s,

128
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:28,213
But there had been a castle
here before that.

129
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:30,082
Queen Victoria
came to stay once.

130
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,783
But, apparently
she caught a cold,

131
00:08:31,784 --> 00:08:33,418
And had to leave
rather quickly.

132
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,354
My family have been
here for 400 years.

133
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:37,555
I'm sure the early chiefs
were utter rogues, but-

134
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:39,624
Mr. MacDonald, you're
obviously confusing me

135
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,559
With somebody who does
give a monkey's.

136
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,495
I'm not a tripper
or a tourist,

137
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:46,331
Or a loud American in
tartan trousers from Omaha.

138
00:08:46,332 --> 00:08:47,766
I am a banker...

139
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:50,936
Who drew a very short straw, and
traveled a ridiculous distance

140
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:53,505
To conduct an even smaller
piece of business,

141
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:57,409
It seems at the cost of a very
expensive pair of Boston loafers.

142
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,444
Now, can you please
call your father

143
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:01,914
So we can get it
over with?

144
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:03,748
Maybe we should
go to the library?

145
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:09,821
Lexie? Lexie,
I know you're there.

146
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:16,061
Who's your friend? What's
he in such a strop for?

147
00:09:16,062 --> 00:09:19,464
I want tea in the library. Two
people, nice china, bits to eat.

148
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:35,547
I presume your visit's related
to our indebtedness at the bank?

149
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:37,349
To a defaulted loan,

150
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,118
And a breeched
overdraft limit, yes.

151
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:42,120
Mr. Fleming, I'd like
to talk to you

152
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:44,089
About my plans
for the future.

153
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,258
You see,
I own the estate now.

154
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:48,226
I have to tell you
that as from Monday,

155
00:09:48,227 --> 00:09:50,095
Your family's accounts
will be suspended.

156
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:52,497
The bank will then proceed
to call in the loan.

157
00:09:52,498 --> 00:09:54,632
You must find the funds
to repay it,

158
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:57,202
I presume by selling
whatever assets you possess.

159
00:09:58,637 --> 00:10:00,038
The estate
is all we have.

160
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,840
So be it.

161
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:04,809
Mr. Fleming, my mother
and father

162
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,979
Can't leave here.

163
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:12,617
I don't seem to be
making myself understood.

164
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:15,253
Let me put it to you
in words of one syllable:

165
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:19,491
I'm here
to close you down.

166
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:22,494
<i>Radio: � it's more or less the
same as the things that you said �</i>

167
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:29,434
<i>� and anyway, for all
the things you've done �</i>

168
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:32,371
<i>� tell me, why does
the river not flow? �</i>

169
00:10:32,372 --> 00:10:36,341
<i>� and anyway, for all
the things you've said �</i>

170
00:10:36,342 --> 00:10:39,111
<i>� tell me why does
the river run red? �</i>

171
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:40,979
<i>� but anyway... �</i>

172
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,515
That is for
the nice gentleman.

173
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:46,284
If you're hungry, get yourself
some bread and dripping.

174
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:51,123
<i>Lexie: Here we are. Tea up.</i>

175
00:10:51,124 --> 00:10:54,692
And you must be our
very important guest.

176
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:57,496
Mr. Fleming, is it? I've got
an uncle called Fleming,

177
00:10:57,497 --> 00:10:59,498
<i>You're not from
Paisley, are you?</i>

178
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:01,299
I live in Ealing.

179
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,801
W- well, West Ealing,
a- almost as far as Hanwell.

180
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:07,139
My, that sounds...
Complicated.

181
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,540
Yes, thank you-

182
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,475
You look like a man
with a big appetite,

183
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:13,011
So, I've brought you a few
things to get your teeth into,

184
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:15,680
<i>Some pancakes,
drop scones and that.</i>

185
00:11:15,681 --> 00:11:17,382
All freshly
baked, I hope?

186
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:19,684
They were when they
left the factory.

187
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:22,154
<i>No, all home baked.</i>

188
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:23,821
Anyway, well,
Mr. Fleming-

189
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:27,192
Oh, heck, this is no good,
what's your first name?

190
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:30,128
- Me? - I'm not
crossed-eyed, pet.

191
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:32,630
I am looking into
your deep blue eyes.

192
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:36,468
I- I couldn't
possibly say.

193
00:11:36,469 --> 00:11:38,336
Man of mystery.

194
00:11:38,337 --> 00:11:40,905
I'll wheedle it out of you
one way or the other.

195
00:11:40,906 --> 00:11:44,176
<i>Anyway, I'm away
to get one of those</i>

196
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:46,711
13 spare rooms ready for you.
One of the better ones.

197
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:48,913
One that's been slept in
in the last century-

198
00:11:48,914 --> 00:11:50,315
But, I couldn't
possibly stay-

199
00:11:50,316 --> 00:11:53,351
Oh, what happened
to your slip-on?

200
00:11:56,822 --> 00:11:58,957
Oh, your poor wee tassle.

201
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,259
Let me look at it
for you.

202
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:03,595
<i>Come on.</i>

203
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:05,029
Trust me.

204
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:14,406
( softly )
there.

205
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:18,343
Oh dear, oh dear.

206
00:12:18,344 --> 00:12:20,812
I'll tell you
what I'll do,

207
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:23,681
I'll get the estate's resident
cobbler to fix it for you.

208
00:12:23,682 --> 00:12:25,383
Okay?

209
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:31,490
Now you'll have
to stay, won't you?

210
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:36,628
Who was that?

211
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:38,296
Oh, that was Lexie.

212
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:40,665
She kind of
runs the place.

213
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,234
Tea?

214
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,171
Ah.

215
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:48,607
Thanks for the game, Kilwillie,
I really enjoyed it.

216
00:12:48,608 --> 00:12:50,675
Not very surprising,
you won.

217
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:53,578
Of course I did. Where would
we be if Bonnie Prince Charlie

218
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,780
Suddenly started winning
the battle of Culloden?

219
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:58,049
Living in a country that
had been independent

220
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,118
For two and a half
centuries, probably.

221
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:01,886
What an appalling
thought.

222
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,067
<i>Molly:
But who is he, Archie?</i>

223
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:17,735
Someone very powerful, mother,

224
00:13:17,736 --> 00:13:20,138
Someone who could turn
us all out of here.

225
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:23,908
- What's he doing, Lexie?
- Some personal grooming.

226
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,977
<i>Archie: Right. Here's
what we have to do.</i>

227
00:13:25,978 --> 00:13:28,446
We have to persuade him,
seduce him-

228
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,614
Oh, aye?

229
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:32,484
And who's gonna
do that, then?

230
00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:34,586
<i>Is there something
wrong with your jaw?</i>

231
00:13:34,587 --> 00:13:37,322
Make him see that this
is a place with potential,

232
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:40,458
That we can put it back on its feet,
that his bank's money is safe with us.

233
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:42,527
What do you want
us to do, then?

234
00:13:42,528 --> 00:13:45,930
Do?
Yes, do. Um...

235
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,601
Well...

236
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:54,172
I'll make a presentation.
Yes, he'll like that,

237
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:57,509
<i>A presentation about how
we're gonna develop the place.</i>

238
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,712
Golly, you and Duncan show him
the estate, give him some sport.

239
00:14:00,713 --> 00:14:03,181
Make sure he catches
something really big, okay?

240
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,550
But I've got my final
training for the hill race.

241
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:08,453
Mother, maybe you could
give him a tour of the house?

242
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:11,155
Or I wonder if he's
interested in gardening?

243
00:14:11,156 --> 00:14:13,225
I'm desperately
in need of some help.

244
00:14:13,226 --> 00:14:14,892
And you, Lexie,

245
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:17,529
Just be nice
to him, okay?

246
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,197
Yes, oh master.

247
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:21,333
He shall be as putty
in my windows.

248
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:23,935
Yeah, and it'll be curtains
for him if he doesn't mind out.

249
00:14:23,936 --> 00:14:25,903
There, nancy-boy's shoe's
all done.

250
00:14:25,904 --> 00:14:29,407
The most important thing, all of you,
is we must keep him away from my father.

251
00:14:29,408 --> 00:14:31,943
From now on, we must make sure
that he's never on his own,

252
00:14:31,944 --> 00:14:35,313
<i>That he can't be got at by the old
man because that could be disastrous.</i>

253
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:36,681
Ah, Archie.

254
00:14:39,485 --> 00:14:42,153
- ( boat horn honking )
- oh, no!

255
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:47,726
Hey, you?

256
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:50,194
<i>Yes, you!</i>

257
00:14:50,195 --> 00:14:52,330
- Take the painter.
- The what?

258
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:54,432
The rope,
you dolt!

259
00:14:55,768 --> 00:14:57,435
<i>Oh, hold on,
come on, man.</i>

260
00:14:57,436 --> 00:14:59,271
<i>Over there, what's the matter with you?</i>

261
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:05,577
You can let go now.

262
00:15:07,813 --> 00:15:10,382
- Thanks, Kilwillie, off you go.
- Bye, old man.

263
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:13,418
Next time, I'll grind you
into the dust, at Bull Run!

264
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:20,525
One of those water
board bods, are ya?

265
00:15:20,526 --> 00:15:21,526
Pardon?

266
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:22,827
What is it this time?

267
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:25,263
Measuring acid rain
or some such nonsense?

268
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:26,464
You must be
Hector MacDonald.

269
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:27,965
Sir to you.

270
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:30,468
You chaps have such
a comfy billet.

271
00:15:30,469 --> 00:15:33,338
And the likes
of me pay for it.

272
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,807
As far as I can see, Mr.
MacDonald, you pay for very little.

273
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:37,575
What did you say?

274
00:15:37,576 --> 00:15:40,178
I'll take my foot to your
tradesmen's entrance in a minute.

275
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:42,714
Father!

276
00:15:42,715 --> 00:15:45,417
I don't work for the water
board, I represent your bank.

277
00:15:45,418 --> 00:15:48,085
I thought it was going downhill.
Some kind of clerk, are you?

278
00:15:48,086 --> 00:15:50,087
Account executive.

279
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:52,190
I have written to you
repeatedly in the last six months

280
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:53,625
Regarding your very
serious position.

281
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:55,660
<i>- You never replied.
- Of course not.</i>

282
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:57,662
I have learned through
bitter experience

283
00:15:57,663 --> 00:16:00,097
That acknowledging the
pettifogging outpourings

284
00:16:00,098 --> 00:16:01,599
Of pen-pushing
nobodies

285
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,968
Is unlikely to increase
the sum of human happiness.

286
00:16:03,969 --> 00:16:05,870
Mine especially.

287
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:07,972
Mr. MacDonald,
you are a very rude man.

288
00:16:07,973 --> 00:16:10,107
And you, sir,
are a very dull one.

289
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:12,811
<i>- You are also drunk!
- But I shall be sober in the morning.</i>

290
00:16:12,812 --> 00:16:15,580
Anyway, it's my prerogative.
You are standing on my land!

291
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:17,449
Not for very much longer,
I'm happy to say!

292
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,017
Mr. Fleming, take no
notice of my father-

293
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:22,487
I'm going to my room.
I shall be obliged

294
00:16:22,488 --> 00:16:25,323
If you could have a sandwich
and milk sent up to me later.

295
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:27,392
Won't you join us
for dinner?

296
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:30,161
I'll inspect your books and
accounts tomorrow morning.

297
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:33,064
We can resolve any outstanding
business shortly after that.

298
00:16:39,972 --> 00:16:41,573
( laughs )
that showed him.

299
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:43,341
Doesn't do to let
these fellows

300
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:45,343
Get the upper hand,
you know, Archie.

301
00:16:57,623 --> 00:17:00,492
- Are you okay, dougal?
- I wanted to give you this.

302
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:02,761
To make you
smell nice.

303
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:04,396
I hope you mean

304
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:06,297
To make me smell
even nicer.

305
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,300
Did you buy this
with your own money?

306
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:11,269
My mom got it
for Christmas,

307
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,805
But she doesn't like it.
I love you, miss.

308
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:26,518
Look, I'll do your deal.

309
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:29,253
You can have the land
for that gym thing.

310
00:17:29,254 --> 00:17:30,855
Go on.

311
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:33,458
Well, the thing is, um...

312
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:36,494
What are you doing tonight?

313
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:38,062
I was gonna worm the dog,

314
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:39,798
But I guess it'll keep.

315
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:43,735
<i>Katrina: I suppose it
was Golly who told you</i>

316
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:45,837
<i>I could cook books
better than a boiled egg.</i>

317
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:46,938
No comment.

318
00:17:53,546 --> 00:17:55,146
This is going
to take hours.

319
00:17:55,147 --> 00:17:57,248
It's very
good of you.

320
00:17:57,249 --> 00:17:59,116
As long as you keep
your side of the bargain.

321
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:01,453
I've given you the
word of a MacDonald.

322
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:05,122
Very reassuring.

323
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:26,678
Showing me
your best side, are ya?

324
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:28,913
Ooh! God.

325
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:31,649
I was just um...

326
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,985
Is that a pair of M &
S slacks in your hand?

327
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:35,954
Or are you just
pleased to see me?

328
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:37,856
They're wet.

329
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:39,624
<i>I was trying to turn
the radiator on.</i>

330
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,392
<i>Lexie: Ah, yes, now the heating</i>

331
00:18:41,393 --> 00:18:43,227
<i>Doesn't come on
till the first frost,</i>

332
00:18:43,228 --> 00:18:44,261
<i>Or the first
of September,</i>

333
00:18:44,262 --> 00:18:45,630
<i>Whichever
comes sooner.</i>

334
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,132
Gimme. I'll sort
them for you.

335
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:55,206
I take it you're not dining with
the Addams Family tonight then?

336
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:57,675
- Definitely not.
- Shame.

337
00:18:57,676 --> 00:18:59,844
You're missing out
on some rare fun.

338
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,181
Oh!
And thank you.

339
00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:07,051
You have shone a bright light
into the dull drabness of my day.

340
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:08,953
I have?

341
00:19:08,954 --> 00:19:13,224
It is no sight sweeter, more pregnant
with pathos and vulnerability,

342
00:19:13,225 --> 00:19:17,294
<i>Than a slender-legged gadgy, standing
in his wee y- fronts and socks.</i>

343
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:18,429
Night, night.

344
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:36,848
Archie, you know,

345
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:38,516
These are just
total rubbish.

346
00:19:38,517 --> 00:19:40,585
Be fair, they're probably
not as good as that.

347
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,388
<i>- I'm doing my best, okay?
- I'm grateful.</i>

348
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:50,862
You trained for this
sort of thing originally?

349
00:19:50,863 --> 00:19:52,997
When I first
left university,

350
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:55,633
I went to work for
a bank in Edinburgh,

351
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:57,134
Small business advisor.

352
00:19:58,637 --> 00:20:02,306
I had some great clients.
A man who gelded horses,

353
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:05,209
<i>Two brothers who made
Italian ice cream...</i>

354
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:09,113
And a very refined lady
from Morningside,

355
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:11,248
Who ran a personal
therapy center.

356
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:12,917
Oh, yeah?

357
00:20:12,918 --> 00:20:15,987
- She offered me a job.
- Is that right?

358
00:20:15,988 --> 00:20:18,155
As her business manager,
smarty pants.

359
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:20,058
And you didn't take it?

360
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,560
Those girls'd be earning
twice as much as me.

361
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:24,729
I'd have found
that very irritating.

362
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,230
Not to say tempting.

363
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:29,601
So, you became a teacher
and came back here.

364
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:31,368
What on earth
made you do that?

365
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:36,908
I just felt maybe I could make
a difference, simple as that.

366
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:39,510
Miss Jean Brodie,
you're in your prime.

367
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:41,946
Don't patronize me,
Archie MacDonald.

368
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:43,681
I'm not, I envy you.

369
00:20:43,682 --> 00:20:46,751
You seem so certain,
so sure.

370
00:20:47,953 --> 00:20:49,120
Do I?

371
00:20:51,724 --> 00:20:54,191
I don't know what
the hell I'm doing.

372
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:02,934
So...

373
00:21:02,935 --> 00:21:05,670
You're going to make a
presentation to this guy, are you?

374
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:12,043
- You toe rag!
- What?

375
00:21:12,044 --> 00:21:14,012
Increased rents
on land and properties.

376
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:16,814
It's just an idea. A way we
might increase our revenue.

377
00:21:16,815 --> 00:21:19,283
So far as I can see, rents
haven't gone up in years.

378
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:21,019
For a very good reason.

379
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,187
People couldn't
afford to pay them.

380
00:21:23,188 --> 00:21:25,757
Look, it's just for this man,
Fleming, nothing definite.

381
00:21:25,758 --> 00:21:27,625
You would say that,
wouldn't you?

382
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:29,560
Until you got what
you wanted from me.

383
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:31,328
What am I doing here?

384
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,397
I'm off.

385
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,267
<i>Leave me in the lurch,
would you?</i>

386
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:38,502
You'll survive.
Your sort always do.

387
00:21:38,503 --> 00:21:40,404
My sort? Katrina-

388
00:21:40,405 --> 00:21:42,239
Once a landlord,
always a landlord.

389
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,809
You spent too much time
with that personal therapist.

390
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,411
Gave you a wrong slant
on human nature.

391
00:21:47,412 --> 00:21:50,048
<i>And you can kiss goodbye
to that bit of land, too!</i>

392
00:21:58,157 --> 00:22:00,158
<i>( water gurgles )</i>

393
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:41,065
It's not an original.

394
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:43,667
That's in the National Gallery
in Edinburgh now.

395
00:22:43,668 --> 00:22:46,670
Hector had a copy made when
he flogged the other one.

396
00:22:46,671 --> 00:22:48,973
It paid for
central heating.

397
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:53,911
<i>Sometimes I think
I'd rather be cold.</i>

398
00:22:53,912 --> 00:22:55,980
<i>Fleming:
She's very beautiful.</i>

399
00:22:59,284 --> 00:23:01,152
Ancestor.

400
00:23:01,153 --> 00:23:03,520
Died in childbirth
when she was 27.

401
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:08,626
<i>Nightshirt okay
for you, is it?</i>

402
00:23:11,797 --> 00:23:13,765
My...

403
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:16,367
Lady Catherine's made quite an
impression on you, hasn't she?

404
00:23:18,536 --> 00:23:20,972
She reminds me
of my mother.

405
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:26,210
<i>Better get
off to bed.</i>

406
00:23:27,445 --> 00:23:29,213
Long day.

407
00:23:31,016 --> 00:23:32,683
I'll say
good night, then.

408
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,555
Oh, it's two short pulls,
and one long one, by the way.

409
00:23:40,358 --> 00:23:41,592
The lavvy.

410
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:49,767
So that's it.
All right.

411
00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:52,636
I can't leave while he's here,
but I'll be down soon.

412
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,808
<i>You're not
saying very much.</i>

413
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:58,242
What's there to say?

414
00:23:58,243 --> 00:24:00,278
<i>I mean, you're taking
it very calmly.</i>

415
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:02,479
What do you want me to do?
Get hysterical?

416
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:05,917
I wish you'd say
something.

417
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:09,287
<i>Justine?</i>

418
00:24:11,623 --> 00:24:14,125
<i>Maybe we should think about
hiring a temporary manager.</i>

419
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:16,393
- No.
- Just to tide things over.

420
00:24:16,394 --> 00:24:18,162
<i>Archie, I have to cope,</i>

421
00:24:18,163 --> 00:24:20,431
While you're off doing
your Mel Gibson thing.

422
00:24:20,432 --> 00:24:23,167
I'd rather I didn't,
but, hey, it's a tough world.

423
00:24:23,168 --> 00:24:25,369
I'll manage in my own way,
thank you very much,

424
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,039
Without the benefit of your
distant and rather fatuous advice.

425
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:31,042
Maybe we should
talk about this later.

426
00:24:31,043 --> 00:24:34,045
Yes. Later.
And then some more.

427
00:24:34,046 --> 00:24:35,646
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

428
00:24:38,817 --> 00:24:42,086
Men- sometimes you have
to wipe their bottoms,

429
00:24:42,087 --> 00:24:44,222
Sometimes you have
to kick them.

430
00:24:44,223 --> 00:24:46,123
( laughing )

431
00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:00,637
( thunderclap )

432
00:25:08,646 --> 00:25:10,381
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

433
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,752
<i>Good morning.
Hope you slept well.</i>

434
00:25:14,753 --> 00:25:17,255
I heard animals
in the night.

435
00:25:17,256 --> 00:25:19,390
Grunting, howling.

436
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:22,393
Probably just my father.
( laughs )

437
00:25:24,863 --> 00:25:26,764
I- I brought the books.

438
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:31,869
Perhaps later, you'd like
to look around the estate,

439
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,671
- Maybe try some sport?
- These will take all day.

440
00:25:34,672 --> 00:25:38,542
Anyway, I have the beginnings of a cold.

441
00:25:38,543 --> 00:25:41,212
If there's anything
you need, please shout.

442
00:25:43,181 --> 00:25:45,849
Look, I'm in
business myself,

443
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,019
And I know that
the accounts aren't...

444
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,687
All they should be.

445
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:52,589
I'm grieved
to hear it.

446
00:26:12,644 --> 00:26:15,980
Well, eight seconds
down from Monday.

447
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:17,281
Are you all right?

448
00:26:17,282 --> 00:26:19,750
I didn't sleep
too well last night.

449
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:21,352
Big race nerves.

450
00:26:21,353 --> 00:26:24,688
You are carrying the hopes
and dreams of our gender,

451
00:26:24,689 --> 00:26:26,123
The first time ever

452
00:26:26,124 --> 00:26:28,492
That women have entered
the Glenbogle Hill Race.

453
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:31,295
Another nail in the
coffin of patriarchy.

454
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,264
Me and my big mouth.

455
00:26:33,265 --> 00:26:35,433
But I've complete
faith in you, Katrina.

456
00:26:35,434 --> 00:26:37,435
You go and win it, dear.

457
00:26:37,436 --> 00:26:39,570
Win it for all
the sisters, yes!

458
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,613
( groans )

459
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:54,018
Where is
the wretched thing?

460
00:26:55,487 --> 00:26:57,388
<i>( laughing )</i>

461
00:27:05,763 --> 00:27:07,298
Everything all right?

462
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:09,200
Oh, yes. Fine.

463
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,205
( muffled chuckle )

464
00:27:27,986 --> 00:27:29,887
<i>( laughing )</i>

465
00:27:36,328 --> 00:27:38,329
The main course'll
be very simple.

466
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,297
Salmon, fresh out
of the river,

467
00:27:40,298 --> 00:27:42,299
And new potatoes
from Golly's garden,

468
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,601
In a plain,
white sauce.

469
00:27:44,602 --> 00:27:46,470
Is it disaster proof?

470
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:48,539
And what's that
supposed to mean?

471
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,207
I mean it, Lexie,
no funny business.

472
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:51,842
Our future is
in this man's hands.

473
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:57,415
Yoo-hoo. Would the
fair lady of the kitchen

474
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:58,949
Allow me
to enter her domain?

475
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,983
Come away in.

476
00:27:59,984 --> 00:28:02,053
You can enter my domain
any time you like.

477
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:03,854
Just returning
the tea things.

478
00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:07,124
I have to say, Lexie, when it
comes to scones, you are an artist.

479
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:09,260
Thanks. You'll be
staying to dinner then?

480
00:28:09,261 --> 00:28:12,363
How can I refuse? I was
wondering, my trousers?

481
00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:13,797
Oh.

482
00:28:16,234 --> 00:28:18,569
Cleaned
and pressed.

483
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,870
Thank you.

484
00:28:19,871 --> 00:28:23,541
The crease,
a thing of beauty.

485
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:25,376
Oh, why, thank you,
kind sir.

486
00:28:25,377 --> 00:28:27,545
It's nice
to be appreciated.

487
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:37,921
- Have you told him, mother?
- Yes.

488
00:28:37,922 --> 00:28:39,923
- And he knows what's expected?
- Of course.

489
00:28:39,924 --> 00:28:41,459
Will he
behave himself?

490
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,295
Look, I found it.

491
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,831
Okay, okay.

492
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:52,536
Ah, good evening.
I hope you're hungry.

493
00:28:57,809 --> 00:28:59,710
( groaning )

494
00:29:01,913 --> 00:29:03,380
This is delicious.
What is it?

495
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:04,815
Nettle and
raspberry soup

496
00:29:04,816 --> 00:29:06,650
With a sprinkling
of Orkney cheese.

497
00:29:06,651 --> 00:29:08,986
Oh, will I get stung?

498
00:29:08,987 --> 00:29:10,654
( forced laugh )

499
00:29:10,655 --> 00:29:13,790
You said it, pal.

500
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:16,260
I'd quite like some of
the pattern left on that...

501
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:17,728
If you don't mind.

502
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:25,569
- Enjoy that, did you, Hector?
- It smells of wet dog.

503
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,506
- And I love you, too.
- ( Fleming chuckles )

504
00:29:28,507 --> 00:29:29,873
Isn't she wonderful?

505
00:29:29,874 --> 00:29:34,145
Feisty, witty, a brilliant
cook, but tasty herself.

506
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:35,513
<i>( laughing, snorts )</i>

507
00:29:35,514 --> 00:29:38,382
Anyway, you were saying
about the books?

508
00:29:38,383 --> 00:29:40,151
The boo-?
The books, yes.

509
00:29:40,152 --> 00:29:41,652
Yes, well,
they're very good.

510
00:29:41,653 --> 00:29:44,888
They convey a very accurate
picture of the enterprise.

511
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:46,990
Yes, I was rather
afraid of that.

512
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:50,761
Which is, if the Glenbogle
estate were a wet dog-

513
00:29:50,762 --> 00:29:53,497
To take your analogy,
Mr. MacDonald-

514
00:29:53,498 --> 00:29:55,466
The most humane course
of action would be

515
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:58,302
To rub it down with an old towel
and shoot the mutt.

516
00:29:58,303 --> 00:30:00,571
( laughing )

517
00:30:07,045 --> 00:30:08,345
- How's it going?
- All right.

518
00:30:08,346 --> 00:30:10,181
These are
for Molly and Hector.

519
00:30:10,182 --> 00:30:11,982
You get the others.

520
00:30:11,983 --> 00:30:14,218
Which one's his?
The gowk in the suit?

521
00:30:14,219 --> 00:30:16,253
That one there.
The biggest portion.

522
00:30:19,357 --> 00:30:20,357
Right.

523
00:30:20,358 --> 00:30:22,025
I'll give you tasty.

524
00:30:24,862 --> 00:30:26,597
Pinstriped prat.

525
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:31,768
<i>Archie: Look, I can't disagree with you.</i>

526
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:32,903
<i>I run my
own business.</i>

527
00:30:32,904 --> 00:30:34,438
Did I
mention that?

528
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:36,073
And I know that
this estate

529
00:30:36,074 --> 00:30:39,310
Hasn't been run
on very professional lines.

530
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:40,877
That's all right,
don't mind me.

531
00:30:40,878 --> 00:30:42,213
Just pretend
I don't exist.

532
00:30:42,214 --> 00:30:43,714
<i>Archie:
But the thing is,</i>

533
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:46,149
<i>I believe there is something
here worth fighting for.</i>

534
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,585
Salmon.

535
00:30:47,586 --> 00:30:49,620
Caught this morning
from the River Bogle,

536
00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:52,423
Lightly poached
with a plain white sauce.

537
00:30:52,424 --> 00:30:53,390
Lovely.

538
00:30:55,927 --> 00:30:57,595
Sorry, you were saying?

539
00:30:57,596 --> 00:31:01,865
<i>I- we have great plans
for developing Glenbogle.</i>

540
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:04,235
For giving it life,
making it prosper.

541
00:31:04,236 --> 00:31:06,970
But how could you possibly
generate the income?

542
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:08,905
We- we have all
sorts of ideas.

543
00:31:08,906 --> 00:31:13,110
- Luxury foodstuffs for one.
- Height of vulgarity.

544
00:31:13,111 --> 00:31:14,511
A corporate retreat.

545
00:31:14,512 --> 00:31:17,548
Senior managers
brain-storming business strategy

546
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:20,150
In the unique environment
of this fantastic old house.

547
00:31:20,151 --> 00:31:22,586
And what about the aged residents
of this fantastic old house?

548
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:26,022
- Hector! - Your father obviously
doesn't share your vision.

549
00:31:26,023 --> 00:31:27,891
I run Glenbogle,
Mr. Fleming, not my father.

550
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:31,528
Well, I'm sorry,
it's not gonna happen.

551
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:34,798
<i>At least not
with my bank's money.</i>

552
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,269
<i>- This looks delicious.
- Turn it into some wretched B & B,</i>

553
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,671
And the place'll be full
of oiks like this fellow,

554
00:31:40,672 --> 00:31:42,806
<i>Dropping his h's
all over the shop.</i>

555
00:31:48,112 --> 00:31:49,913
( coughing )

556
00:31:52,317 --> 00:31:53,950
Mr. Fleming?

557
00:31:55,553 --> 00:31:57,888
What's the matter?

558
00:31:57,889 --> 00:31:59,390
I've been poisoned.

559
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:09,132
I think I'm
gonna be sick.

560
00:32:13,905 --> 00:32:16,239
<i>( retching )</i>

561
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,108
Oh, mine tastes fine.

562
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:20,277
Girl's pulled one out
of the bag at last.

563
00:32:25,383 --> 00:32:26,583
No more.

564
00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:29,320
Unless you can give
me a check for �100,000

565
00:32:29,321 --> 00:32:31,655
As a clear indication of
your ability and willingness

566
00:32:31,656 --> 00:32:33,791
To clear the estate's indebtedness,

567
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,360
The bank will take steps
to protect its position.

568
00:32:36,361 --> 00:32:38,495
Can you write me
such a check?

569
00:32:41,433 --> 00:32:43,567
Of course not.

570
00:32:43,568 --> 00:32:45,769
Very well.

571
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,137
So be it.

572
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:50,874
Excuse me.

573
00:32:53,945 --> 00:32:55,212
Right.

574
00:32:55,213 --> 00:32:56,814
Yes, my man!

575
00:32:56,815 --> 00:33:00,083
<i>- Get in! Get right in!
- What's up with you?</i>

576
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:01,852
Medication wearing off?

577
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:06,022
Jokes are one thing, I can
take as many as you throw down.

578
00:33:06,023 --> 00:33:08,692
But sabotage
is another.

579
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:10,894
This is probably meaningless,
but what the hell?

580
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:13,263
- You're sacked.
- Archie!

581
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:22,339
Right. Start talking, slabhead.

582
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,975
I did it for you, honest,
to show I cared.

583
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:26,643
<i>( thuds, screams )</i>

584
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:51,802
Molly: Now does
everyone know what to do?

585
00:33:51,803 --> 00:33:53,470
Right.
Let's go.

586
00:33:53,471 --> 00:33:56,507
And, guys, be careful out there, okay?

587
00:33:56,508 --> 00:33:58,241
I've always wanted
to say that.

588
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:01,912
Molly?
Molly?

589
00:34:03,247 --> 00:34:05,315
What are we gonna
do about the money?

590
00:34:05,316 --> 00:34:07,618
Ah, well, I have
a cunning plan.

591
00:34:12,724 --> 00:34:16,593
Hey, big boy.
Wakey-wakey.

592
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:20,263
- Lexie.
- You feeling better?

593
00:34:20,264 --> 00:34:22,800
Now, you're going
to eat the nice breakfast

594
00:34:22,801 --> 00:34:24,568
That I prepared
for you.

595
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:27,638
Then you and I are going to go
off on a little jaunt together.

596
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,774
<i>- But I-I have to get
back to- - oh, really?</i>

597
00:34:30,775 --> 00:34:33,911
Life that exciting
in Hanwell, or Ealing even?

598
00:34:35,112 --> 00:34:36,814
Lexie doesn't
offer herself

599
00:34:36,815 --> 00:34:39,182
<i>To any old Tom, Dick,
or Archie, you know.</i>

600
00:34:40,652 --> 00:34:41,952
Right.

601
00:34:41,953 --> 00:34:43,520
I'll meet you
by the bike sheds

602
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:45,789
In 10 minutes,
Fleming.

603
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,958
Or should I call you
Flem for short?

604
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:01,905
My man.

605
00:35:01,906 --> 00:35:03,974
<i>My poor
wee man.</i>

606
00:35:03,975 --> 00:35:05,776
You ready
for adventure?

607
00:35:05,777 --> 00:35:07,911
Jump on.
We'll head for the hills.

608
00:35:07,912 --> 00:35:09,947
( engine starts )

609
00:35:12,817 --> 00:35:14,050
This is Golly,
by the way,

610
00:35:14,051 --> 00:35:16,419
The best hunter this side
of the Rockies.

611
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,154
Nice to meet you,
Golly.

612
00:35:23,495 --> 00:35:25,629
Molly: Is that honest Bob McDougall?

613
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,163
Now then, my man,

614
00:35:27,164 --> 00:35:28,866
I gather you've
got a book open

615
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:30,901
On the Glenbogle
hill race?

616
00:35:30,902 --> 00:35:33,169
Good, 'cause I'd like
to make a very large bet.

617
00:35:34,271 --> 00:35:35,271
Five thousand.

618
00:35:35,272 --> 00:35:38,742
Yes, that's right,
5,000.

619
00:35:41,178 --> 00:35:43,480
Have you seen our
executioner this morning?

620
00:35:43,481 --> 00:35:46,416
You missed him, he's gone.
Where in heaven's name is Lexie?

621
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:48,418
She's gone, too.
Archie sacked her.

622
00:35:48,419 --> 00:35:50,888
- You'll have to make your own breakfast.
- What?!

623
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:52,890
- You're going to be late.
- Late for what?

624
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:54,424
The hill race,
silly.

625
00:35:54,425 --> 00:35:56,527
Yes, let's all go on
a fun run. Most timely.

626
00:35:56,528 --> 00:35:58,495
We're all washed up,
but what the heck?

627
00:35:58,496 --> 00:36:00,931
I suppose you want me to
wear a silly costume, too.

628
00:36:00,932 --> 00:36:02,533
What is it, the back end of a horse?

629
00:36:02,534 --> 00:36:04,134
Clown outfit might
be appropriate.

630
00:36:04,135 --> 00:36:06,069
But you used to love
athletics at school.

631
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,804
Only when I was
trying to run away.

632
00:36:07,805 --> 00:36:09,305
Katrina said
you'd chicken out.

633
00:36:09,306 --> 00:36:11,708
She used to run for the
Scottish universities.

634
00:36:11,709 --> 00:36:13,944
Please. Put on
your shorts and run.

635
00:36:13,945 --> 00:36:16,980
Just do this
for your silly old mum, hmm?

636
00:36:21,452 --> 00:36:22,886
I've got the bread.

637
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:25,088
Now all we need is
some means of toasting it.

638
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:28,959
Are you sure
these will be okay?

639
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,393
Listen, Dunc,
I've come across

640
00:36:30,394 --> 00:36:33,030
A few intellectually
challenged creatures in my time,

641
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:35,198
But these trout
are truly cretinous.

642
00:36:58,723 --> 00:37:00,256
Lexie: Yee-ha!

643
00:37:18,943 --> 00:37:20,644
I've never been
fishing before.

644
00:37:20,645 --> 00:37:21,778
Neither have I.

645
00:37:21,779 --> 00:37:23,714
Least not
in a river.

646
00:37:23,715 --> 00:37:25,348
Careful, man,
you'll frighten the fish.

647
00:37:49,206 --> 00:37:51,207
Come on.

648
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:53,744
Off you go.
Good boy.

649
00:37:53,745 --> 00:37:55,746
Ah, good luck,
my boy.

650
00:37:55,747 --> 00:37:57,147
Thank you.

651
00:37:57,148 --> 00:37:59,082
- I want you to wear this.
- What is it?

652
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:01,184
MacDonald of Glenbogle's
tam-o'- shanter.

653
00:38:01,185 --> 00:38:03,620
The fifth Laird
wore it at Culloden,

654
00:38:03,621 --> 00:38:06,189
<i>When he escaped the
clutches of the Redcoats.</i>

655
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,058
The very event we're
commemorating today.

656
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:10,794
<i>- It's filthy.
- It's history.</i>

657
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:13,563
If this is the last time a
MacDonald runs in the hill race,

658
00:38:13,564 --> 00:38:14,965
It must be worn.

659
00:38:14,966 --> 00:38:17,100
To complete the ancient
and venerated circle.

660
00:38:17,101 --> 00:38:19,002
- Exactly, Kilwillie.
- All right.

661
00:38:20,504 --> 00:38:22,305
Good boy.

662
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:29,412
It's okay. You can play
with him till he's silly.

663
00:38:29,413 --> 00:38:31,815
- He's loving it.
- Oh, my goodness.

664
00:38:31,816 --> 00:38:33,583
I'm touching him.

665
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:36,053
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

666
00:38:38,255 --> 00:38:40,123
I'm tickling him.

667
00:38:40,124 --> 00:38:41,825
I'm tickling
a bloody trout.

668
00:38:41,826 --> 00:38:44,494
Go on,
you can do it.

669
00:38:44,495 --> 00:38:46,563
Net, Lexie.

670
00:38:46,564 --> 00:38:48,932
( shrieks, laughing )

671
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,004
Right, that's
that then.

672
00:38:56,107 --> 00:38:57,774
I've got
things to do.

673
00:39:00,578 --> 00:39:02,746
Oh, my man.

674
00:39:02,747 --> 00:39:04,881
My hunter.

675
00:39:04,882 --> 00:39:06,717
I caught a fish
with my bare hands.

676
00:39:06,718 --> 00:39:09,285
Oh, Lexie, I don't know. I felt special.

677
00:39:09,286 --> 00:39:10,954
You are special,
wee man.

678
00:39:10,955 --> 00:39:14,024
Oh, Lexie, I'm having
such a wonderful day.

679
00:39:14,025 --> 00:39:15,692
That's 'cause
you're pished.

680
00:39:15,693 --> 00:39:17,260
You'll soon get
used to it.

681
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:24,968
<i>Woman: What, what have
I let myself in for?</i>

682
00:39:33,111 --> 00:39:35,112
Duncan?

683
00:39:35,113 --> 00:39:36,880
Oh, my sponsors
insisted.

684
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:39,582
- Who's that then?
- Wallace's garage.

685
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:41,584
Listen, boss,
about the other night,

686
00:39:41,585 --> 00:39:43,386
It wasn't really
Lexie's fault-

687
00:39:43,387 --> 00:39:45,588
<i>Announcer: Please move
to the starting line.</i>

688
00:39:46,724 --> 00:39:48,424
<i>This is the last call.</i>

689
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:49,726
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

690
00:39:49,727 --> 00:39:50,961
<i>Would all competitors</i>

691
00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:52,829
<i>Please take their
places at the start?</i>

692
00:39:54,665 --> 00:39:57,901
Very nice. You look like an
extra from "Chariots of Fire. "

693
00:39:57,902 --> 00:40:00,170
I'll soon burn you off,
just you watch.

694
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:02,505
- Dream on, pal.
- A word, son.

695
00:40:02,506 --> 00:40:04,374
<i>- Not now.
- Now.</i>

696
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:07,110
<i>Would all competitors please
take their places at the start?</i>

697
00:40:07,111 --> 00:40:08,812
Your ma has put
a bet on the race.

698
00:40:08,813 --> 00:40:10,180
Big money.

699
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:11,414
What, on me?

700
00:40:11,415 --> 00:40:13,750
On Katrina.
Right?

701
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:15,385
So you just
make sure she wins.

702
00:40:15,386 --> 00:40:17,453
Okay?

703
00:40:17,454 --> 00:40:18,822
You want me
to throw the race?

704
00:40:18,823 --> 00:40:21,057
<i>Well, I won't,
I've had enough.</i>

705
00:40:21,058 --> 00:40:23,559
No, this is where Archie
MacDonald makes his last stand.

706
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,695
Even if it turns out
to be Little Big Horn.

707
00:40:25,696 --> 00:40:26,763
<i>Away you go!</i>

708
00:40:31,002 --> 00:40:32,936
Come on, Duncan.
Come on.

709
00:40:39,376 --> 00:40:41,011
There he is.
Archie, come on.

710
00:40:41,012 --> 00:40:43,680
Come on, my boy.
Run hard, run true.

711
00:41:16,047 --> 00:41:18,715
- Can't cope, eh?
- Just pacing myself.

712
00:41:56,787 --> 00:41:58,488
( laughing )

713
00:42:05,363 --> 00:42:07,797
Oh, Lexie, this is the
specialest day of my life.

714
00:42:07,798 --> 00:42:09,599
I don't want
to work in a bank.

715
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,935
I want to live here, in a wee cottage,

716
00:42:11,936 --> 00:42:14,070
And you could
have my children.

717
00:42:14,071 --> 00:42:15,772
And I could
be a lumberjack

718
00:42:15,773 --> 00:42:17,640
And breathe in
the fresh air

719
00:42:17,641 --> 00:42:20,476
And chop logs,
with a chopper.

720
00:42:20,477 --> 00:42:22,512
Oh, Flem,
you're a crazy guy.

721
00:42:22,513 --> 00:42:24,680
I am,
I'm crazy for you.

722
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:27,083
There isn't anybody
like you in Ealing.

723
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:29,152
Oh, Lexie,
you're the most

724
00:42:29,153 --> 00:42:31,021
Wonderful girl
I've ever met.

725
00:42:31,022 --> 00:42:33,856
Apart from my own
darling mother.

726
00:42:33,857 --> 00:42:36,793
May I kiss you? I
should like to very much.

727
00:42:38,595 --> 00:42:40,797
Okay.

728
00:42:40,798 --> 00:42:42,999
But...
No tongues, mind.

729
00:43:03,387 --> 00:43:05,521
( screaming )

730
00:43:05,522 --> 00:43:07,523
Duncan?

731
00:43:09,961 --> 00:43:11,861
I'm gonna kill you!

732
00:43:13,764 --> 00:43:16,099
Come on then,
I'll fight you for her.

733
00:43:19,236 --> 00:43:21,237
Touch her again and you'll
get a double dose.

734
00:43:21,238 --> 00:43:23,406
Duncan, I'm not gonna
tell you again!

735
00:43:23,407 --> 00:43:24,807
<i>I warned you about that.
I mean it.</i>

736
00:43:30,247 --> 00:43:32,648
<i>- I've told you before!
- Lexie!</i>

737
00:43:36,153 --> 00:43:38,121
Ah, help!

738
00:43:42,093 --> 00:43:44,060
Flem...
Archie!

739
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,831
Help me,
I'm going down.

740
00:43:48,832 --> 00:43:50,533
Oh, dear, what a shame.

741
00:43:50,534 --> 00:43:52,469
Help me, please.
I'm going to die.

742
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:54,237
Sorry, I'm in
a race just now.

743
00:43:54,238 --> 00:43:56,639
<i>Fleming: Archie, please,
please, I'm drowning.</i>

744
00:44:00,277 --> 00:44:01,978
Here, grab my hand.
That's it.

745
00:44:13,124 --> 00:44:14,624
I could use this,
you know.

746
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:18,461
A less scrupulous man would,
you know what I mean?

747
00:44:18,462 --> 00:44:20,930
Archie, come on,
you can win this.

748
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:22,698
I told you
I'd catch you.

749
00:44:38,882 --> 00:44:40,250
Who is it?

750
00:44:40,251 --> 00:44:42,218
<i>Hector:
Come on, boy.</i>

751
00:44:44,422 --> 00:44:45,355
Katrina.

752
00:44:54,131 --> 00:44:55,498
Suffering there,
are you?

753
00:44:55,499 --> 00:44:57,434
Just doing
what I'm told.

754
00:44:57,435 --> 00:44:59,735
I'll tell you what,
I'll let you win,

755
00:44:59,736 --> 00:45:01,704
If you give me
that bit of land.

756
00:45:01,705 --> 00:45:03,173
<i>Archie:
I'll beat you.</i>

757
00:45:03,174 --> 00:45:04,807
I'm faster
than you.

758
00:45:04,808 --> 00:45:06,909
Sassenachs
beaten again.

759
00:45:10,681 --> 00:45:12,182
I'm as Scottish
as you are.

760
00:45:12,183 --> 00:45:15,185
Ha, you Scottish? Whoa!

761
00:45:15,186 --> 00:45:16,886
Katrina!

762
00:45:19,457 --> 00:45:21,291
- Katrina, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

763
00:45:24,528 --> 00:45:27,063
- Come on.
- Go on, you can still win.

764
00:45:41,145 --> 00:45:42,612
Jolly sporting
of the boy.

765
00:45:42,613 --> 00:45:44,481
His ancestors would
be proud of him.

766
00:45:44,482 --> 00:45:46,449
Yes, it was a good show.

767
00:45:57,961 --> 00:46:00,630
<i>Announcer: The winner of this
year's Glenbogle Hill Race.</i>

768
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:05,701
Welcome
to Planet Glenbogle.

769
00:46:11,509 --> 00:46:13,409
( loud cheering )

770
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,156
Nice one, Duncan.
Shame about the costume.

771
00:46:32,363 --> 00:46:33,963
<i>Fleming:
Well done.</i>

772
00:46:33,964 --> 00:46:35,831
<i>Archie: And the winner
of the women's race</i>

773
00:46:35,832 --> 00:46:38,134
And equal second,
Katrina Finley.

774
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,708
Well done.

775
00:46:48,078 --> 00:46:49,512
Oh, and by the way,
Katrina,

776
00:46:49,513 --> 00:46:51,947
You can have that land
for the school.

777
00:46:51,948 --> 00:46:54,584
( cheering )

778
00:46:54,585 --> 00:46:56,118
Thank you
very much, Archie.

779
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:58,254
And we weren't equal
second by the way.

780
00:46:58,255 --> 00:47:00,056
I crossed
the line first.

781
00:47:00,057 --> 00:47:02,124
It's a mere
technicality.

782
00:47:05,196 --> 00:47:07,497
Well done, Arch.

783
00:47:07,498 --> 00:47:09,932
Can I just say sorry? I
don't really want you to go.

784
00:47:09,933 --> 00:47:11,867
Oh, I'm not going
anywhere, boy.

785
00:47:11,868 --> 00:47:13,736
Now hush your mouth
and give us a kiss.

786
00:47:18,209 --> 00:47:19,542
Give him
a kiss, girls.

787
00:47:19,543 --> 00:47:22,345
Go on.
Lovely.

788
00:47:22,346 --> 00:47:24,013
And again.

789
00:47:26,116 --> 00:47:27,483
Thank you.

790
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,287
Justine.

791
00:47:31,288 --> 00:47:33,723
You've kissed virtually
every woman in Scotland.

792
00:47:33,724 --> 00:47:35,258
Aren't you going
to give me one?

793
00:47:49,072 --> 00:47:51,441
- You could have stayed, you know.
- Stayed?

794
00:47:51,442 --> 00:47:52,908
I've been
insulted.

795
00:47:52,909 --> 00:47:54,043
I've been
poisoned,

796
00:47:54,044 --> 00:47:55,778
Assaulted
by a mad Pict

797
00:47:55,779 --> 00:47:57,813
And chased
into a river.

798
00:47:57,814 --> 00:47:59,915
I've ruined
a good suit.

799
00:47:59,916 --> 00:48:01,584
I nearly died.

800
00:48:01,585 --> 00:48:03,319
I'm sorry.

801
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,854
I've had the time
of my life, Archie.

802
00:48:07,023 --> 00:48:09,292
The bank will give you
another six months.

803
00:48:09,293 --> 00:48:12,695
We'll extend the
overdraft by another 75k.

804
00:48:12,696 --> 00:48:17,433
- Make the most of it.
- Thank you very much.

805
00:48:17,434 --> 00:48:20,336
Tell Lexie,
it's Lancelot.

806
00:48:20,337 --> 00:48:22,772
- Hmm?
- My name.

807

<i>( train approaches,

808
00:48:29,313 --> 00:48:30,846
Right.

809

We need to talk...

810
00:48:32,483 --> 00:48:33,716
