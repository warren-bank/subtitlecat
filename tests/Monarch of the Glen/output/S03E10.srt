1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,066
And...

2
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:08,337
fetch!

3
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:11,273
<i>( dog barks )</i>

4
00:00:12,342 --> 00:00:14,509
I'll explain it
once more.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,613
Now when I throw the ball-
see, made of rubber, round-

6
00:00:17,614 --> 00:00:20,148
that's the ball.
When I throw it over there

7
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:22,351
you run after it, pick it up,
bring it back to me.

8
00:00:22,352 --> 00:00:24,819
All right?
Quite simple.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,855
And...

10
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:28,457
fetch.

11
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:34,229
You see, fetching
is what dogs do.

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,665
<i>It's a service performed
by canus familiaris,</i>

13
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,167
that's latin for "dog. "
It's what you do-

14
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:42,003
you've always done since all
of us lived in caves together.

15
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:45,274
It's quite simple. Don't
think about it, just do it.

16
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:46,975
Do it.

17
00:00:46,976 --> 00:00:48,977
( dog whimpers )

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,615
And... fetch.

19
00:00:57,853 --> 00:01:02,323
- I can see you're going to be trouble.
- ( whimpers )

20
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:05,226
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

21
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:08,757
( coughing )

22
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:12,293
( tires squeal )

23
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:20,001
I think we should
tell them. don't you?

24
00:02:20,002 --> 00:02:23,938
No, the moment is
just us, you know?

25
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:26,575
Doesn't belong
to anyone else.

26
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:28,643
I like that.

27
00:02:28,644 --> 00:02:31,079
Yeah, but I want
the whole world to know.

28
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,215
How do you think
they'll take it?

29
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:36,718
They'll be thrilled to
bits. How could they not be?

30
00:02:39,622 --> 00:02:42,090
Okay.

31
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:45,226
Let's do it.

32
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:47,796
( Hector, garbled )
... now also like that

33
00:02:47,797 --> 00:02:50,932
and you drop it.

34
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:53,568
All right,
did you get that?

35
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:56,638
- Hector, come inside.
- ( dog whimpers )

36
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,173
Archie's got some sort
of announcement to make.

37
00:02:59,174 --> 00:03:00,842
( mumbling )
In a minute.

38
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:03,344
( continues to mumble )

39
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:07,783
...like that.

40
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:12,554
Well, I solved the problem
of what to call you.

41
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:15,089
Come on then, "Useless. "

42
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:20,128
( whimpers and barks )

43
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:22,096
I hope this is not
going to take too long.

44
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:24,165
I've got a map to pick
up from the library.

45
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,968
I give a talk
to the golf club ladies

46
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:29,370
on a new approach
to sand wedge design.

47
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:32,140
And I am going
fishing with "Useless. "

48
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:35,143
I've got something to do as
well. It's quite important.

49
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:37,879
Well, shouldn't take
too long, should it?

50
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,881
To say just seven words.

51
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:41,750
- Eight.
- What?

52
00:03:41,751 --> 00:03:44,953
<i>- Archie: the thing is-
- ( honking )</i>

53
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:48,122
No, it can't be.
It is.

54
00:03:48,123 --> 00:03:52,461
- Hector, it's Joe.
- Hector: Hell.

55
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:57,699
Will you excuse me?
There's something

56
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,069
more interesting
happening outside.

57
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:05,073
"Lexie and I are
going to get married. "

58
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:09,077
You're right,
it is eight words.

59
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:10,612
Joe!

60
00:04:11,948 --> 00:04:13,915
Joe!

61
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:17,519
My lovely,
lovely Joe!

62
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,054
Sweet,
sweet sister.

63
00:04:20,055 --> 00:04:23,925
It's wonderful to see you. I
can't believe it. Can you, Hector?

64
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:26,528
- Unbelievable.
- Hello, "what the heck"?

65
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:30,365
Still got the jerk in
the casting arm, have we?

66
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:33,034
- Who is it?
- My uncle Jolyon.

67
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:35,504
<i>Fresh from the hills of East
Africa by the looks of it.</i>

68
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:38,940
<i>Molly: What are you doing here?
You haven't been back in years.</i>

69
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:42,477
- No, decades.
- Come to see you, what else?

70
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:44,813
Can't be-
Archibald.

71
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:47,015
Uncle Joe,
welcome.

72
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:49,050
You've come
at a very good time.

73
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:50,418
I'd like you to meet-

74
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:52,554
could you be careful
of those, young lad?

75
00:04:52,555 --> 00:04:53,955
Let me take that
for you.

76
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:55,323
Thank you.

77
00:04:55,324 --> 00:04:59,528
<i>Very interesting uniforms
your staff wear these days.</i>

78
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:01,095
( clucking )

79
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:12,941
My butler
was Moses Elijah.

80
00:05:12,942 --> 00:05:17,211
He nursed me when
I had "Onjamin Tummy. "

81
00:05:17,212 --> 00:05:19,614
Protected me
from rogue merchants

82
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:22,817
and rogue elephants.

83
00:05:22,818 --> 00:05:25,687
No thanks, I'm not hungry. But Hector,

84
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:28,523
<i>- ( crystal rings )
- I'm a bit thirsty.</i>

85
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:32,060
You always were, Jolyon.
That is my recollection of you.

86
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:34,863
Speaking
of servants, Molly,

87
00:05:34,864 --> 00:05:36,898
why is it that your staff

88
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:39,601
appears to be taking
lunch with us?

89
00:05:39,602 --> 00:05:41,803
Joe, they're our friends.

90
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:45,707
This is Golly, Duncan,
and Lexie.

91
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,143
How extraordinary.

92
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:51,112
- Are you staying long?
- Hector?

93
00:05:51,113 --> 00:05:54,816
I don't like to think of his plantation
going to wrack and ruin in his absence.

94
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:57,485
They're about as big
as Luxembourg, are they?

95
00:05:57,486 --> 00:05:59,520
It's Denmark, actually.

96
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:03,124
<i>A chap should come home and
see his loved ones quite often.</i>

97
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,894
I can give Archie
a bit of help,

98
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:07,862
<i>seeing as you've been
put out to grass.</i>

99
00:06:07,863 --> 00:06:09,664
Thank you very much.

100
00:06:09,665 --> 00:06:13,034
How pleasant to be in the
capacious bosom of one's family.

101
00:06:15,638 --> 00:06:17,939
I've actually got
a toast myself...

102
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:21,109
<i>concerning...</i>

103
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,211
the capacious whatsit
of one's family.

104
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:29,450
Lexie and I
are going to be married.

105
00:06:32,554 --> 00:06:34,355
Here's my engagement ring
to prove it.

106
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,935
Isn't this where
you're all supposed to say-

107
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:50,238
"congratulations, hope
you'll both be very happy"?

108
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,806
Er...

109
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:56,244
you're joking,
aren't you?

110
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:59,748
Darlings, darlings,
this is-

111
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:03,718
what, son and heir
marrying the housemaid?

112
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:05,987
Please, Lexie is
my fianc�e.

113
00:07:05,988 --> 00:07:08,589
And a very good friend
of everyone here.

114
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:14,362
Well, father?

115
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,568
Archie, Lexie,
this is a grave mistake.

116
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:23,138
<i>I fear it can only
end in tears.</i>

117
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:28,943
Well, thanks. Thanks
very much, all of you.

118
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:31,112
<i>Can I just say,
you can stuff your lunch?</i>

119
00:07:31,113 --> 00:07:33,748
I'll just go back
to the kitchen where I belong.

120
00:07:56,172 --> 00:07:59,174
It was a disaster.

121
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:02,177
- Come on.
- Your uncle thought it was preposterous.

122
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:04,645
Your dad thought it was
an affront to his lineage.

123
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:07,348
- Just you leave them to me.
- Duncan thought it was a joke.

124
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:10,051
And Golly was silent
even by his standards.

125
00:08:10,052 --> 00:08:12,153
Oh god,
even your mum.

126
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:14,055
The only thing that
matters is how we feel.

127
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:15,890
What people think
isn't important.

128
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:18,727
Really?
You're family.

129
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:21,662
The only real family
that I've ever had.

130
00:08:21,663 --> 00:08:26,201
Our friends?
I don't think so.

131
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:32,173
( sobs )

132
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:37,078
- Hector, I'm appalled-
- so am I.

133
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:39,513
At your behavior. What on
earth were you thinking of?

134
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:42,984
- Our boy and Lexie too.
- Fiddlesticks! you've got the manners of a warthog,

135
00:08:42,985 --> 00:08:44,919
and the sensitivity
of Arthur's seat.

136
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,522
I sometimes wonder what possessed me to
hitch my wagon to your broken old train.

137
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:50,759
I refuse to be insulted
in my house.

138
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,361
Would you rather be insulted
in someone else's house?

139
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:55,429
- That could be arranged.
- I'm going fishing.

140
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,665
- Joe: What a capital idea.
- Come on, Useless.

141
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:00,434
Coming.

142
00:09:01,637 --> 00:09:04,005
Not you!
Oh, forget it.

143
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:07,976
( barking )

144
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,993
I think...
this is yours.

145
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:30,832
Thanks, I would have been
grieved to lose the blighter.

146
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,967
I shot him up
at Murchison Falls.

147
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:35,003
I was standing behind
a baobab tree-

148
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:38,673
have you any idea
of the grief I'm going to get

149
00:09:38,674 --> 00:09:41,843
when this gets round
to headquarters, you maniac?

150
00:09:41,844 --> 00:09:44,145
<i>Look, dogberry,
is it?</i>

151
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:47,148
Don't take that
high-handed tone with me.

152
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:49,150
You've asked for it.

153
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:51,652
You're coming down
to the station with me.

154
00:09:51,653 --> 00:09:53,988
Can I? a word
in your ear?

155
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:58,059
This chap is Molly's
brother, Jolyon.

156
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,394
He's been in Africa
about 40 years.

157
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:03,097
Rich as Croesus,
but not used to our ways.

158
00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:06,000
Unlike you,
Mr. MacDonald.

159
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:07,735
( chuckles )

160
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:12,673
He's a bit of a dinosaur
but quite harmless.

161
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:14,608
I can vouch for his
behavior, is that all right?

162
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:19,914
Fair enough.

163
00:10:34,396 --> 00:10:39,734
Joe: I would often pop over
to Uganda and fish the Nile.

164
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:43,872
Sometimes the perch,
they get up to 90 pounds.

165
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,607
Wow!

166
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:51,779
Afternoon, giving your trout
a fit of the giggles?

167
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,015
They'll be laughing so much
at your casting you'll be

168
00:10:54,016 --> 00:10:56,717
able to pick them out of the
water with a pair of tweezers.

169
00:10:56,718 --> 00:10:59,754
Cats and puddles,
Kilwillie.

170
00:10:59,755 --> 00:11:02,723
We'll see how your jibes
sound at the end of the day.

171
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:08,296
What's he doing
lurking around my loch?

172
00:11:08,297 --> 00:11:12,066
What specimen
of muddy puddle

173
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:15,336
- do we have here, Hector?
- Pretty tame stuff.

174
00:11:15,337 --> 00:11:17,538
Compared with what
you're used to, Mr. Joe.

175
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:20,008
What do you know
about it, Duncan?

176
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:22,476
You couldn't catch raindrops
with an upturned umbrella.

177
00:11:22,477 --> 00:11:24,478
<i>The beasts in this loch
aren't like those</i>

178
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:27,315
bloated things that flop
into your nets in the tropics.

179
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:31,419
They're packed with muscle and sinew,
and sheer scots bloodymindedness.

180
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,955
Finest water for brown
trout in the British Isles.

181
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:35,256
And it's all mine.

182
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:37,992
Let battle commence.

183
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:42,030
I've been thinking.

184
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:44,665
So have I,
about patricide.

185
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,335
I know.

186
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:49,103
I could
kill them, too.

187
00:11:51,473 --> 00:11:53,707
But all that's
a waste of time.

188
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:57,011
We just have to do
what's right for us.

189
00:11:57,012 --> 00:11:58,413
I meant what I said.

190
00:11:58,414 --> 00:12:00,982
If people here can't accept
that we love each other

191
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:04,652
and we want to get married, then we'll
just have to do it somewhere else.

192
00:12:04,653 --> 00:12:07,855
Run away, you mean?
Gretna Green or something?

193
00:12:07,856 --> 00:12:10,591
I know it's not
what we planned-

194
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:13,127
the church on the hill,
the fairy tale castle.

195
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:18,299
No, but you're right.

196
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,602
That's just
a lot of fluff.

197
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:24,405
We could get married
on the bridge

198
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:27,875
and I wouldn't care
as long as we're together.

199
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:33,948
Right.
Let's show 'em, then.

200
00:12:36,418 --> 00:12:38,719
( Duncan sings )

201
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,457
( Duncan whistles )

202
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,924
Duncan, please.

203
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:50,465
This is fun. we'll soon
be needing a flashlight

204
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:52,867
to see all the fish
we're not catching.

205
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:54,869
( laughs )

206
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,106
Duncan, would you be so kind
as to pack up the gear?

207
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:02,977
I apologize for the paucity
of this evening's sport.

208
00:13:02,978 --> 00:13:05,279
That's all right,
old son.

209
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,149
I've enjoyed it in a funny sort of way.

210
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,551
I can't understand it.
This loch was teaming

211
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:12,820
with trout of the most
remarkable quality.

212
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:15,289
Sorry, what the heck,
I think she's fished out.

213
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:19,260
Come on, Useless.

214
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:21,462
( whimpers )

215
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:23,998
I said, come on.

216
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:27,435
Uggh!

217
00:13:34,076 --> 00:13:36,077
Give me that a minute.
Will you, Golly?

218
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:38,612
( grunting )

219
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:40,981
There, that's better.

220
00:13:40,982 --> 00:13:43,351
You hang on
in there, laddie.

221
00:13:43,352 --> 00:13:47,255
I'd like to wish the pair of
you all the luck in the world.

222
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:49,424
Thank you.

223
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:53,994
Did you get that map?

224
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:55,829
Yep.

225
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,199
It's there, Archie.

226
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,101
It's there

227
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:02,336
by the old sawmill.

228
00:14:02,337 --> 00:14:05,940
I knew it.

229
00:14:05,941 --> 00:14:08,309
Get everything we need.
We'll start in the morning.

230
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,078
Give the bride a surprise.

231
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:14,315
<i>Recording:
�... I shout it �</i>

232
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:18,986
<i>� from the highest hills... �</i>

233
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:23,057
what are you
doing, Duncan?

234
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:26,094
Hi, Mr. Joe.

235
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:28,729
Molly told me
to put your stuff in here.

236
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,899
Check this out,

237
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,802
the music scene must have
been rubbish in the '70s.

238
00:14:34,803 --> 00:14:38,439
1961, it was before
you were born.

239
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,208
I was a heartless lout.

240
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,416
I haven't heard
this in years.

241
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:51,252
<i>This was my Mary's
favorite record.</i>

242
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:54,722
This is fantastic.
Did you...

243
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:57,325
bag that yourself?

244
00:14:57,326 --> 00:15:01,195
For 30 years, I shot
everything that moved.

245
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:03,664
Everything from water
buffalo to sacred ibis.

246
00:15:03,665 --> 00:15:05,766
Yeah.

247
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,768
Do you know, young man,

248
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:09,737
its a beautiful paradox
that the closer

249
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:11,772
one moves toward death,

250
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:14,142
the more one sees
the preciousness of life.

251
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:17,378
Last animal I shot
was a leopard.

252
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:20,714
When I saw him
crumpled on the ground,

253
00:15:20,715 --> 00:15:23,951
I felt a great sense
of grief and shame.

254
00:15:23,952 --> 00:15:27,788
I haven't picked up
a rifle since.

255
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:29,990
Don't be sad, Mr. Joe.

256
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:33,861
No. well, just
for a little while, eh?

257
00:15:35,197 --> 00:15:38,132
<i>- ( knocking )
- Molly: Lexie?</i>

258
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:42,903
<i>Are you there? I've got
something that might interest you.</i>

259
00:15:42,904 --> 00:15:45,540
<i>I'll just put it
under the door.</i>

260
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,909
<i>Leave you to it.
Night, night.</i>

261
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:58,786
Full of handy hints
for the perfect wedding.

262
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:01,789
I won't say that I know
you'll be very happy

263
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,926
because nowadays it's said
more in hope than expectation.

264
00:16:05,927 --> 00:16:08,563
But you and Archie
are different.

265
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:10,464
<i>I know that you'll
give each other joy.</i>

266
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:12,933
I'm very happy to have
you as my daughter-in-law.

267
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:16,337
I'd have said the same to
Archie but I can't find him.

268
00:16:16,338 --> 00:16:18,639
What's gonna happen?

269
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,808
It'll blow over.
Usually does.

270
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:23,911
Hector'll come home happy with
a satchel full of dead fish

271
00:16:23,912 --> 00:16:26,514
and bless your union.
Oh, Lexie.

272
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:28,849
By the way,
there's a lovely pattern

273
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,618
for a going-away dress,
page 83.

274
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:40,828
Father, I want
a word with you.

275
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:42,896
Must you?

276
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:45,566
I want an explanation for
your behavior this morning.

277
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,335
- I'm sorry, I'm tired...
- now.

278
00:16:47,336 --> 00:16:49,503
<i>- And upset.
- you're upset?</i>

279
00:16:49,504 --> 00:16:52,406
How do you think Lexie and I feel?
what Jolyon said was bad enough.

280
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:54,342
You won't be
criticizing him?

281
00:16:54,343 --> 00:16:56,744
You stand in line to inherit
a fortune from that old devil.

282
00:16:56,745 --> 00:16:59,547
I don't give a monkey's about
inheritances from you, from Jolyon,

283
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:02,550
from the queen of sheba. All
I care about now is Lexie.

284
00:17:02,551 --> 00:17:04,685
You made her cry,
do you know that?

285
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:07,722
I am truly sorry for that. But I
had good reasons for what I said.

286
00:17:07,723 --> 00:17:11,191
- Such as?
- I can't answer that.

287
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:14,295
They involve another person
and must remain private.

288
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:16,530
That's not good enough.
Do you hear me?

289
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:18,566
Archie don't shout,
good fellow.

290
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:21,369
Lexie and I are going to be
married, whether you like it or not.

291
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,638
- Do you understand?
- Archi-?

292
00:17:25,206 --> 00:17:26,641
( softly )
Hell-!

293
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:29,410
That was quite
a bombshell we heard today.

294
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:33,281
Terrible. tragic.

295
00:17:33,282 --> 00:17:36,751
- You think so?
- Aye, like Hector says-

296
00:17:36,752 --> 00:17:39,553
- you agree with Hector?
- Aye.

297
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:43,324
That loch had some of the
best fishing in the highlands.

298
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:45,993
I'm talking about
Archie and Lexie.

299
00:17:45,994 --> 00:17:48,929
Oh!

300
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,799
So, what do you think?

301
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,502
<i>You were quite sweet
on Lexie yourself.</i>

302
00:17:54,503 --> 00:17:57,338
<i>- Me?
- aye.</i>

303
00:17:57,339 --> 00:18:00,741
No, you've got the wrong end
of the stick there, Golly.

304
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:04,178
I mean,
she's all right.

305
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:06,814
But I never really
fancied her.

306
00:18:06,815 --> 00:18:10,150
Not physically,
anyway.

307
00:18:10,151 --> 00:18:13,854
You slippery, slimy

308
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:17,024
belly-wriggling worm.

309
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:19,293
Hi, Lexie,
all right?

310
00:18:19,294 --> 00:18:21,762
- Don't smile, son.
- Just dandy, Dunc.

311
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:24,332
All the better for hearing
the pearls of your wisdom.

312
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,635
Oh that,
just my little joke.

313
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:30,504
Lucky for you that
I can take one then, eh?

314
00:18:34,376 --> 00:18:37,211
See, I come down here
to chill out with my mates,

315
00:18:37,212 --> 00:18:40,414
tell them about
my exciting new plans.

316
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:42,950
And what did I get?

317
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:45,820
The second betrayal
of the day.

318
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:49,423
- Listen, Lexie- - I'm not
talking to you just now.

319
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:52,993
I'm dealing with the organ
grinder's monkey here.

320
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:55,563
You and me are finished.

321
00:19:11,012 --> 00:19:13,146
Golly,
this won't do at all.

322
00:19:13,147 --> 00:19:15,249
We stood on that bank
for four hours

323
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,518
without the slightest
intimation of a trout.

324
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,920
<i>- That's what Duncan said.
- I can only conclude</i>

325
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:22,155
- your defenses were breached.
- How do you mean?

326
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:25,158
It's obvious. Poachers have
come in and hoovered up the lot.

327
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:27,961
Don't you think your highly
experienced ghillie would have noticed?

328
00:19:27,962 --> 00:19:29,997
What else
could it be?

329
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:32,332
I wouldn't want you
to take this amiss,

330
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,435
but maybe the fault
is not with the fish...

331
00:19:34,436 --> 00:19:37,104
<i>- but with the fisherman.
- I see.</i>

332
00:19:37,105 --> 00:19:41,208
I know you have a poor
opinion of my prowess.

333
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:44,445
It cuts me deep,

334
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:47,882
but it's only one of many
crosses I have to bear.

335
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:52,453
I only hope
that in the future,

336
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:55,723
<i>you and others will
not judge me so harshly.</i>

337
00:19:55,724 --> 00:19:58,191
I can't come
with you, Hector.

338
00:19:58,192 --> 00:20:00,461
Archie's got me
in a three-line whip.

339
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:03,263
Take this. If there
are fish in that loch,

340
00:20:03,264 --> 00:20:06,534
<i>and I'm damned sure there are,
then you'll catch them with that.</i>

341
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:09,537
As Duncan says,
"it'll be as easy

342
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:12,973
as pulling at a 'grab a granny
night' in a disco in Wyck. "

343
00:20:12,974 --> 00:20:16,143
I'm baffled
by the allusion,

344
00:20:16,144 --> 00:20:18,913
but I thank you,
all the same.

345
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:24,618
Of course, I'm sad
not to be there,

346
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:27,054
but you must do
what's right for you.

347
00:20:27,055 --> 00:20:29,957
So something quiet,

348
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,893
something not too far away...

349
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:34,929
and maybe something
by the sea

350
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,297
so we can hear the waves
breaking on the shore.

351
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:39,633
- Such a romantic!
- And you're not?

352
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:42,135
Not an easy thing when
you're married to Hector.

353
00:20:42,136 --> 00:20:44,204
Didn't even
have a honeymoon.

354
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:47,140
To be fair, he planned one but
then there was a crisis here.

355
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:49,510
Typical.

356
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:51,645
We were going
to have one later,

357
00:20:51,646 --> 00:20:54,815
but it was overtaken by a crisis
of quite a different order.

358
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:58,619
- Oh?
- There!

359
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,588
What do you
think of that?

360
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:02,890
That is fantastic.

361
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:04,758
- Oh, look!
- ( both sigh )

362
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:13,300
We can start
down there.

363
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:17,270
Fine. how'd you get on last
night with the old fella?

364
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:20,207
Don't ask, I've had enough.
I washed my hands of him.

365
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:23,544
You think it's gonna be as
easy as that? He's your father.

366
00:21:23,545 --> 00:21:26,213
Let's get going, shall we?
Have you got everything we need?

367
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:35,556
( sighs )

368
00:21:35,557 --> 00:21:37,090
( yawning )

369
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:42,095
( ducks quacking )

370
00:21:49,538 --> 00:21:51,005
( quacking )

371
00:21:55,343 --> 00:21:57,210
( duck squawks )

372
00:22:11,793 --> 00:22:13,627
Pike!

373
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:17,397
Kilwillie.

374
00:22:19,968 --> 00:22:21,735
Hector, old boy.

375
00:22:21,736 --> 00:22:23,470
( honking )

376
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:32,345
My dear fellow,

377
00:22:32,346 --> 00:22:34,915
I've just heard the news about
the forthcoming nuptials.

378
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,650
My heartiest
congratulations.

379
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:38,786
- Snake in the grass!
- What?

380
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:40,788
I have come across
some slippery,

381
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:43,223
malevolent creatures
in my time, Kilwillie,

382
00:22:43,224 --> 00:22:46,126
but you are the Madagascan puff
adder to top the lot of 'em.

383
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:49,262
I haven't the faintest idea
what you're banging on about.

384
00:22:49,263 --> 00:22:52,833
You couldn't bear it that I had
a better fishing ground than you,

385
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:57,170
so you destroyed it with the
nauseous touch of casual cruelty.

386
00:22:57,171 --> 00:23:00,874
What fishing ground? You're not talking
about the loch of the two waters?

387
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:04,812
You put a pike in there.
A monster ate all my trout.

388
00:23:04,813 --> 00:23:07,881
I did not
do this thing.

389
00:23:07,882 --> 00:23:12,452
I swear to you on Badger's
life. He's big, you say?

390
00:23:12,453 --> 00:23:15,723
Enormous, probably the biggest
pike in the British Isles.

391
00:23:15,724 --> 00:23:18,626
The biggest pike in the
history of, well... pike!

392
00:23:18,627 --> 00:23:20,327
- Really?
- Yes.

393
00:23:20,328 --> 00:23:22,329
Well, well.

394
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,665
Yes, well...

395
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:28,102
I've got an important
appointment.

396
00:23:28,103 --> 00:23:30,270
- Me too.
- Perhaps another time.

397
00:23:30,271 --> 00:23:33,206
<i>- Yes... yes.
- ( car engine starting )</i>

398
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:58,532
<i>Duncan: Lexie!</i>

399
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:01,902
- Duncan?!
- Open the window!

400
00:24:04,505 --> 00:24:06,606
What are you playing at?

401
00:24:06,607 --> 00:24:08,608
About last night,

402
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:11,545
I knew if I
tackled you downstairs

403
00:24:11,546 --> 00:24:13,681
you wouldn't talk to me.

404
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:16,016
This way,
you can't avoid it.

405
00:24:16,017 --> 00:24:19,186
You can't have my death
on your conscience, can you?

406
00:24:19,187 --> 00:24:22,022
Come away in,
you bampot.

407
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:24,457
About what I said
last night,

408
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:27,161
I never meant it.

409
00:24:27,162 --> 00:24:29,730
I've always fancied you.

410
00:24:29,731 --> 00:24:32,599
You're the most
beautiful, funniest,

411
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,235
most specialest girl
I've ever known.

412
00:24:35,236 --> 00:24:37,304
Duncan...

413
00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:39,639
I know you're fond of me

414
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,176
but I'm glad it's Archie.

415
00:24:42,177 --> 00:24:46,113
But if he doesn't
cherish you like you deserve,

416
00:24:46,114 --> 00:24:50,751
I'll stick him in butter
and fry him like a fish supper.

417
00:24:50,752 --> 00:24:52,319
Aahh!

418
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,189
Duncan! It's fine, I've got you.

419
00:24:59,027 --> 00:25:01,361
Are you okay?

420
00:25:03,364 --> 00:25:05,498
This is the closest
we've ever been.

421
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:09,402
Come here, you
crispy cod fella.

422
00:25:15,376 --> 00:25:17,778
- Oh Hector!
- Push off, you're trespassing.

423
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:19,312
Come on, I'm only
here to help.

424
00:25:19,313 --> 00:25:21,314
I don't need any help,
thank you very much.

425
00:25:21,315 --> 00:25:23,617
I've got the right rod,
look at that.

426
00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:27,921
That isn't a rod. This
is a rod. ( laughs )

427
00:25:27,922 --> 00:25:30,157
I won't tell you
again, Kilwillie.

428
00:25:30,158 --> 00:25:32,159
Get off my land.

429
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,128
It's only a bit
of fun.

430
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:37,164
Quite the opposite.
This is deadly serious.

431
00:25:37,165 --> 00:25:39,566
I want this beast. By
jingo, I'm going to get him.

432
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,601
Oh, oh, aah!

433
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:47,141
Oh-!

434
00:25:49,978 --> 00:25:51,645
My dear chap!

435
00:25:54,983 --> 00:25:58,318
Are you all right,
my dear old fellow?

436
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:00,720
Did you witness
that unprovoked aggression?

437
00:26:00,721 --> 00:26:04,258
The enemy just sent his tanks
trundling over the Polish border.

438
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:06,260
I'm going
to need an ally.

439
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:11,464
Maybe you could
be the page boy?

440
00:26:11,465 --> 00:26:13,133
( both snicker )

441
00:26:16,604 --> 00:26:19,039
- What's up, Mr. Joe?
- It's no use.

442
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,975
Neither am I.

443
00:26:21,976 --> 00:26:24,144
Here, let me
give you a hand.

444
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:26,146
You need some food
inside you.

445
00:26:26,147 --> 00:26:30,383
I'm not hungry.
I'm going to the pub.

446
00:26:30,384 --> 00:26:34,421
Only I can't,
'cause I'm barred.

447
00:26:34,422 --> 00:26:35,923
<i>( chuckles )</i>

448
00:26:35,924 --> 00:26:37,657
Hello, princess.

449
00:26:37,658 --> 00:26:40,560
- I'm not talking to you.
- Take no notice of me.

450
00:26:40,561 --> 00:26:44,664
Who am I to pontificate
about anyone,

451
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:46,166
the mess I'm in?

452
00:26:47,368 --> 00:26:49,870
Sit down. let me
take a look at you.

453
00:26:49,871 --> 00:26:52,505
It's nothing,
just a measly scratch.

454
00:26:52,506 --> 00:26:55,675
<i>Sit down before
I give you a real bad turn.</i>

455
00:26:56,878 --> 00:26:58,611
Now, who did
this to you?

456
00:26:58,612 --> 00:27:01,448
A large man,
in a loud checked shirt

457
00:27:01,449 --> 00:27:03,583
of indifferent quality.

458
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:07,354
Beast McLauren
- he's terrible when he's got a drink in him.

459
00:27:07,355 --> 00:27:10,257
Why are you picking
a fight with him?

460
00:27:10,258 --> 00:27:12,492
He impugned the name
of a lady.

461
00:27:12,493 --> 00:27:15,528
Called her a stupid, old-
I can't even say it.

462
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:19,066
Someone very dear
to me once.

463
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:21,401
Must be a day
for love, eh?

464
00:27:21,402 --> 00:27:23,337
<i>What was her name?</i>

465
00:27:23,338 --> 00:27:26,740
Mary Mclntyre.

466
00:27:26,741 --> 00:27:28,976
I've lost her now.

467
00:27:28,977 --> 00:27:31,311
( whispers )
Mary Mclntyre...?

468
00:27:31,312 --> 00:27:34,348
Maybe not for too long. Duncan,
go and get the phone book.

469
00:27:36,384 --> 00:27:37,584
Ow!

470
00:27:40,221 --> 00:27:42,455
I've looked up
the British record for pike.

471
00:27:42,456 --> 00:27:45,592
The biggest one 54 pounds
- a mere tiddling compared to ours.

472
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:47,627
I suppose we're sure
it really is a fish.

473
00:27:47,628 --> 00:27:51,265
What do you think pulled me into the
water, a missing soviet submarine?

474
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:53,400
Come on,
any bright ideas?

475
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:56,736
I'm directing every particle
of brainpower at the problem.

476
00:27:56,737 --> 00:27:58,738
Mmm. very reassuring.

477
00:27:58,739 --> 00:28:01,875
How do you catch
a pike this big?

478
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:03,911
It's too much for my
giant iron snap tackle.

479
00:28:03,912 --> 00:28:06,947
- Hmph.
- What is all this stuff?

480
00:28:06,948 --> 00:28:09,883
It's Jolyon's rubbish
he brought back from Africa.

481
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:13,853
- Oh.
- Good lord.

482
00:28:13,854 --> 00:28:15,688
I say,
very smart.

483
00:28:18,293 --> 00:28:20,593
Yes, careful.

484
00:28:20,594 --> 00:28:22,762
Well done!
Double top!

485
00:28:22,763 --> 00:28:25,799
Ah!

486
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,135
Ah...!

487
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:30,737
Everything all right,
Monsieur Cousteau?

488
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,075
If I see any suspicious-looking
fins, I'll go like this-

489
00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:36,977
� dum-dum, dum-dum
dum-dum... �

490
00:28:39,047 --> 00:28:41,681
<i>oh, Useless, Useless!</i>

491
00:28:41,682 --> 00:28:43,483
( barking )

492
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:15,382
Useless!

493
00:29:18,386 --> 00:29:21,588
Archie? Archie?

494
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:24,024
Come on, son,
it's getting late.

495
00:29:24,025 --> 00:29:25,758
We'll try again
tomorrow.

496
00:29:35,736 --> 00:29:38,438
Description in the family
history might be a bit hazy

497
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:40,407
but the geological
survey wasn't.

498
00:29:40,408 --> 00:29:43,410
- Right here, it said.
- We'll find it, don't worry.

499
00:29:48,282 --> 00:29:50,984
- Here.
- Thanks.

500
00:29:53,054 --> 00:29:55,522
Why is it-
why has it always been

501
00:29:55,523 --> 00:29:58,158
that I can rely on you
more than my father?

502
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,261
<i>- Come on, son.
- it's true.</i>

503
00:30:01,262 --> 00:30:03,630
Whenever I've
needed him most-

504
00:30:03,631 --> 00:30:06,400
school sports day,
or after Jamie died,

505
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:09,702
or now to bless my marriage- the
most important decision in my life-

506
00:30:09,703 --> 00:30:12,205
he somehow manages
to disappear.

507
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:14,408
Where is he?
What's he doing?

508
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:16,609
What could be more important
than me and Lexie?

509
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,778
And why does he think
we'd such be a disaster?

510
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:20,680
I'm sure he doesn't
think that.

511
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:22,782
- Okay, then why-
- look Archie,

512
00:30:22,783 --> 00:30:26,119
I can't explain
your father,

513
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,688
what drives him,
what makes him tick.

514
00:30:28,689 --> 00:30:32,392
He is what he is.
But this I do know-

515
00:30:32,393 --> 00:30:34,727
he's a very proud father.

516
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:40,033
That's just it,
isn't it?

517
00:30:40,034 --> 00:30:41,834
Someone else
has to tell me that.

518
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:45,338
I have to hear from you
that my father's proud of me.

519
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:48,542
It's no good, is it?

520
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:52,412
Something has
to be faced here.

521
00:31:02,123 --> 00:31:04,958
- Lexie: I hope all works out.
- I won't forget this.

522
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:07,627
You've been kinder to me
than I have a right to expect.

523
00:31:07,628 --> 00:31:10,964
You have fine spirit,
and a better heart.

524
00:31:37,158 --> 00:31:39,092
Mary?

525
00:31:41,795 --> 00:31:43,763
Mary?

526
00:31:46,234 --> 00:31:49,068
Is it you?
Is it really you?

527
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:52,805
<i>- you look well.
- Thank you.</i>

528
00:31:52,806 --> 00:31:55,875
I brought you a present.
It's our song.

529
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:58,311
I can't tell you
what it means to me

530
00:31:58,312 --> 00:32:00,614
<i>to see you after
all these years.</i>

531
00:32:00,615 --> 00:32:02,315
I was such a fool.

532
00:32:02,316 --> 00:32:04,484
I never forgot you.

533
00:32:04,485 --> 00:32:07,086
I never married.
You were the only one.

534
00:32:07,087 --> 00:32:11,658
No one could match
your loveliness and smile.

535
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:15,328
I always knew you'd
come back one day.

536
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:18,097
I'm here.

537
00:32:18,098 --> 00:32:20,933
Perhaps our story
can have a happy ending.

538
00:32:20,934 --> 00:32:24,271
I said to all my friends,
one of these days,

539
00:32:24,272 --> 00:32:27,940
he's going to come
for me- my Frank!

540
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:31,144
Perhaps, you and I,
we-

541
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,113
Frank?

542
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:36,015
Sing for me,
Mr. Sinatra.

543
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,727
Aha!

544
00:32:47,728 --> 00:32:51,164
First the troublemaker,
now the fugitive.

545
00:32:51,165 --> 00:32:53,166
I've had a call about you.

546
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:57,103
Something about
a dodgy credit card.

547
00:32:57,104 --> 00:32:59,606
Bank of Kenya, was it?

548
00:33:03,344 --> 00:33:05,612
I'll call round later
for a wee chat.

549
00:33:09,517 --> 00:33:13,052
A pike is the freshwater
equivalent of the great white shark-

550
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:15,154
a killing machine.

551
00:33:15,155 --> 00:33:19,392
Lifeless eyes, black eyes
like a doll's,

552
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:22,462
a wide mouth
and big teeth.

553
00:33:22,463 --> 00:33:25,498
<i>All it ever thinks about
is how to use them.</i>

554
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:28,201
<i>You put that in the loch</i>

555
00:33:28,202 --> 00:33:31,003
<i>and it will clean the water
of all swimming things-</i>

556
00:33:31,004 --> 00:33:32,205
<i>perch, trout, eels,</i>

557
00:33:32,206 --> 00:33:34,441
ducks, birds.

558
00:33:34,442 --> 00:33:37,744
I once heard of someone caught
a pike, slit open its stomach

559
00:33:37,745 --> 00:33:41,047
and found a kind
of dog foot inside.

560
00:33:41,048 --> 00:33:43,650
How disgusting.

561
00:33:43,651 --> 00:33:46,819
You rid us of that beast,
you'll be doing us all a service.

562
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,988
If indeed
it really is there.

563
00:33:48,989 --> 00:33:50,990
It's there, believe me.
It's there.

564
00:33:50,991 --> 00:33:53,326
Maybe.

565
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:56,996
Anyway, good luck
and try this bait.

566
00:33:56,997 --> 00:34:00,066
<i>Sometimes I think
it'd be easier</i>

567
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:02,235
to just blow a pike
out of the water

568
00:34:02,236 --> 00:34:05,037
rather than try and catch it
with a rod and line.

569
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:07,574
Beddy-byes, Kilwillie.
Big day tomorrow.

570
00:34:07,575 --> 00:34:10,143
Right you are.
Goodbye, Golly.

571
00:34:10,144 --> 00:34:12,011
Kilwillie.

572
00:34:12,012 --> 00:34:13,613
What's all this?

573
00:34:13,614 --> 00:34:15,615
That's stuff
for Archie's thing.

574
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:17,717
Careful, that's
plastic explosive.

575
00:34:17,718 --> 00:34:19,952
Good heavens,
he's a boy, isn't he?

576
00:34:19,953 --> 00:34:21,621
Yes, he is.

577
00:34:21,622 --> 00:34:24,023
Maybe one day you'll get
around to telling him that.

578
00:34:27,662 --> 00:34:29,329
Good man, Golly.

579
00:34:41,074 --> 00:34:45,211
You wanted to see me?

580
00:34:45,212 --> 00:34:48,948
<i>I'm not sure want
is quite the right word.</i>

581
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:51,451
<i>Need would be
nearer the mark.</i>

582
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:53,353
But as ever between
you and me,

583
00:34:53,354 --> 00:34:56,055
this is something that I have to
do and there is no pleasure in it.

584
00:34:56,056 --> 00:34:58,491
You seem rather angry.

585
00:34:58,492 --> 00:35:00,327
Again, not quite
the right word.

586
00:35:00,328 --> 00:35:02,228
I'm actually
rather weary.

587
00:35:02,229 --> 00:35:04,831
I'm the old man. I'm the
one who should be weary.

588
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:08,601
Could you stop talking in
riddles and get to the point?

589
00:35:08,602 --> 00:35:10,704
All right.

590
00:35:13,273 --> 00:35:16,343
When I gathered you all
together yesterday

591
00:35:16,344 --> 00:35:18,545
to tell you about
the love of my life,

592
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:21,348
<i>I somehow knew what
would happen.</i>

593
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:25,218
<i>I knew ultimately
everyone else would be</i>

594
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:27,053
thrilled for me
and Lexie.

595
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:29,222
But I also knew

596
00:35:29,223 --> 00:35:31,924
that, for whatever reason,
you wouldn't.

597
00:35:31,925 --> 00:35:34,961
<i>- Can I just say- - that is
exactly how it turned out.</i>

598
00:35:34,962 --> 00:35:38,565
<i>Because that's the way
it's always been.</i>

599
00:35:38,566 --> 00:35:40,967
With me looking
for your endorsement

600
00:35:40,968 --> 00:35:42,935
and approval and never
quite getting it.

601
00:35:42,936 --> 00:35:44,604
Does it really matter
what I think?

602
00:35:44,605 --> 00:35:46,773
Did it matter to you what
your father thought of you?

603
00:35:46,774 --> 00:35:48,975
I suppose it did.

604
00:35:48,976 --> 00:35:51,911
Just for the record, I was
a grave disappointment to him.

605
00:35:51,912 --> 00:35:54,947
Well, like all fathers and sons
we're stuck with each other.

606
00:35:54,948 --> 00:35:57,650
<i>Perhaps I'll always
be a problem to you.</i>

607
00:35:57,651 --> 00:36:00,152
But what I came here
to say was that

608
00:36:00,153 --> 00:36:02,689
I'm just not gonna
worry about it anymore.

609
00:36:04,057 --> 00:36:06,125
<i>I'm going to leave
that up to you.</i>

610
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:08,928
I'm 31 years old.
I'm about to get married.

611
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:11,197
And for better or worse,
I am my own man.

612
00:36:11,198 --> 00:36:13,966
<i>It's time to move on.</i>

613
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:15,968
Good night, father.

614
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,079
Arch!

615
00:36:29,717 --> 00:36:31,718
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, look.

616
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:34,921
I found the perfect place
to get married- in Orkney.

617
00:36:34,922 --> 00:36:38,525
There's a stone circle
that's 4,000 years old

618
00:36:38,526 --> 00:36:40,927
and overlooks the beach
and the Atlantic shore.

619
00:36:40,928 --> 00:36:42,929
What's wrong?

620
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,964
Well, I've been
thinking.

621
00:36:44,965 --> 00:36:47,133
Arch, I wish
you wouldn't do that.

622
00:36:47,134 --> 00:36:50,202
Maybe you were right. Why should
we get married somewhere else

623
00:36:50,203 --> 00:36:51,738
just because he
disapproves?

624
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:54,373
This is where we live. This
is where our friends are.

625
00:36:56,944 --> 00:36:58,711
I'm sorry, but surely
you can see-

626
00:36:58,712 --> 00:37:00,880
no- what I see

627
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:03,382
is that you have pushed me
into all of this.

628
00:37:03,383 --> 00:37:05,685
Me and Molly have done
all this groundwork.

629
00:37:05,686 --> 00:37:10,423
And I got all excited and you want
to push me into something else.

630
00:37:10,424 --> 00:37:12,625
Archie, why do you
want to get married?

631
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:16,429
Is it because you love me,
or you want to spite your dad?

632
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,231
<i>Or is it that now you don't
want to marry me at all?</i>

633
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:23,837
I'm so sorry,
I was just passing.

634
00:37:27,942 --> 00:37:30,577
Can I just say...

635
00:37:30,578 --> 00:37:32,745
don't make
the mistake I made.

636
00:37:32,746 --> 00:37:35,014
I fell in love
with a girl and I ran away

637
00:37:35,015 --> 00:37:37,851
because people said
she wasn't good enough for me.

638
00:37:37,852 --> 00:37:40,553
<i>I've been lonely
my entire life.</i>

639
00:37:40,554 --> 00:37:44,090
So don't worry about what
other people say, children.

640
00:37:44,091 --> 00:37:47,494
You just- hang on
to each other.

641
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,334
Arch, what are
we gonna do?

642
00:38:01,642 --> 00:38:05,211
<i>Golly: "sometimes I think it would be
easier to blow a pike out of the water.</i>

643
00:38:05,212 --> 00:38:08,114
<i>Rather than try and catch
it with a rod and a line. "</i>

644
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:41,113
Very well,
I'll come quietly.

645
00:38:44,852 --> 00:38:48,254
You went to visit
my mother.

646
00:38:48,255 --> 00:38:51,624
Mary?
You're Mary's son?

647
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:54,326
You told the folk
at the home

648
00:38:54,327 --> 00:38:55,962
you were once her
special friend.

649
00:38:55,963 --> 00:38:57,564
When?

650
00:38:57,565 --> 00:39:01,801
Summer 1961.

651
00:39:01,802 --> 00:39:06,005
I was born in
the spring of 1962.

652
00:39:06,006 --> 00:39:08,875
I never had
a father.

653
00:39:11,545 --> 00:39:13,179
Till now...

654
00:39:15,082 --> 00:39:17,349
dad.

655
00:39:21,121 --> 00:39:23,289
( sniffs )

656
00:39:27,828 --> 00:39:31,230
- Hector...?
- Ahh!

657
00:39:31,231 --> 00:39:33,299
- What are you doing?
- Looking for this.

658
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,735
It belonged to the boys,
do you remember?

659
00:39:35,736 --> 00:39:38,004
- What are you going to do with it?
- You'll see.

660
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:39,939
I haven't finished
with you yet.

661
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,475
This business
with Archie and Lexie,

662
00:39:42,476 --> 00:39:44,844
you've upset them both
very much, you know.

663
00:39:44,845 --> 00:39:47,413
I tried telling Archie it
was nothing to do with them,

664
00:39:47,414 --> 00:39:49,682
that is was related
to someone else.

665
00:39:49,683 --> 00:39:51,383
Who, for heaven's sakes?

666
00:39:51,384 --> 00:39:54,654
You're not making much
sense to me or anyone else.

667
00:39:54,655 --> 00:39:56,489
You'd better
sit down.

668
00:39:58,592 --> 00:40:01,628
You see,
it's just that-

669
00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:05,064
the thing is-
it's about you-

670
00:40:05,065 --> 00:40:07,333
<i>- as it always has been.
- Me?</i>

671
00:40:07,334 --> 00:40:09,769
And me- us,
our marriage.

672
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:13,572
What about our marriage?

673
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:15,407
Molly,
when I first met you,

674
00:40:15,408 --> 00:40:18,745
you were the loveliest creature
I had ever seen. You still are.

675
00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:21,080
<i>But you weren't just glamorous,
you were successful, too.</i>

676
00:40:21,081 --> 00:40:22,982
I was a model,
that's all.

677
00:40:22,983 --> 00:40:26,218
No, that's not right. That Italian
chap wanted you to be in his film.

678
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:29,722
- What was it called,
"Blow Off"? - "Blow-Up. "

679
00:40:29,723 --> 00:40:32,424
Mr. Antonioni.
"Blow-up. "

680
00:40:32,425 --> 00:40:35,294
That's right.
But you married me instead.

681
00:40:35,295 --> 00:40:37,764
I brought you here
in the middle of nowhere.

682
00:40:37,765 --> 00:40:40,332
<i>Shut you up in this gloomy, old
house, like Rapunzel in her tower.</i>

683
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:43,069
And no one saw
your beauty but me.

684
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:47,506
A hopeless character,
not worthy of you at all.

685
00:40:47,507 --> 00:40:50,342
<i>And then,
you ran away.</i>

686
00:40:50,343 --> 00:40:52,712
This was a very
long time ago.

687
00:40:52,713 --> 00:40:54,213
We haven't spoken
of it for years.

688
00:40:54,214 --> 00:40:57,650
That hasn't stopped me
thinking about it. wondering.

689
00:40:57,651 --> 00:41:01,420
Wondering about what?
I came back, didn't I?

690
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:04,090
You were pregnant with Jamie.
Perhaps you came back because of that.

691
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:06,926
A sense of duty,
not because of-

692
00:41:06,927 --> 00:41:09,628
what has this got to do
with Archie and Lexie?

693
00:41:09,629 --> 00:41:12,398
I hate the thought of the dear
girl being imprisoned like you.

694
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:15,134
Maybe she'll run off too,
but not come back.

695
00:41:15,135 --> 00:41:17,203
Hector, listen to me.

696
00:41:17,204 --> 00:41:20,472
When I ran off
I was young and foolish

697
00:41:20,473 --> 00:41:22,809
and soon realized
what a mistake I had made.

698
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:26,145
Since then I have
never looked back.

699
00:41:26,146 --> 00:41:31,184
There have been dark
moments in our life together,

700
00:41:31,185 --> 00:41:34,520
but nothing to all the others
that shine in my memory.

701
00:41:34,521 --> 00:41:37,256
I'm content,
with my husband

702
00:41:37,257 --> 00:41:39,792
and my marriage
and my life.

703
00:41:39,793 --> 00:41:42,128
No, more than that-

704
00:41:42,129 --> 00:41:45,798
deeply content.

705
00:41:45,799 --> 00:41:48,400
Are you, really?

706
00:41:48,401 --> 00:41:51,003
Of course.

707
00:41:51,004 --> 00:41:54,240
Now you must go and explain
everything to Archie.

708
00:41:54,241 --> 00:41:56,342
I'll speak to them both
this evening.

709
00:41:56,343 --> 00:41:59,045
Hector, Joe is
coming to see me.

710
00:41:59,046 --> 00:42:02,581
I love him dearly
but oh, oh,

711
00:42:02,582 --> 00:42:04,751
he's not an easy
house guest, is he?

712
00:42:04,752 --> 00:42:06,886
He does rather breathe
my oxygen, old girl.

713
00:42:06,887 --> 00:42:09,155
But if you want him to stay-
what are you painting?

714
00:42:09,156 --> 00:42:11,824
You, but you can't see
it yet. It's not finished.

715
00:42:11,825 --> 00:42:13,860
Would you
sit for me, Hector?

716
00:42:13,861 --> 00:42:15,962
<i>- can't darling, going fishing.
- Oh, must you?</i>

717
00:42:15,963 --> 00:42:18,631
I fear so.
You see, Molly,

718
00:42:18,632 --> 00:42:21,801
I learned long ago that chaps
like me don't exactly make history.

719
00:42:21,802 --> 00:42:24,003
<i>We don't even influence
world events.</i>

720
00:42:24,004 --> 00:42:27,273
Once upon a time we did,
but not anymore.

721
00:42:27,274 --> 00:42:30,276
All that's left
are small battles,

722
00:42:30,277 --> 00:42:33,679
and even smaller victories-
like catching pike.

723
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:38,450
I love you
more than my life.

724
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:40,953
I'll see you later.

725
00:42:55,502 --> 00:42:59,071
Don't worry, dear girl.
All will be well.

726
00:43:09,016 --> 00:43:12,819
I feel like a boy
from the lower remove

727
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,854
summoned to see
the beak.

728
00:43:14,855 --> 00:43:18,624
Come and sit, Joe.

729
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:20,426
Here by me.

730
00:43:22,963 --> 00:43:26,232
It's been lovely
having you here.

731
00:43:26,233 --> 00:43:28,701
- But-
- you want me to go?

732
00:43:28,702 --> 00:43:30,736
No, no,

733
00:43:30,737 --> 00:43:33,272
but your visit has
created certain waves.

734
00:43:33,273 --> 00:43:35,674
And I was wondering

735
00:43:35,675 --> 00:43:37,810
when you were
planning to return home?

736
00:43:37,811 --> 00:43:40,179
Well, I can't.

737
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,114
I haven't a got a home.

738
00:43:42,115 --> 00:43:44,450
I was kicked out
by the new owner.

739
00:43:44,451 --> 00:43:45,918
Nouveau Kenyan.

740
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:48,054
He's an importer
of refrigerators.

741
00:43:48,055 --> 00:43:51,090
There's a lot of money
in fridges in the tropics.

742
00:43:51,091 --> 00:43:52,959
What about your money?

743
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,963
All your lands,
your tea plantations?

744
00:43:56,964 --> 00:43:59,465
I made a foolish,
impetuous

745
00:43:59,466 --> 00:44:02,101
and thoroughly
characteristic decision

746
00:44:02,102 --> 00:44:04,237
to grow coffee on them.

747
00:44:04,238 --> 00:44:08,140
Then I spent five years watching the
price drop as low as my self-esteem.

748
00:44:08,141 --> 00:44:10,376
<i>I lost everything
except you and Archie</i>

749
00:44:10,377 --> 00:44:15,248
and a sentimental police
constable called Callum.

750
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:21,854
So what are you
going to do now?

751
00:44:21,855 --> 00:44:24,290
I suppose I'm throwing
myself on your mercy.

752
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,195
Good people, and I could be happy here,

753
00:44:29,196 --> 00:44:31,764
do the odd thing,

754
00:44:31,765 --> 00:44:34,367
give young Archie
wise counsel and advice.

755
00:44:34,368 --> 00:44:36,835
Joe, dear Joe.

756
00:44:36,836 --> 00:44:39,772
That would be fine.

757
00:44:39,773 --> 00:44:43,142
But don't you see,
that is Hector's job?

758
00:44:52,752 --> 00:44:53,685
Golly!

759
00:44:55,355 --> 00:44:56,822
Golly!

760
00:45:00,928 --> 00:45:03,429
- Are you mad?
- Oh, don't fuss.

761
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:05,431
Plastic explosives?

762
00:45:05,432 --> 00:45:08,901
- Have you totally taken leave of your senses?
- I've read the instructions.

763
00:45:08,902 --> 00:45:11,237
I wash my hands of this.
I don't want any part of it.

764
00:45:11,238 --> 00:45:13,572
Kilwillie, are we to
be defeated by a fish?

765
00:45:13,573 --> 00:45:16,642
If this incendiary folly is the only alternative
- then, yes.

766
00:45:16,643 --> 00:45:18,744
You show
your true colors.

767
00:45:18,745 --> 00:45:21,647
No spirit, no stomach
for the struggles of life.

768
00:45:21,648 --> 00:45:24,951
Sometimes, Hector,
you really are too much.

769
00:45:28,155 --> 00:45:30,756
Right, Useless,
fetch the boat.

770
00:45:32,592 --> 00:45:34,893
Fetch the-
fetch-

771
00:45:34,894 --> 00:45:36,262
oh, I'll do it.

772
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:48,240
Where have you been?

773
00:45:48,241 --> 00:45:50,809
What's that?

774
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,811
I was reading...

775
00:45:52,812 --> 00:45:55,114
one of the family histories
the other day.

776
00:45:55,115 --> 00:45:58,817
I came across this reference
to my great-grandfather,

777
00:45:58,818 --> 00:46:01,454
who found some small
quantities up in the river

778
00:46:01,455 --> 00:46:04,357
right about the time they came
across some larger deposits

779
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:07,226
<i>up in Sutherland.
So we went looking</i>

780
00:46:07,227 --> 00:46:10,129
and we found this.

781
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:11,763
But what is it?

782
00:46:11,764 --> 00:46:16,435
It should just about
be enough for a couple of rings.

783
00:46:16,436 --> 00:46:18,471
Gold?

784
00:46:20,673 --> 00:46:22,441
You found gold?

785
00:46:22,442 --> 00:46:26,145
Lex, I want to be
with you forever.

786
00:46:27,881 --> 00:46:30,116
I love you more
than my life.

787
00:46:30,117 --> 00:46:32,251
Arch.

788
00:46:34,087 --> 00:46:36,688
H.M.S. Glenbogle,
do your worst.

789
00:46:36,689 --> 00:46:38,790
( laughs heartily )

790
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:08,220
<i>Useless?</i>

791
00:47:08,221 --> 00:47:09,788
Useless?

792
00:47:16,796 --> 00:47:18,764
Ah...

793
00:47:19,832 --> 00:47:21,400
<i>( explosion )</i>

794
00:47:50,663 --> 00:47:53,765
Archie, son-

795
00:47:53,766 --> 00:47:56,435
your dad.
It's your dad, Archie.

796
00:47:56,436 --> 00:47:58,437
What's the old
fool done now?

797
00:48:05,178 --> 00:48:07,746
<i>Kilwillie:
Molly! Molly!</i>

798
00:48:07,747 --> 00:48:10,449
Kilwillie?
What do you want?

799
00:48:23,263 --> 00:48:26,465
