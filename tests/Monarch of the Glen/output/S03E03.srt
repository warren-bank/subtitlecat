Hi.

5
00:00:25,554 --> 00:00:29,056
Uh-huh. I hope there's
no film in that thing.

6
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:30,991
Nah. it's digital.

7
00:00:32,928 --> 00:00:34,562
What do you want?

8
00:00:34,563 --> 00:00:36,664
<i>You didn't come
all the way up here</i>

9
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:38,900
this early just
to take some snaps.

10
00:00:40,302 --> 00:00:42,670
This friend of mine
from London phoned.

11
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:45,907
He wants to bring up a fishing
party for the weekend. 12 rods.

12
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:47,642
12? And what are you going to catch?

13
00:00:47,643 --> 00:00:49,444
You know this river
is fished out.

14
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:52,346
I'm sorry, Archie, you're
going to have to tell him no.

15
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:54,816
I'll be saying no
to ï¿½20,000.

16
00:00:56,452 --> 00:00:59,153
I have to think in the
long term. That's my job.

17
00:00:59,154 --> 00:01:02,723
<i>- Yeah, I know.
- 12 is far too many.</i>

18
00:01:02,724 --> 00:01:05,359
A couple of them
maybe.

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,495
It's not worth it
for the estate.

20
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:09,196
How about nine?

21
00:01:10,398 --> 00:01:12,867
- I can live with six.
- Done.

22
00:01:14,636 --> 00:01:15,870
Oh, one last thing.

23
00:01:17,138 --> 00:01:20,140
<i>- Smile.

25
00:02:55,704 --> 00:02:59,006
- Got your paper.
- You needn't do that.

26
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:00,708
No bother.

27
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,743
Thank you.

28
00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:04,344
What are you
up to today?

29
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:06,681
Going to work. What are you up to today?

30
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:08,883
Visiting
my Auntie Liz,

31
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:10,885
seeing as I'm here.

32
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:13,054
Oh,
lucky Auntie Liz.

33
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,765
Whose cup is this?

34
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:27,868
- Herself from the office.
- Oh, dear.

35
00:03:27,869 --> 00:03:30,605
I see troubled times ahead
for Stella.

36
00:03:30,606 --> 00:03:33,975
Oh, shame! here.
What does mine say?

37
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,478
- Oh, Lexie.
- What?

38
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:40,081
This is much more exciting-
I see romance.

39
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:42,917
Love is just about
to walk into your life.

40
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:48,222
<i>- any sign of the post?
- ( laughing )</i>

41
00:03:48,223 --> 00:03:50,224
What?

42
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:52,893
Your timing is
just way too good.

43
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:10,645
I have your breakfast
all ready for you.

44
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:12,046
I haven't
got time.

45
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:14,949
Lassie, you'll fade away.
Will you sit down and eat?

46
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,417
- I'll take some fruit.
- Fruit!

47
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:20,021
Duncan had a wee hamster,
ate more than you do,

48
00:04:20,022 --> 00:04:22,523
- will you sit down?
- You're as bad as my mom.

49
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:25,860
- Somebody's got to look after you.
- I really do have to go.

50
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:28,629
I'll fry up a nice bit of
freshly cut salmon for your tea.

51
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,198
Fish fingers will be fine.
You don't have to buy salmon.

52
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,534
You're right there.
Sometimes the wee fishes

53
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:36,837
- just swim up the street and into my fridge.
- ( clears throat )

54
00:04:36,838 --> 00:04:38,272
What?

55
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:42,677
That sounds fine.
I'll see you later.

56
00:04:42,678 --> 00:04:45,012
- I'll come with you.
- I know the way.

57
00:04:45,013 --> 00:04:47,481
Hold on. I have a wee job for you.

58
00:04:49,017 --> 00:04:51,819
<i>Archie: This is the cover

00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:56,456

finest salmon rivers

61
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:59,060

65
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,971
Great.

66
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:13,841
- But?
- No, it's excellent.

67
00:05:13,842 --> 00:05:16,711
Good. nice to know
I'm not entirely useless.

68
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:19,980
Sorry.

69
00:05:22,383 --> 00:05:24,885
Duncan, you're supposed
to be working.

70
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:27,387
While you're here,
can I check something?

71
00:05:27,388 --> 00:05:30,557
Is there much poaching on
the estate? Salmon, I mean.

72
00:05:30,558 --> 00:05:33,360
I don't think so. Golly
keeps it under control.

73
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:36,997
But there's over seven miles of
river. What is he, superghillie?

74
00:05:36,998 --> 00:05:38,833
No. a small place
like this,

75
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:42,569
if somebody was poaching,
Golly would know all about it.

76
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,005
- Is there a problem?
- Obviously not.

77
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:55,783
Hey! It's love's young dreamer.

78
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:58,552
- Have you asked her out yet, Romeo?
- No.

79
00:05:58,553 --> 00:06:02,223
- Playing hard to get?
- I saw her with Archie-

80
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:03,690
in the office.

81
00:06:05,026 --> 00:06:08,229
Get away. In the
office? Where they work?

82
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:11,698
He was all over her.

83
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,201
Yeah, because they
got on so well.

84
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,104
You think
I'm being stupid.

85
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:19,907
But just look at the sort of
women that Archie falls for.

86
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:23,244
- Justine, Katrina-
- so Einstein figures

87
00:06:23,245 --> 00:06:25,780
that because Stella is
brainy and skinny and-

88
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:29,250
gorgeous, funny,
sophisticated-

89
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:32,286
no way! Archie would
never be so stupid.

90
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:35,122
Would he?

91
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:38,625
Oh!

92
00:06:41,863 --> 00:06:43,964
Yeah, this one
should do.

93
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:45,800
I think
this bed's okay.

94
00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:49,069
Only one way
to find out.

95
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,071
Archie, can I
have a word?

96
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:52,739
In private,
please.

97
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,515
This letter, booking the
weekend, that says a party of 12?

98
00:07:01,516 --> 00:07:04,584
I spoke to Golly and he said
he can only take six rods.

99
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:06,954
We can't afford to turn
that sort of business away.

100
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:09,323
I phoned your friend
and told him we'll take all 12.

101
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:11,425
Now do you want to tell
Golly or shall I?

102
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:15,095
If Golly says we can only take
six rods, I respect his opinion-

103
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:17,497
this is about generating
income for the estate,

104
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:19,266
that means it's my decision.

105
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:21,368
- You don't understand.
- Yes, I do.

106
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:24,604
Better than you it would appear.
I'll deal with this.

107
00:07:39,387 --> 00:07:41,956
I thought there was
a shortage of fish.

108
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:44,191
That's why
I'm tagging them.

109
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:46,560
Do you throw back
everything that you catch?

110
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:48,395
<i>Sounds like a waste of time to me.</i>

111
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:51,098
It would if you don't know
the first thing about fishing.

112
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:53,067
Is there something
you wanted?

113
00:07:53,068 --> 00:07:56,103
Yes. This fishing weekend
that Archie's set up-

114
00:07:56,104 --> 00:07:58,072
there'll be
12 people coming.

115
00:07:58,073 --> 00:08:01,108
No... Archie and I talked.
We agreed on six.

116
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:04,144
That was before he spoke to me.
It's gone back to 12, okay?

117
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:05,812
No, it is not okay,
actually.

118
00:08:05,813 --> 00:08:08,548
<i>This used to be one of the best
salmon rivers in the highlands.</i>

119
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:11,718
It's been overfished for years. If we're
not careful, there will be no fish left.

120
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:14,021
But it's still all right
for you and Hector to fish

121
00:08:14,022 --> 00:08:16,523
and maybe some of your pals
that want to make a few bob.

122
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:19,159
Excuse me? are you
accusing me of something?

123
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,729
No, I just heard how easy it is
to get hold of salmon in Glenbogle.

124
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,665
- That has nothing to do with me.
- Good.

125
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,567
So there's no confusion,
from now on,

126
00:08:27,568 --> 00:08:30,604
the only people who fish in this
river are those who pay to do

127
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:33,107
- and have my permission.
- Hector: I think not.

128
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:36,543
I've fished this river for 60
years. I don't intend to stop now.

129
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:39,079
It's none of your business.
Golly runs the sport.

130
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,547
- Quite.
- Quite.

131
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:43,683
And I run the estate. From
now on, fishing is banned.

That harpy. That gorgon!
That medusa!

138
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:01,888
She has the nerve to tell
Hector Naismith MacDonald

139
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:04,525
that he is not permitted
to fish in his own river!

140
00:11:04,526 --> 00:11:06,293
- Molly!
- Finished.

141
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:09,296
<i>Not if I have anything to do
with it. I shall continue to fish!</i>

<i>I meant my Perry Mason.</i>

143
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:15,835
- What? - It's a wonderful whodunit
by Erle Stanley Gardner.

144
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:17,904
Never heard of him.
You sure he's an earl?

145
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:20,107
Not that sort of earl.
He's an American.

146
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:22,342
<i>He wrote these books
about a lawyer-</i>

147
00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:26,046
Perry Mason, and his sidekicks.
Perry always manages to prove

148
00:11:26,047 --> 00:11:29,316
that his clients are innocent,
despite what the police-

149
00:11:29,317 --> 00:11:31,452
- Monty? Rommel?
- Hector?

150
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:33,753
I thought we were in
agreement about this weekend.

151
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:35,289
We do-

152
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,424
- Golly!
- Not now, Duncan.

153
00:11:37,425 --> 00:11:39,626
Stella went
behind my back.

154
00:11:39,627 --> 00:11:42,396
Give me a bit of time. I might
be able to find a compromise.

155
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:44,864
I suppose that's easier
than saying no to the lassie.

156
00:11:44,865 --> 00:11:47,134
- Golly, I've got
to tell you- - what?

157
00:11:50,238 --> 00:11:52,439
<i>Stella: Golly.</i>

158
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,508
I'm sorry, but the lassie insisted.

159
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:56,643
Morning, Craig. If
you're here for the fish,

160
00:11:56,644 --> 00:11:58,212
you're luck's out,
I'm afraid.

161
00:11:58,213 --> 00:12:00,614
No, sir. I'm on duty.
Ms. Moon says

162
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:03,783
you've been stealing fish.
I'm sure there's a mistake.

163
00:12:03,784 --> 00:12:05,952
<i>Stella: I saw him selling two salmon</i>

164
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:09,189
- to the driver of the grocer's van.
- She means Big Alec.

165
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,658
You don't think it might
have been a better idea

166
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:13,594
to sort this out
amongst ourselves

167
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:16,896
- rather than going straight to the police?
- I did say that.

168
00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:19,500
<i>Stella: Where did you
get the salmon from?</i>

169
00:12:19,501 --> 00:12:21,668
That's my business.

170
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:23,637
If you're stealing
property from this estate

171
00:12:23,638 --> 00:12:25,405
and selling it,
that's my business.

172
00:12:25,406 --> 00:12:28,375
This is crazy. Golly has never
stolen anything from the estate.

173
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:31,545
Then where did you get the salmon
from? It's a reasonable question.

174
00:12:31,546 --> 00:12:33,580
I can't answer that
and I shouldn't have to.

175
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:36,116
I took photos of Golly
handing over the fish

176
00:12:36,117 --> 00:12:38,118
and the van driver
paying him ï¿½50.

177
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:40,587
- Come on!
- The money's in his pocket.

178
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:41,888
Golly?

179
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:56,370
You knew about this little
arrangement, did you?

180
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:58,205
Nope. Golly?

181
00:12:58,206 --> 00:13:01,074
I thought at least
you'd be with me.

182
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:02,909
I am, but if you
could just explain.

183
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,812
Officer: I don't want to arrest
you, but you're giving me no choice.

184
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:07,581
You do what you
have to do, Andrew.

185
00:13:08,816 --> 00:13:10,651
I'm sorry.

186
00:13:18,793 --> 00:13:21,928
I've lost my card
with the caution on it.

187
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:25,765
I'll read it to you down
at the police house.

188
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:27,601
Okay.

189
00:13:43,884 --> 00:13:46,920
How am I supposed to run a
fishing weekend without Golly?

190
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:49,856
The man's a thief.
Look. there you go.

191
00:13:49,857 --> 00:13:52,859
Golly doing his bit to save
the estate's stock of fish-

192
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,395
just after he told me
he always throws them back.

193
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:57,764
What do you plan to do?
Take him to court? Sack him?

194
00:13:57,765 --> 00:14:02,536
If he's breached his terms of
employment, yes, he's sacked.

195
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:04,605
Have you any idea
what kind of trouble

196
00:14:04,606 --> 00:14:06,707
that would cause-
here and in the village?

197
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,075
I'll take that risk.

198
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:12,846
- You really don't understand how things
work around here. - And you do?

199
00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:16,583
How long has Golly been running this
little scam right under your nose?

200
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:19,453
Come on. we've got
a weekend to organize.

201
00:14:30,998 --> 00:14:34,200
- Will you not go home, Golly?
- Nope.

202
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:37,971
The thing is, I have to take
eileen over to your sister's.

203
00:14:37,972 --> 00:14:40,140
I'm used to
my own company.

204
00:14:40,141 --> 00:14:43,176
- But I'm not supposed to leave you.
- Andrew...

205
00:14:43,177 --> 00:14:45,312
I'm not going anywhere.

206
00:14:45,313 --> 00:14:47,514
If that's what you want.

207
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:53,387
I'll put
the answerphone on.

208
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:01,261
<i>( door clangs )</i>

209
00:15:01,262 --> 00:15:03,897
<i>- Liz: want an omelet?
- No, thank you.</i>

210
00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:05,766
Toast?

211
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,801
I'm fine.

212
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:20,547
- Have I done something wrong?
- It's not for me to say.

213
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:23,249
This is about Golly.
It's out of my hands.

214
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,285
You be careful,
my love.

215
00:15:25,286 --> 00:15:27,487
He's well-liked
round these parts.

216
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:30,156
<i>- is there no other way?
- No, there isn't.</i>

217
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:32,659
Not if he's stolen
from the estate.

218
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,394
Oh, I'm late.

219
00:15:37,565 --> 00:15:39,165
No Duncan this morning?

220
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,667
No.

221
00:15:40,668 --> 00:15:44,338
You know, Golly's been like
a second father to the lad.

222
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,606
Yes, I gathered that.

223
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:48,074
I'll see you.

224
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:53,079
<i>( hissing )</i>

225
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,548
<i>Oh, no.</i>

226
00:16:17,872 --> 00:16:20,874
If it was up to me,
I'd let him go.

227
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,076
He won't even
take bail.

228
00:16:23,077 --> 00:16:25,945
- We're talking two salmon here.
- I know.

229
00:16:25,946 --> 00:16:28,882
But someone's been leaning
on the superintendent.

230
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:31,651
If I don't play this
by the book,

231
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:33,653
he'll be down on me
like a ton of bricks.

232
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:44,998
How are you?

233
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:47,333
Andrew's looking
after me fine.

234
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:50,704
Lexie made this
for you.

235
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:54,674
- Is there a file in it?
- Hm, hard to tell.

236
00:16:57,278 --> 00:16:59,546
Golly, what are
we going to do?

237
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:02,348
Seems to me the ball's
in your court, son.

238
00:17:02,349 --> 00:17:04,117
<i>Stella is the one
pressing charges.</i>

239
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:06,252
I can talk to her,
but if you could explain-

240
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:08,354
I don't need to explain.
I've done nothing wrong.

241
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:10,323
There's obviously been
a misunderstanding,

242
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:12,325
but if I've got
nothing to work from-

243
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:14,761
- you saying you don't believe me?
- No.

244
00:17:14,762 --> 00:17:16,730
What is this all about?

245
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:18,665
Archie...

246
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,734
it's about cutting me
down to size.

247
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:23,369
Anyone that might know
better than her, she wants out.

248
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,705
- One way or the other.
- That's ridiculous.

249
00:17:25,706 --> 00:17:29,509
Is it? the thing that sticks in my
craw is that you're right behind her.

250
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,945
Hang on a minute. You accuse
me of not trusting you,

251
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:34,815
- how about you trusting me?
- I'd love to.

252
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:36,850
But I've just got
this sneaky feeling

253
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:38,985
that the one reason
you're here

254
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:40,921
<i>is because you need
a ghillie for the weekend.</i>

255
00:17:44,058 --> 00:17:45,792
Mmm.

256
00:17:50,331 --> 00:17:53,333
Kilwillie and I are going
to fish in the river.

257
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:56,202
We intend to catch
not one or two,

258
00:17:56,203 --> 00:17:59,038
<i>but several shoals
of salmon.</i>

259
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,740
Badger here will
then sell them

260
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:03,309
for extortionist sums
to the highest bidder.

261
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,947
And there is absolutely
nothing you can do to stop us.

262
00:18:06,948 --> 00:18:08,615
Good morning.

263
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:28,434
Hi.

264
00:18:28,435 --> 00:18:29,803
How's Golly?

265
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:31,671
Not good.

266
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:33,940
He hasn't even started
your cake yet.

267
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:35,909
What's wrong
with my cake?

268
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,111
Let me guess.
You prefer my buns.

269
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:40,279
You know, if you ever fancy a nibble-

270
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,181
I'll head straight
for the kitchen.

271
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:44,417
But in the meantime, we've
got a ton of work to do

272
00:18:44,418 --> 00:18:47,220
if this weekend's
ever going to happen.

273
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:50,690
So we collect the fishing party
at noon in the Land Rover...

274
00:18:50,691 --> 00:18:52,325
no Land Rover.

275
00:18:52,326 --> 00:18:54,394
Golly's got
the keys.

276
00:18:54,395 --> 00:18:56,229
Okay.

277
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,464
And we take the party
to the river for lunch-

278
00:18:58,465 --> 00:18:59,966
no food.

279
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,236
<i>Big Alec's blacked
the estate.</i>

280
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:04,938
Right.

281
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:08,107
And then we have
an afternoon's fishing,

282
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:09,709
but we have no ghillie.

283
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:13,446
You'll have
to cancel it.

284
00:19:13,447 --> 00:19:15,415
Teach "Cruella de Vil"
a lesson.

285
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,417
It's my weekend,
and my contacts

286
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:19,886
<i>and me who ends up looking
more stupid than ever.</i>

287
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:23,623
- It really matters to you?
- Yeah.

288
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:27,126
It means that we can show her that
we can do something for ourselves.

289
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:29,062
Some hope.

290
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:30,964
There's still time.

291
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:32,966
<i>( door opens )</i>

292
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:35,869
Hector. the police-
coming. now!

293
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:48,982
Archie: Stella!

294
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:54,420
- What are you doing, father?
- Opposing the forces of tyranny.

295
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:56,189
The question is,
what are you doing?

296
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,157
Picking up the pieces,
as usual.

297
00:20:10,638 --> 00:20:12,639
Congratulations.

298
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,641
I've been trying
to have my father

299
00:20:14,642 --> 00:20:17,143
locked up for years, and
you've actually done it.

300
00:20:17,144 --> 00:20:19,713
- Yes.
- And now you're calling the police again.

301
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:22,983
I'm not calling anyone. The
phone's have stopped working.

302
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:25,018
- Why?
- Probably the same reason

303
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:27,453
why my car had four
flat tires this morning.

304
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:32,191
Great. Just when everything
was going so well.

305
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:35,428
I can't even call my friends
to cancel the weekend.

306
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:37,196
What?

307
00:20:37,197 --> 00:20:39,298
There's not much point in
them coming now, is there?

308
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,168
- We have no food, no transport.
- We can sort that out.

309
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:44,270
Maybe we can, but we still
don't have a ghillie.

310
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:46,239
- What about Duncan?
- He won't do it.

311
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,974
Let's ask him. Duncan!

312
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:50,110
Yes?

313
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:51,911
I was just passing.

314
00:20:51,912 --> 00:20:55,048
Isn't that lucky? We were
just talking about you.

315
00:20:56,917 --> 00:21:00,086
<i>Duncan...
how would you</i>

316
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:02,255
like to be ghillie?

317
00:21:02,256 --> 00:21:04,423
That's Golly's job.

318
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:06,926
Yes, but he might not
be here this weekend.

319
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:09,495
I don't know much about
the fishing side of things-

320
00:21:09,496 --> 00:21:12,832
don't put yourself down.
You're always doing that.

321
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,234
I see great things
ahead for you.

322
00:21:15,235 --> 00:21:18,772
You're bright and ambitious.
You'll do a great job.

323
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:23,576
I can't.

324
00:21:23,577 --> 00:21:26,746
<i>Oh, please, Duncan.</i>

325
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,350
As a favor to me.

326
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:37,991
- Okay.
- Great. thank you.

327
00:21:43,197 --> 00:21:45,331
<i>Archie: Grab your
waders and I'll give you</i>

328
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:46,966
a crash course in fishing.

329
00:21:53,174 --> 00:21:55,541
See? it wasn't that hard.

330
00:22:05,586 --> 00:22:07,787
<i>- Andrew: Will you accept a caution?
- Certainly not!</i>

331
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:09,222
We demand to be
locked up.

332
00:22:09,223 --> 00:22:11,758
If that's what
you want.

333
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,361
- I have to ask you some questions.
- Remember, Kilwillie,

334
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:18,031
name, rank, serial number,
and not a word more.

335
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,834
Can I have your name,
lord Kilwillie?

336
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:23,770
Kilwillie.

337
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:25,772
I need your full names.

338
00:22:27,808 --> 00:22:30,643
Angus Errol...

339
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:33,813
( mumbles )

340
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:37,150
I didn't catch that.

341
00:22:38,585 --> 00:22:40,553
Sharon.

342
00:22:40,554 --> 00:22:43,923
My father was stationed in that
particular part of palestine.

343
00:22:43,924 --> 00:22:46,425
- It's a man's name there.
- Good lord.

344
00:22:48,295 --> 00:22:50,029
Sharon.

345
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:53,666
Address?

346
00:22:54,835 --> 00:22:56,669
Kilwillie Castle.
Scotland.

347
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,806
- Do you have the post code?
- No.

348
00:22:59,807 --> 00:23:02,642
Telephone my man. He deals
with that sort of thing.

349
00:23:04,478 --> 00:23:05,611
And you,
Mr. MacDonald?

350
00:23:05,612 --> 00:23:07,814
Hector Naismith
MacDonald.

351
00:23:07,815 --> 00:23:09,382
<i>Glenbogle House.</i>

352
00:23:09,383 --> 00:23:12,351
And I will not reveal the
post code, even under torture.

353
00:23:12,352 --> 00:23:14,187
I have it here anyway.

354
00:23:15,422 --> 00:23:17,723
Right, if you'd just
empty your pockets

355
00:23:17,724 --> 00:23:20,059
and hand over your belts
and shoelaces,

356
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,494
you too,
Mr. MacDonald.

357
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:25,431
Both:
Really.

358
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:28,668
You're not going to get yourself
arrested too, are you, Archie?

359
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:30,303
No, I'm too busy
for that.

360
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,105
( reel whirrs )

361
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,611
What are we going to
do about your father?

362
00:23:38,612 --> 00:23:40,546
I think he can
look after himself.

363
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:43,382
But he's banged up with the
hard men and the tough nuts.

364
00:23:43,383 --> 00:23:45,518
The most awful things
happen in choky.

365
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,254
Knife fights, drug smuggling,
monkey business in the showers.

366
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:51,291
Glenbogle Police Station
isn't exactly Barlinnie,

367
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:54,627
and it's quite useful having him
out of the house at the moment.

368
00:23:54,628 --> 00:23:56,930
I have a plan.
You know Occam's Razor?

369
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:59,498
The simplest solution is
usually the best one?

370
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:01,301
I have come across it.

371
00:24:01,302 --> 00:24:04,170
I've found in this house,
the opposite usually applies,

372
00:24:04,171 --> 00:24:08,241
but with the sword of truth
and the trusty shield of justice

373
00:24:08,242 --> 00:24:10,376
I will release
the Glenbogle Three.

374
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:15,614
<i>- It might be easier than teaching Duncan
how to fish. - ( glass breaking )</i>

375
00:24:15,615 --> 00:24:18,818
Don't forget, old man, stone
walls do not a prison make.

376
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:22,621
- Actually, old boy, I rather think they do.
- ( exasperated sigh )

377
00:24:27,394 --> 00:24:28,995
What are you doing?

378
00:24:28,996 --> 00:24:30,964
I'm trying to make
contact with Golly.

379
00:24:30,965 --> 00:24:33,132
He'll remember
the old morse code.

380
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:36,469
Now let's try...
"hello, Golly. "

381
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,372
- ï¿½ you're looking
swell, Golly- ï¿½ - please!

382
00:24:39,373 --> 00:24:40,940
This is no
laughing matter.

383
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:43,042
Now, "h"...

384
00:24:44,845 --> 00:24:46,645
"e"...

385
00:24:46,646 --> 00:24:48,748
<i>- oh, damn, that's an "a. "
- Hector.</i>

386
00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:51,251
I can hear every word
you're saying.

387
00:24:51,252 --> 00:24:52,585
<i>- Can you?
- yes.</i>

388
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:54,354
Excellent.
Just to tell you,

389
00:24:54,355 --> 00:24:56,356
we're standing
shoulder-to-shoulder

390
00:24:56,357 --> 00:24:57,891
with you in your
hour of need.

391
00:24:57,892 --> 00:24:59,625
- Me too.
- Don't butt in.

392
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:02,728
- That's very good of you.
- Thank you very much, Golly.

393
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:04,964
Here we are.
Communication's established.

394
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:11,004
Right, this afternoon we
need to make up 12 bedrooms,

395
00:25:11,005 --> 00:25:14,607
order and collect food
for two breakfasts,

396
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:16,776
two lunches,
and two suppers.

397
00:25:16,777 --> 00:25:20,780
Clean the reception rooms
and restock with drinks.

398
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:23,549
- Have I missed anything?
- You might want to get the phone fixed.

399
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,585
Oh, yes. someone will
have to go to the village.

400
00:25:28,522 --> 00:25:31,124
- You won't get much help there.
- But you could.

401
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:34,027
No, it's my
afternoon off.

402
00:25:35,629 --> 00:25:38,364
<i>- Hold on. I need you here.
- tough.</i>

403
00:25:38,365 --> 00:25:41,700
I can only run this place
with a bit of give and take.

404
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:46,172
You should have thought of that before you
had Golly arrested. You're on your own, hen.

405
00:25:51,445 --> 00:25:54,513
What are
the most likely lies?

406
00:25:54,514 --> 00:25:56,549
That the ghillie's
been taken ill?

407
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,384
No, you're
the ghillie.

408
00:25:58,385 --> 00:26:00,453
Lies are where
you find the fish.

409
00:26:00,454 --> 00:26:02,422
You look at
the head of the pool,

410
00:26:02,423 --> 00:26:04,157
either side
of the current,

411
00:26:04,158 --> 00:26:06,059
upstream of any
rocks or obstacles,

412
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,294
and in the draw
of the pool. you got that?

413
00:26:08,295 --> 00:26:09,728
- Yeah.
- Good.

414
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:12,798
That is- no.

415
00:26:14,868 --> 00:26:16,569
<i>Right.</i>

416
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,939
Let's start again
at the very beginning.

417
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,409
I'm supposed to be at rather an
important meeting this afternoon.

418
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,079
Chap from Tokyo. He's very
big in sushi franchise.

419
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,048
He wants a round of golf at
the club. What am I to do?

420
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:32,385
Cheer up, old man. There must
be a way out of here somehow.

421
00:26:32,386 --> 00:26:35,288
What?
You mean escape?

422
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:37,090
Yes.

423
00:26:37,091 --> 00:26:39,292
We could
build a tunnel.

424
00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:40,826
You know the drill-
vaulting horse,

425
00:26:40,827 --> 00:26:43,596
sand down the trouser
leg, bob's your uncle.

426
00:26:43,597 --> 00:26:45,798
Which of us would
get to do the vaulting?

427
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:48,834
- I'm not sure my hip's up to it.
- Oh, poor old thing.

428
00:26:48,835 --> 00:26:51,037
We could
disguise ourselves,

429
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:52,972
as Gestapo officers.

430
00:26:52,973 --> 00:26:55,908
We might stand out
a bit in Glenbogle.

431
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:58,044
True, true.

432
00:26:59,213 --> 00:27:01,014
We could always
build a glider.

433
00:27:02,282 --> 00:27:05,618
<i>- Are those the keys there?
- good lord.</i>

434
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:07,586
You're a positive Houdini,
Kilwillie.

435
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,724
<i>- Bye, Al.
- bye, Liz.</i>

436
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:13,726
Ooh, miss!

437
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:16,829
- I want the word on the street.
- The word on the street?

438
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,299
- Hot fish. have you heard any whispers?
- Hot fish?

439
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,967
Don't think so.

440
00:27:21,968 --> 00:27:24,337
Never mind. I've been doing rather well.

441
00:27:24,338 --> 00:27:27,640
- But I need to shoot the breeze
with the filth. - I'm sorry?

442
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:29,808
The pigs.
The Glenbogle P.D.-

443
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:31,777
oh! must go. Got a hot lead to follow.

444
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:34,180
Down these mean streets
and all that.

445
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:46,392
- Oh! well done.
- Landing net.

446
00:27:46,393 --> 00:27:48,027
Yes, yes.
There, there.

447
00:27:49,763 --> 00:27:51,330
<i>Steady, steady.
Don't panic.</i>

448
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:53,366
<i>- argh!
- Damn.</i>

449
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:56,069
Got away.

450
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,671
Which is more
than we're likely to.

451
00:27:58,672 --> 00:27:59,805
Ha!

452
00:28:01,741 --> 00:28:03,276
You dropped these.

453
00:28:03,277 --> 00:28:04,977
How did you do that?

454
00:28:04,978 --> 00:28:07,046
Andrew never locks
the cells.

455
00:28:07,047 --> 00:28:10,683
- Then we're free. - What happened
to standing shoulder-to-shoulder?

456
00:28:10,684 --> 00:28:13,752
- I think we've made our point.
- And I appreciate it.

457
00:28:13,753 --> 00:28:16,089
But there's no need
for you to stay now.

458
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:19,858
- Of course we'll stay.
- This is my fight, Hector. Not yours.

459
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:22,661
Nonsense. all for one,
and one for all.

460
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:29,635
What about my golf?

461
00:28:29,636 --> 00:28:32,271
<i>Who's side are you on?
Golly's or the boche?</i>

462
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:37,910
( grunting )

463
00:28:47,321 --> 00:28:49,122
Oh, god.

464
00:28:49,123 --> 00:28:51,124
How's our new ghillie?

465
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,759
See for yourself.

466
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,828
Try again, Duncan.

467
00:28:59,032 --> 00:29:00,699
( grunts )

468
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,835
How long
have we got?

469
00:29:02,836 --> 00:29:04,870
Hmm, about 18 hours.

470
00:29:04,871 --> 00:29:06,872
We'll just have
to keep at it

471
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:09,509
and hope that nothing else goes wrong.

472
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,144
<i>( explosion )</i>

473
00:29:11,145 --> 00:29:13,879
- What the hell was that?
- Poachers.

474
00:29:26,926 --> 00:29:29,195
Are you sure this
is the right place?

475
00:29:29,196 --> 00:29:31,664
Salmon don't usually
leap this high.

476
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:34,367
<i>There they are.</i>

477
00:29:35,636 --> 00:29:36,636
Hey!

478
00:29:41,308 --> 00:29:43,442
No, no. let me.

479
00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:45,144
You! stop!

480
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:46,712
You've had it now!

481
00:29:49,183 --> 00:29:51,083
Just leave it,
mate!

482
00:29:53,753 --> 00:29:56,389
I've got you, pal!

483
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,457
Duncan!

484
00:30:21,548 --> 00:30:24,883
- They got away.
- No kidding.

485
00:30:28,255 --> 00:30:29,689
( reel whirrs )

486
00:30:33,727 --> 00:30:35,461
<i>( door opens )</i>

487
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,702
<i>Stella:
Thank heaven we're back.</i>

488
00:30:42,703 --> 00:30:44,604
<i>I'm dying
for a cup of tea.</i>

489
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:01,287
( water dripping )

490
00:31:01,288 --> 00:31:03,623
This place is completely
impossible.

491
00:31:07,561 --> 00:31:09,795
Yes, it is impossible.

492
00:31:09,796 --> 00:31:13,666
And uncomfortable,
out of date, uneconomic.

493
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:19,672
But then... you fall in love with it.

494
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:24,710
I'm here to do a job,
not fall in love.

495
00:31:24,711 --> 00:31:27,546
Running Glenbogle
isn't just a job.

496
00:31:27,547 --> 00:31:29,848
<i>There's something
special here.</i>

497
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:32,285
A way of life that's been
developed over the centuries.

498
00:31:32,286 --> 00:31:33,952
It's organic.

499
00:31:33,953 --> 00:31:36,855
You have to work with the
grain, not cut across it.

500
00:31:36,856 --> 00:31:38,891
Which is just
a fancy way of asking me

501
00:31:38,892 --> 00:31:40,926
to change my mind
about Golly and Hector.

502
00:31:40,927 --> 00:31:43,529
You won't win in court tomorrow.
Stewart Usher, the sheriff,

503
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,765
<i>he's an old friend
of the family's.</i>

504
00:31:45,766 --> 00:31:48,066
My father could rape and pillage
his way across the highlands,

505
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:50,636
and old Stewart would still
find there was no case to answer.

506
00:31:50,637 --> 00:31:52,305
Hooray for the old
school tie.

507
00:31:52,306 --> 00:31:54,039
The same goes for Golly
and Kilwillie.

508
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:58,010
How about it?
Drop the charges.

509
00:31:58,011 --> 00:31:59,412
Let Golly get back
to the river

510
00:31:59,413 --> 00:32:01,414
before there are
no salmon left to save.

511
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:05,083
No, if I do that,
that's me finished.

512
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:07,252
<i>I'm not giving in
to blackmail.</i>

513
00:32:07,253 --> 00:32:09,522
If you want to look stupid
in court tomorrow,

514
00:32:09,523 --> 00:32:10,856
<i>that's fine by me.
Go ahead.</i>

515
00:32:10,857 --> 00:32:13,058
Let's just talk about
tomorrow, shall we?

516
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:15,461
There's no food,
probably no fish,

517
00:32:15,462 --> 00:32:19,332
and with Duncan as ghillie, you've got
the clown prince of the gamekeeping world.

518
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:22,702
<i>I'd be a damn sight more worried
about that if I were you, pal!</i>

519
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:36,649
( knocking )

520
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:40,453
- Can I have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

521
00:32:50,163 --> 00:32:54,299
It's very awkward for me,
you staying here.

522
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,502
I'm sorry.

523
00:32:56,503 --> 00:33:01,006
My neighbors, my friends,
they're Golly's friends, too.

524
00:33:01,007 --> 00:33:03,609
It's like I'm letting
them down.

525
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,111
<i>You see
what I'm saying?</i>

526
00:33:06,112 --> 00:33:08,146
You want me
to leave.

527
00:33:08,147 --> 00:33:09,682
Yes.

528
00:33:11,284 --> 00:33:13,986
Right now?

529
00:33:13,987 --> 00:33:17,155
Oh, no.
But tomorrow.

530
00:33:17,156 --> 00:33:19,958
If that's
what you want.

531
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:23,429
I'm sorry, Stella.
I really am.

532
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,297
But you've given me
no choice.

533
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:27,433
There's nothing more to say
then, is there? Good night.

534
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:31,504
Good night.

535
00:33:40,614 --> 00:33:42,882
Lex, I'm not
in the mood for all this.

536
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:44,983
Keep your eyes
closed.

537
00:33:48,422 --> 00:33:51,857
You can open
your eyes- ta-da!

538
00:33:51,858 --> 00:33:54,393
- Where did this come from?
- Well, here and there.

539
00:33:54,394 --> 00:33:57,863
- How did you get it?
- I sold my body. That sort of thing.

540
00:33:57,864 --> 00:33:59,899
Why?

541
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,535
Why do you think?
For you.

542
00:34:02,536 --> 00:34:05,270
Thanks, Lex. I don't know
what I'd do without you.

543
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:11,944
I won't forget this.

544
00:34:30,931 --> 00:34:33,098
Who fixed the tires?

545
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:35,000
Duncan did it
yesterday.

546
00:34:36,503 --> 00:34:38,471
Well, I'll be
off then.

547
00:34:38,472 --> 00:34:40,573
Where will you go?

548
00:34:40,574 --> 00:34:42,975
I'll find somewhere.

549
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:47,112
- This week's rent.
- That's far too much.

550
00:34:47,113 --> 00:34:49,615
I don't want you to lose
out because of all this.

551
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:51,951
Thank you
for looking after me.

552
00:34:51,952 --> 00:34:53,886
You really made me
feel at home.

553
00:34:59,025 --> 00:35:01,627
You take care
of yourself, eh?

554
00:35:01,628 --> 00:35:03,028
I will.

555
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,868
Have you seen
Duncan?

556
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:10,469
Nope. sorry.

557
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,404
I need him to help
with my inquiries.

558
00:35:12,405 --> 00:35:15,207
- He could be the missing link.
- Well, he's definitely missing.

559
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:17,543
I want the lowdown,
the inside track,

560
00:35:17,544 --> 00:35:20,312
some info about Golly.
I'm relying on him.

561
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:22,147
<i>Mother...</i>

562
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,485
<i>I'll find Duncan.
We'll see you in court.</i>

563
00:35:26,486 --> 00:35:28,954
( Jeffries speaking )

564
00:35:28,955 --> 00:35:30,856
"... Lascelles Bank versus

565
00:35:30,857 --> 00:35:34,393
MacDonald, Kilwillie
and MacKenzie. "

566
00:35:34,394 --> 00:35:36,862
What's the plan
of action?

567
00:35:36,863 --> 00:35:39,164
There is no plan.

568
00:35:39,165 --> 00:35:40,900
Oh.

569
00:35:40,901 --> 00:35:43,836
I don't think I can manage
another night in that bottom bunk.

570
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:46,672
- It's absolute purgatory for the back.
- Don't worry, Kilwillie.

571
00:35:46,673 --> 00:35:48,774
Stewart usher will have us
released in no time.

572
00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:51,109
- No, he won't.
- Why on earth not?

573
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,712
Stewart's not sitting today.
Last minute change.

574
00:35:53,713 --> 00:35:57,449
Skullduggery in the chamber,
I bet. Who have we got instead?

575
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:00,686
- Phillip Jeffries.
- Never heard of him.

576
00:36:00,687 --> 00:36:02,988
Here's his entry
in "Who's Who. "

577
00:36:04,357 --> 00:36:06,391
<i>Hector: Let's have a look. Where is he?</i>

578
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,695
Grammar school boy.

579
00:36:09,696 --> 00:36:11,997
He's a member of
the vegetarian society.

580
00:36:11,998 --> 00:36:14,533
Scots nationalist?

581
00:36:14,534 --> 00:36:17,803
And a former legal adviser
to Lascelles Bank.

582
00:36:17,804 --> 00:36:22,107
<i>- I smell a rat.
- Hector: nil desperandum.</i>

583
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:24,977
Our advocate will make mincemeat
of these trumped-up charges.

584
00:36:24,978 --> 00:36:28,113
- Who is our advocate?
- Me, of course.

585
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,218
How do the defendants plead
in answer to the charge?

586
00:36:33,219 --> 00:36:34,787
Not guilty.

587
00:36:34,788 --> 00:36:37,690
Not guilty,
and proud of it.

588
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:39,257
Not guilty.

589
00:36:39,258 --> 00:36:40,826
( knocking )

590
00:36:40,827 --> 00:36:42,094
Duncan!

591
00:36:51,337 --> 00:36:54,807
Do you have any further questions
for this witness, Mrs. MacDonald?

592
00:36:54,808 --> 00:36:57,142
Ahem...

593
00:36:59,378 --> 00:37:02,447
what possible good
can the...

594
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:12,725
prosecution of these...

595
00:37:13,793 --> 00:37:16,328
three men do?

596
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:19,098
I'm employed by Lascelles
Bank, the current owner

597
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:21,867
of all the assets
of the Glenbogle estate.

598
00:37:28,808 --> 00:37:30,408
Dunc...?

599
00:37:33,113 --> 00:37:35,681
What are you doing?
We need you.

600
00:37:35,682 --> 00:37:37,149
Me?

601
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,818
I thought I was "the clown
prince of gamekeeping. "

602
00:37:39,819 --> 00:37:43,355
<i>Oh, you heard that.</i>

603
00:37:43,356 --> 00:37:45,357
What Stella said,
it wasn't fair.

604
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:49,261
It was in the heat of the moment
at the end of a very hard day.

605
00:37:49,262 --> 00:37:52,464
( sighs ) That's what she thinks of me.

606
00:37:52,465 --> 00:37:56,168
I was stupid enough to think
she might take me seriously...

607
00:37:57,403 --> 00:37:59,938
and I let Golly down
because of it.

608
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:02,007
No, this is all
down to me.

609
00:38:02,008 --> 00:38:05,343
I thought you could do a job
it takes a lifetime to learn.

610
00:38:05,344 --> 00:38:08,013
That's not what I'm saying.
I let Golly down.

611
00:38:08,014 --> 00:38:12,151
He's locked up because of me.
This is all my fault.

612
00:38:12,152 --> 00:38:14,920
There is a way
you can help him.

613
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:17,455
Do you wish to call any more
witnesses, Mrs. MacDonald?

614
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:19,925
Could we have
an abscess?

615
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:22,895
<i>- ( scattered laughter )
- Do you mean a recess?</i>

616
00:38:22,896 --> 00:38:25,330
Yes.

617
00:38:25,331 --> 00:38:29,401
<i>I was hoping that there might be
one last piece of the defense jigsaw.</i>

618
00:38:29,402 --> 00:38:32,705
- Is the witness here?
- Not entirely.

619
00:38:32,706 --> 00:38:35,708
We've spent enough time
on this matter already.

620
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:37,843
Oh, dear.

621
00:38:37,844 --> 00:38:41,046
If there's no further evidence, we
can wrap it up without further ado-

622
00:38:41,047 --> 00:38:43,048
oh, wait.
He's here.

623
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:45,650
Would you take
the stand, dear?

624
00:38:48,988 --> 00:38:51,456
Have you got any idea what's going on?

625
00:38:51,457 --> 00:38:53,025
Not the foggiest.

626
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:55,560
"... will be the truth,
the whole truth,

627
00:38:55,561 --> 00:38:57,295
and nothing
but the truth. "

628
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,536
There's something you
want to tell us, dear?

629
00:39:04,537 --> 00:39:09,407
The fish that Golly
sold to Big Alec...

630
00:39:09,408 --> 00:39:11,276
<i>he got them from me.</i>

631
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:13,612
<i>- You caught them, dear?
- Mrs. MacDonald-</i>

632
00:39:13,613 --> 00:39:16,615
you must not call
the witness "dear. "

633
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:18,650
Sorry, dear.
You were saying?

634
00:39:18,651 --> 00:39:20,518
<i>My auntie Liz,</i>

635
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:22,888
- she gave me the fish.
- Did she catch them?

636
00:39:22,889 --> 00:39:25,557
No.

637
00:39:25,558 --> 00:39:29,427
Mr. Badger, that works
at Kilwillie House,

638
00:39:29,428 --> 00:39:31,596
he's soft
on my auntie Liz.

639
00:39:31,597 --> 00:39:33,698
Badger?

640
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:35,700
<i>Molly:
So, he gives her fish?</i>

641
00:39:35,701 --> 00:39:38,336
<i>- I think that's lovely.
- she says...</i>

642
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:40,906
"he doesn't say it with flowers,
he says it with fish. "

643
00:39:40,907 --> 00:39:42,775
Why couldn't Golly
have told us this?

644
00:39:42,776 --> 00:39:46,678
Because
if Lord Kilwillie

645
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:49,547
found out that Badger
was taking all those fish,

646
00:39:49,548 --> 00:39:51,549
he'd lose his job.

647
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,153
<i>And then...
there's Mrs. Badger.</i>

648
00:39:54,154 --> 00:39:55,954
Does he give her
fish, too?

649
00:39:55,955 --> 00:39:59,291
<i>No- that's
the problem.</i>

650
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:00,893
Oh-

651
00:40:00,894 --> 00:40:04,196
so Golly was just doing
your aunt a favor?

652
00:40:04,197 --> 00:40:06,965
Yeah. he knew that she
was strapped for cash.

653
00:40:06,966 --> 00:40:08,700
He was just
helping her out.

654
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:11,703
He'd never let her-
he'd never let anybody down.

655
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:15,674
Ms. McSweeney?

656
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:17,342
<i>Do you wish
to cross-examine?</i>

657
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:19,812
No questions.

658
00:40:19,813 --> 00:40:23,381
Do you propose to call any
more witnesses, Mrs. MacDonald?

659
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:25,784
Yes, I'd like
to recall Golly.

660
00:40:33,293 --> 00:40:35,393
Jeffries: You're still under oath.

661
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:39,097
My husband and Kilwillie, how
would you rate them as fishermen?

662
00:40:39,098 --> 00:40:42,167
Rate them? er...

663
00:40:42,168 --> 00:40:45,704
well, they both over the years
have had a lot of practice.

664
00:40:45,705 --> 00:40:49,574
By which you mean,
they're pretty hopeless?

665
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:51,476
<i>Golly:
No, no...</i>

666
00:40:51,477 --> 00:40:54,479
what I would say...

667
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,282
is that they give the salmon
a sporting chance.

668
00:40:57,283 --> 00:41:01,153
According to Stella Moon,
my husband and Kilwillie

669
00:41:01,154 --> 00:41:05,190
<i>went to the river and caught
two salmon in 20 minutes.</i>

670
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:07,592
<i>Do you find that
surprising?</i>

671
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:11,596
Yes, a little.
As far as I know,

672
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:14,432
neither gentleman
has caught a single salmon

673
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:17,002
in the last...
five years.

674
00:41:17,003 --> 00:41:21,406
<i>Molly: Can I ask you
to look at exhibit b?</i>

675
00:41:23,142 --> 00:41:25,344
<i>Molly: According to Stella
Moon, these are the salmon</i>

676
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:29,481
that my husband and Kilwillie
caught in the Glenbogle river.

677
00:41:29,482 --> 00:41:31,583
Do you have any reason
to doubt that?

678
00:41:31,584 --> 00:41:35,153
These are farmed salmon.
You can tell by the tails.

679
00:41:35,154 --> 00:41:39,258
Is it possible that
Hector and Kilwillie

680
00:41:39,259 --> 00:41:43,061
<i>could have purchased the
salmon from Big Alec's shop,</i>

681
00:41:43,062 --> 00:41:45,730
and then pretended
that they'd caught them?

682
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:47,966
I don't know about that,
but these...

683
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:50,903
they've still got
the bar code on them.

684
00:41:50,904 --> 00:41:54,606
<i>Molly:
I rest my case.</i>

685
00:41:54,607 --> 00:41:57,642
<i>Jeffries: Thank you, Mrs. MacDonald.</i>

686
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:59,611
<i>Ms. McSweeney?</i>

687
00:41:59,612 --> 00:42:01,380
No further questions.

688
00:42:04,284 --> 00:42:07,485
I dismiss all charges
in this case.

689
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:09,054
( applause, cheers )

690
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:11,290
Quiet!

691
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:13,658
<i>I should not let
this moment pass</i>

692
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:16,494
without a word to the
prime mover in this case-

693
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:18,330
<i>Ms. Moon.</i>

694
00:42:18,331 --> 00:42:21,033
<i>I take great exception</i>

695
00:42:21,034 --> 00:42:23,835
to this kind of petty
and vexatious litigation.

696
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:26,405
<i>You have wasted the court's
time, and made yourself</i>

697
00:42:26,406 --> 00:42:28,840
<i>look thoroughly foolish
in the process.</i>

698
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:32,144
I would advise you
in the strongest possible terms,

699
00:42:32,145 --> 00:42:34,112
<i>not to do it again.</i>

700
00:42:34,113 --> 00:42:36,648
This court is adjourned.

701
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,291
Hector: It wasn't my
salmon being poached,

702
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:48,860
- it was yours, Kilwillie.
- I had rather gathered that.

703
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:50,963
Molly: Now, Kilwillie,
go easy on Badger.

704
00:42:50,964 --> 00:42:53,298
I will, but I can't
vouch for Mrs. Badger.

705
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:55,934
- No hard feelings, I hope?
- I don't know, my dear.

706
00:42:55,935 --> 00:42:59,371
My good name's been sullied,
dragged through the mire.

707
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:01,306
But you were found
not guilty.

708
00:43:01,307 --> 00:43:04,109
Yes, and now
it's public knowledge

709
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,378
that I haven't caught
a salmon in years.

710
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,247
What about me?

711
00:43:20,626 --> 00:43:22,727
Stella?

712
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:24,629
Hay fever.

713
00:43:25,931 --> 00:43:28,400
That would be
the heather.

714
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:30,302
Here.

715
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:32,137
Thank you.

716
00:43:38,478 --> 00:43:40,112
Better?

717
00:43:40,113 --> 00:43:42,647
I should think
I'll get over it.

718
00:43:42,648 --> 00:43:45,217
Have you come
to put the boot in?

719
00:43:45,218 --> 00:43:48,153
No, it's not
my style.

720
00:43:48,154 --> 00:43:51,923
No, it isn't,
is it?

721
00:43:51,924 --> 00:43:54,059
Lots of people
would have.

722
00:43:56,762 --> 00:44:00,032
I should have listened
to you, Archie.

723
00:44:00,033 --> 00:44:02,567
I am so sorry.

724
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:07,072
I just thought I was doing
the right thing.

725
00:44:07,073 --> 00:44:11,109
And look where it got me-
humiliated and homeless.

726
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:16,548
Yeah, I heard...

727
00:44:16,549 --> 00:44:18,917
that you and Liz
had parted company.

728
00:44:18,918 --> 00:44:21,019
Where are you
going to go?

729
00:44:24,723 --> 00:44:26,491
You're not going
to leave us, are you?

730
00:44:26,492 --> 00:44:29,094
<i>We've got
a long way to go yet.</i>

731
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:33,265
Well,
I thought about it,

732
00:44:33,266 --> 00:44:36,000
but I don't give up
that easily.

733
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:38,303
<i>It's not my style.</i>

734
00:44:38,304 --> 00:44:39,837
( Stella laughs )

735
00:44:41,474 --> 00:44:43,808
I'm just
moving house.

736
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:45,377
Where to?

737
00:44:45,378 --> 00:44:48,313
Good question.

738
00:44:52,518 --> 00:44:55,153
Hector: We met the
barbarian at the gate,

739
00:44:55,154 --> 00:44:58,590
and put it aflight.
A toast to independence day.

740
00:44:58,591 --> 00:45:00,158
All:
Independence day.

741
00:45:01,727 --> 00:45:04,596
And Molly, old girl, didn't
know you had it in you.

742
00:45:04,597 --> 00:45:06,698
All that legal
mumbo-jumbo?

743
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:08,600
<i>Oh, that was
Perry Mason.</i>

744
00:45:08,601 --> 00:45:10,402
But never mind
about me.

745
00:45:10,403 --> 00:45:12,404
The real hero
of the day was Duncan.

746
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,341
There you are.
Been waiting on you.

747
00:45:16,342 --> 00:45:18,810
Let me take a photograph
of the two of you.

748
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:20,545
<i>Lexie, I hear
you've been doing</i>

749
00:45:20,546 --> 00:45:22,514
heroic work getting things
ready for our guests.

750
00:45:24,717 --> 00:45:26,618
- Happy?
- Yeah.

751
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:28,786
So are we going
to celebrate?

752
00:45:28,787 --> 00:45:30,622
That's what
we're doing.

753
00:45:30,623 --> 00:45:33,425
I could think
of better ways.

754
00:45:33,426 --> 00:45:36,861
Look, Lex,
this is a working day.

755
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:38,896
Could you make up
another room, please?

756
00:45:38,897 --> 00:45:40,898
I think the one is the
blue corridor is free.

757
00:45:40,899 --> 00:45:43,268
This house is taking in
more paying guests

758
00:45:43,269 --> 00:45:46,404
than a Parisian knocking-shop
on Bastille Day.

759
00:45:46,405 --> 00:45:48,906
This isn't
a paying guest.

760
00:45:48,907 --> 00:45:51,843
Then, who is it,
if it's not-

761
00:45:56,582 --> 00:45:58,517
hi.

762
00:46:01,053 --> 00:46:02,220
( sighs )

763
00:46:27,146 --> 00:46:30,415
Do your predictions
usually come true?

764
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:33,418
About half of them,
I'd say.

765
00:46:33,419 --> 00:46:36,254
Trouble is, I have no idea
which half it will be.

766
00:46:39,124 --> 00:46:41,193
I've got a faint idea.

767
00:46:41,194 --> 00:46:43,127
Coffee?

768
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:58,243
That woman threw me
into jail,

769
00:46:58,244 --> 00:47:00,278
now you invite her
to live with us.

770
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:02,214
Have you taken leave
of your senses?

771
00:47:02,215 --> 00:47:05,584
Stella has come to help save
Glenbogle. We might not like her style

772
00:47:05,585 --> 00:47:07,385
or her way of doing things, but
she's the only chance we've got.

773
00:47:07,386 --> 00:47:10,455
Either we help her or we can
say goodbye to our home forever.

774
00:47:10,456 --> 00:47:13,191
- That might be a price worth paying.
- You don't mean that.

775
00:47:13,192 --> 00:47:16,328
Don't I? for centuries,
we MacDonalds have fought

776
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:18,363
against the invaders
and put them to flight.

777
00:47:18,364 --> 00:47:20,064
Not now, though.
Not a bit of it.

778
00:47:20,065 --> 00:47:23,535
Hundreds of years of proud
tradition thrown out the window.

779
00:47:23,536 --> 00:47:26,671
There is also a highland
tradition of treating visitors

780
00:47:26,672 --> 00:47:29,941
with courtesy and good manners.
At least we owe that to Stella.

781
00:47:29,942 --> 00:47:33,545
- Oh, really-!
- Can I join you?

782
00:47:33,546 --> 00:47:36,781
Oh...
yes, of course.

783
00:47:36,782 --> 00:47:38,850
We were...

784
00:47:38,851 --> 00:47:41,586
just going in
to... dinner.

785
00:47:47,192 --> 00:47:49,628
It's good to have
you back, Golly.

786
00:48:01,073 --> 00:48:03,908
( bagpipe playing )

787
00:48:03,909 --> 00:48:07,279
She's so...
so...

788
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,046
out of your league?

789
00:48:10,483 --> 00:48:13,951
( sighs ) Join the club. Come on.

790
00:48:18,758 --> 00:48:21,125
Do I know
these people?

791
00:48:21,126 --> 00:48:23,361
They're here
for the fishing.

792
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:26,264
Oh. I suppose you're going
to have them locked up?

793
00:48:26,265 --> 00:48:28,600
If the one in
the red dicky bow

794
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:30,802
plays footsie with me
one more time,

795
00:48:30,803 --> 00:48:32,671
I'll do more
than lock him up.

796
00:48:32,672 --> 00:48:35,840
Ah... I recommend

797
00:48:35,841 --> 00:48:38,943
the claymore
hanging in the hall.

798
00:48:38,944 --> 00:48:42,447
That's if he survives the
food, of course. Ah, Lexie!

799
00:48:44,183 --> 00:48:46,851
- Can I serve you, madam?
- Yes, please. what is it?

800
00:48:46,852 --> 00:48:48,687
It's your favorite...

801
00:48:48,688 --> 00:48:50,988
poached salmon.

802
00:48:54,427 --> 00:48:57,128
