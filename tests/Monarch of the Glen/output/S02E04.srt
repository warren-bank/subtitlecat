1
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,767
Ahh... mine, I think.

2
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:21,536
Just get...

3
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:23,372
dirty magazines,
Hector?

4
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:25,173
Huh!
At your age!

5
00:00:25,174 --> 00:00:26,541
Please!

6
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:33,615
Good morning, Archie.

7
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:46,661
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

8
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:27,802
It's from Lizzie.

9
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:29,571
Is she coming up?

10
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:32,640
I'm sure my sister has better
things to do than rush up here

11
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:34,309
just because
it's my birthday.

12
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,745
Archie, it's not just any
birthday. It's a special birthday.

13
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:40,982
I just wish everyone would
forget about it- I want to.

14
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:43,351
And what about you, father?

15
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:45,653
Isn't this your cue
for a special speech?

16
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:49,857
- What speech is that, lad? - The same
speech we've heard every day this week.

17
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:51,993
The one that goes,
"when I was your age,

18
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:55,230
I'd liberated europe from the
hun and sired half a polo team. "

19
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:59,101
Archie, you're a grown man.

20
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:01,636
You don't need me
interfering in your future.

21
00:02:01,637 --> 00:02:03,037
Right.
That's settled then.

22
00:02:03,038 --> 00:02:04,739
No fuss.

23
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,907
Both:
No fuss.

24
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:07,109
Good.

25
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,681
Gather the troops, Lexie.
Boathouse, five minutes.

26
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,218
Ahh...

27
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:25,594
<i>Duncan: It's just that I thought</i>

28
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:27,562
I'd have more
responsibility.

29
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:28,763
Did you?

30
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:30,865
I mean, assistant
head ranger...

31
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,835
I'm still
just a skivvy!

32
00:02:33,836 --> 00:02:35,237
Will you change
the record!

33
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,772
It's Archie's ear you
should be bending, not mine.

34
00:02:37,773 --> 00:02:40,442
Aye, and maybe he doesn't
think I'm up to it.

35
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:43,245
Duncan, you'll never
know unless you ask.

36
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,513
Report for duty.

37
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:46,348
What duty?

38
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,416
Children's
party detail.

39
00:02:55,124 --> 00:02:56,858
Archie: You've done a great job

40
00:02:56,859 --> 00:02:58,826
setting up the nature trail, Fergal.

41
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:00,762
Fergal: It'll be good to try it out,

42
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,165
before the paying
punters start turning up.

43
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,732
Yeah,
that's fine by me.

44
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:07,469
Cool.
I'll tell Katrina.

45
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,537
Katrina?

46
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:10,272
Yeah.
She said the kids

47
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,140
would love to see
around the estate.

48
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:15,410
You're seeing quite
a lot of her, aren't you?

49
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:18,112
Ha! Not as much
as I'd like to.

50
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:22,917
<i>No need to wait.</i>

51
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:53,548
Now, we need to find the
fairy lights, the streamers-

52
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:55,850
and there's a banner
around the house somewhere.

53
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:58,786
We have to move quickly,
'cause Archie's going to move

54
00:03:58,787 --> 00:04:01,889
all this stuff out today
so the contractors can move in.

55
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,525
Hey... ha ha!

56
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:05,059
Look at this.
Here.

57
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,296
<i>( Molly laughing )
What a party that was!</i>

58
00:04:08,297 --> 00:04:11,433
<i>Rained all day, but we still
had the most wonderful time.</i>

59
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:13,134
Remember, Golly?

60
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:15,403
I remember a young lassie
eating too much cake

61
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:17,105
and throwing up
into the fruit punch.

62
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:18,540
Wee Jamie, he-

63
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,679
oh, it's all right.
You can talk about Jamie.

64
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,415
I wish people would
talk about him more.

65
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,051
Aww...
this was his.

66
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:34,623
It's funny. Something about
the sound of children

67
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:36,558
<i>I remember most.</i>

68
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:39,794
Shouting, arguing,
giggling, laughing.

69
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:43,365
All just seemed to say
life is wonderful.

70
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:47,235
Oh, Hector used to love
racing these with the boys.

71
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:49,170
<i>This house
was so full of joy.</i>

72
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:50,805
Then it's time
it was again.

73
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:53,174
We can start with
Archie's party tomorrow.

74
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:56,544
It'll be the best MacDonald
birthday party in the history of...

75
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:58,913
Both:
MacDonald birthday parties.

76
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,318
<i>Hector: Well, of course,
old chap, why not?</i>

77
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,053
Pop over today.
Shall we say at 4:00?

78
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:08,490
Excellent.
Thanks for ringing.

79
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:11,192
Archie will hit the roof
when he sees this!

80
00:05:11,193 --> 00:05:12,927
He'll thank me
for it later on.

81
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:14,562
We've got
to get him hitched!

82
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:16,498
Good lord,
by the time I was 30,

83
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:17,732
I had three children!

84
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,467
I know.
I was there.

85
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:20,935
Of course you were.

86
00:05:20,936 --> 00:05:23,271
He's got to live up
to his responsibility-

87
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:25,973
- ( rings )
- Hello.

88
00:05:25,974 --> 00:05:27,609
Oh, hello,
your lordship.

89
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,011
<i>Yes... yea-</i>

90
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:32,747
of course you can
bring your daughter over

91
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:34,316
to meet the laird.

92
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:37,452
<i>Yes, absolutely delighted.
Ha ha ha!</i>

93
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:39,654
Yes, bye, your lordship.

94
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:43,024
( huffs )

95
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:47,094
Katrina: You know, I
could've saved you a trip.

96
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:49,631
I've got to go up
to the big house later

97
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:51,899
to pay my rent
and tug my forelock.

98
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,969
I wanted to tell you the
good news straightaway.

99
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,738
Kids'll have a great time tomorrow.

100
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:58,506
Yeah.
Thanks.

101
00:05:58,507 --> 00:05:59,941
And you know...

102
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,609
I think you deserve
a reward.

103
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,612
Oh? And what did you have in mind?

104
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:06,180
Hmm... coffee?

105
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,584
Well, I've a million
things to do.

106
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:12,220
You can thank me
another time.

107
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:14,823
Without MI5
observing us.

108
00:06:26,101 --> 00:06:29,136
- If you'd just wait in here? Thanks.
- Thank you.

109
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,513
Molly?

110
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:40,515
Come here.

111
00:06:40,516 --> 00:06:43,651
Come see this. You're
never gonna believe this.

112
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:45,186
Look...

113
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:47,422
they're all
queueing up in here.

114
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:49,724
What? Oh!

115
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:51,593
Go get Archie
immediately.

116
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:52,527
Right.

117
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:02,637
Archie...
I was wondering...

118
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:04,506
as assistant
head ranger...

119
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,941
<i>I was think-
I was hoping</i>

120
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:09,176
that I'd get
to be showing some

121
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:11,178
of the trekking
parties around.

122
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,385
Forget it.
Bad idea.

123
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:18,820
No, it's a good idea.

124
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:20,955
You know the place
as well as anyone.

125
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:22,457
I'll talk to Fergal
about it.

126
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:27,796
Right!
Thanks!

127
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:29,163
I won't
let you down.

128
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:38,239
Arch, Hector wants to see you in the
ballroom, matter of extreme urgency.

129
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:50,552
Thank you, Alexandra.

130
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,487
<i>( clock striking )</i>

131
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:59,794
- Lovely to see you again, Gordon.
- You too, old chap.

132
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,066
<i>Molly:
The, um...</i>

133
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,234
the last time
that we saw you,

134
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:09,236
the girls were...
how old?

135
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:11,706
- Both: 12.
- ( giggling )

136
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:13,508
That'll be all, Lexie.

137
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,814
( laughs pleasantly )

138
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:24,719
So, um...

139
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,754
wh-what do you do
these days?

140
00:08:30,526 --> 00:08:32,093
What do you mean?

141
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:36,965
Why don't I show you
around the house, Gordon?

142
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,572
<i>Lexie: Just because you've
got some fancy new title-</i>

143
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:46,440
assistant head ranger,

144
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:49,243
with special responsibilities
for guided tours!

145
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:51,880
Doesn't give you the right
to take food without asking.

146
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:54,248
I told you-
I didn't!

147
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:57,318
So that salmon just uncooked
itself, and swam away, did it?

148
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:59,521
<i>Golly: How long has
food been going missing?</i>

149
00:08:59,522 --> 00:09:00,955
A couple of days now.

150
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:05,627
And I know
this is premature...

151
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,795
but we may as well
get it out of the way.

152
00:09:07,796 --> 00:09:11,298
- I'd prefer July.
- But September would suit me better.

153
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:12,867
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

154
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:14,502
For a wedding.

155
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:15,770
For a-

156
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:19,206
just what is
going on here?

157
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:21,342
Your father says here
you'd be anxious

158
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:23,277
to do it before
the year is out.

159
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:34,455
Sorry, it's all
been a mistake.

160
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:35,723
Mistake?

161
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:37,859
I am not up for auction, thank you.

162
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:44,933
Goodbye.

163
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:47,068
Father!

164
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,209
Hector: I'm only trying to help!

165
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,344
A chap your age needs
a woman by his side!

166
00:09:57,345 --> 00:09:59,047
I have told you
countless times,

167
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:01,248
<i>when and indeed if
I decide to marry-</i>

168
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:03,517
- if?
- It will be to somebody I care about!

169
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:06,287
What about that Justine woman?
You were with her for years!

170
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:08,790
- You hated each other!
- I did not! She had a spark!

171
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,491
I admired that.
Wide enough hips.

172
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:12,093
Oh, so that's
what this is about!

173
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:15,162
Not my future bride,
but your future grandchild!

174
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:17,465
You have a responsibility
to your lineage!

175
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:19,734
Stay out of my private
life, do you hear?!

176
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,970
<i>If you don't,
I'll- I'll-</i>

177
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:24,338
- I'll have the snip!
- Snip?

178
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:27,041
I will have
my lineage cut off!

179
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,946
( laughs nervously )

180
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:44,058
Hector.

181
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:47,128
This house is tainted by a
lack of moral responsibility.

182
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:51,032
How nice to see
you too, Katrina.

183
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:55,770
<i>( car door shuts )</i>

184
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:09,316
Poor old Archie.

185
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,491
You don't have to have
time for dynasties,

186
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:21,228
but you must find
some time for yourself.

187
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:24,132
<i>Forget about this
place for five minutes.</i>

188
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:27,368
<i>What do they say
these days?</i>

189
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:28,936
Chill out?

190
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:32,874
While you're still young.

191
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,183
If money were no object,
what would you buy?

192
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,086
You know that.

193
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:47,755
I'd secure a future
for Glenbogle.

194
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:50,457
I don't mean that.
What would you buy for you?

195
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,229
Well, I've always
fancied a Porsche.

196
00:11:56,398 --> 00:11:58,032
Really?

197
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:59,801
Yeah, a red one.

198
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:08,976
Ahem-hem!
I'll need some help

199
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:11,779
to set up the beach
for the party.

200
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,081
Oh, sorry.

201
00:12:13,082 --> 00:12:16,317
I've got my assistant head
ranger duties to perform.

202
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,954
I've agreed to let Duncan take
our first group around the estate.

203
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:22,389
It'll be like
"The Blair Witch Project"

204
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,425
all over again.
( giggles )

205
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:25,960
Take no notice,
Duncan.

206
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:27,195
You'll be great.

207
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:29,731
Anyway, the teachers
will be with him.

208
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:31,498
- Teachers?
- Yep.

209
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:34,435
It's the kids from the school
you'll be showing round.

210
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:36,370
Did you say kid-

211
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,072
children?

212
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:40,574
15 sweet little
10-year-olds.

213
00:12:41,643 --> 00:12:43,945
It's a party
of children, Dunc,

214
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:45,646
not a party
of ax murderers.

215
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,683
( screams )

216
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:57,892
<i>Katrina: You know it
was a mistake, don't you?</i>

217
00:12:57,893 --> 00:12:59,693
The bank cocked up
the direct debits.

218
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:02,363
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry
about the threatening letter.

219
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,166
It goes out to any of the
tenants who get into arrears.

220
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:08,002
Just another one
of your tenants now, am I?

221
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:10,471
You know
I didn't mean...

222
00:13:10,472 --> 00:13:14,142
I gather Fergal's asked you to
bring the kids over tomorrow.

223
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:17,011
- It was my idea actually.
- Right.

224
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:19,613
It must be good having
someone like Fergal around.

225
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:23,550
<i>Really seems to know
how to make the place work.</i>

226
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:25,086
Certainly understands
people.

227
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:28,122
You included?

228
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:30,224
What goes on between me
and Fergal

229
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:32,593
is my business,
don't you think?

230
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:35,462
- You'd better come quick.
- What is it?

231
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:37,899
<i>There's one of your tenants
in my kitchen,</i>

232
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,434
saying that you chucked
him out into the street.

233
00:13:43,638 --> 00:13:45,807
At least you understand
responsibility.

234
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:47,308
Loyalty. Duty.

235
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:51,445
<i>( horn honking )</i>

236
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:56,583
<i>( vehicle approaching )</i>

237
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,958
Hector MacDonald?

238
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,026
Yes?

239
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:06,027
Kieran Conway.

240
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:07,494
We spoke
on the phone earlier.

241
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:09,697
Oh, yes.

242
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:12,133
I'm afraid you've had
a wasted journey.

243
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,767
This is my daughter Tanya.

244
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,207
Absolutely enchanted.

245
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:21,709
I'm sorry,
mister, um...

246
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,578
Tosh.
Tosh McKellan.

247
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:27,248
I don't understand what
you're talking about.

248
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:29,383
I have never evicted
any of my tenants.

249
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:32,987
- Not you. Your father.
- I might've known.

250
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:34,889
<i>Fergal: Evicted you from where?</i>

251
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,924
My cottage.
By the west wood.

252
00:14:36,925 --> 00:14:40,261
Is that one of the ones you've
been renting out to tourists?

253
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:42,230
<i>They've been vacant
for years.</i>

254
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:45,299
Sent me to a home.
I didn't want to go there!

255
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,602
Wanted to stay in the house
I lived in 46 years!

256
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:51,672
I am sorry, but you are going
to have to go back to the home.

257
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:53,207
I'll not go back there!

258
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:56,110
<i>You're the laird.
I am your responsibility.</i>

259
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:58,179
You can't stay here.

260
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,514
Archie, he can bunk
down with me tonight.

261
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:02,516
<i>We can just sort it out in the morning.</i>

262
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:04,485
Right, thanks.

263
00:15:05,954 --> 00:15:08,122
Arch, you're wanted.

264
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:09,323
Oh, now what?

265
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:11,292
- You've got guests.
- Guests!

266
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:13,327
An elderly gentleman,

267
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:16,063
and his young,
very unmarried daughter.

268
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:18,732
Right.

269
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:20,534
<i>( men laughing )</i>

270
00:15:20,535 --> 00:15:23,204
Sorry to disappoint, but
I am going to my room,

271
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:26,673
and I shall emerge sometime
after my 70th birthday.

272
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:28,910
You have had a wasted
journey, I'm afraid.

273
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:30,945
I told my father
of my intention

274
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:33,014
to take a lifetime vow of chastity

275
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,215
some months ago,

276
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:36,683
but he seems
to have forgotten!

277
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:39,020
Archie, may I introduce you
to the Earl of Nissalagh,

278
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,687
from the beautiful
Republic of Ireland?

279
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:42,056
Good night.

280
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:44,691
And may I introduce
my daughter,

281
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:45,793
Tanya?

282
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:01,742
Hello.

283
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,835
You got something
on your mind?

284
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:30,338
Oh, it's just...

285
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:31,973
these kids
coming tomorrow.

286
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:33,174
What?

287
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:34,675
Well...

288
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:36,543
you might find this
hard to believe,

289
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:39,046
me being a man
of the world and that,

290
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:41,748
but when I was a kid,
I was...

291
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:44,151
an object of fun
and ridicule.

292
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:46,787
Surely not.

293
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:49,390
Oh, yeah, yeah.

294
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:51,225
Butt of the jokes.

295
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:53,361
The guy that had
his bike stolen,

296
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:55,363
the itching powder
down his sports-

297
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:58,199
it's just 'cause I wanted
to learn stuff, you know.

298
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:00,401
I never...

299
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:04,571
I never had any friends.

300
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:08,142
<i>Hector:
No, no, I insist!</i>

301
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:09,343
You'll both
stay the night.

302
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:11,445
Well... that's
jolly decent of you.

303
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:13,214
Not at all.
Go through.

304
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,816
I'll get Lexie to take
the port to the library.

305
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:19,487
Going rather well,
don't you think?

306
00:17:19,488 --> 00:17:22,490
I thought Archie told you
to stop this skulduggery.

307
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:25,493
Listen, that chap has
a huge estate in Ireland.

308
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:27,261
Now, I don't want
to be vulgar,

309
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:29,997
but an alliance would solve
all our financial problems.

310
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:32,066
Hector, this isn't
the middle ages.

311
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:34,101
People don't marry
to secure dynasties

312
00:17:34,102 --> 00:17:35,936
and increase
their assets.

313
00:17:35,937 --> 00:17:38,005
Archie's got enough
on his plate

314
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:40,374
without worrying about
the precious family line.

315
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,310
Besides, you can't just throw
two people together like that!

316
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:46,113
- We were thrown together.
- Yes, and I wish I could say

317
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:47,915
that it was love
at first sight,

318
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,983
but it wasn't!
We grew together,

319
00:17:49,984 --> 00:17:52,053
and I learned
to know what a warm,

320
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:54,155
kindhearted,
wonderful man

321
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,956
that you are,
and then...

322
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:57,358
and only then,

323
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,027
did I fall deeply
in love with you.

324
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:01,995
Archie deserves
that chance.

325
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:05,066
<i>- ( laughter )
- ah.</i>

326
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:06,600
We thought
we'd go for a walk.

327
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:09,036
<i>- It's such a lovely night.
- Hector: yes.</i>

328
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:17,545
( humming wedding march )

329
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:23,750
This is stunning.

330
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:28,089
You're so lucky.

331
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,458
You must have views
like this at home.

332
00:18:31,826 --> 00:18:33,060
Yeah.

333
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:36,297
Yeah, but I never
have time to look.

334
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:38,865
Yep, I know
that feeling.

335
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:42,570
I hope you don't
mind me saying so,

336
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:44,205
but you...

337
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,807
you don't seem obvious laird material.

338
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:48,742
Well, I wasn't
supposed to be.

339
00:18:48,743 --> 00:18:51,545
I had an older brother,
Jamie. He died.

340
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:54,582
Oh. I'm sorry.

341
00:18:58,086 --> 00:19:01,722
I was kind of thrown into
this laird stuff.

342
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:05,292
Mostly I've been trying
to prove myself to my father.

343
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:09,163
What about you,
your old man the same?

344
00:19:09,164 --> 00:19:10,897
Yeah, I guess so.

345
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,602
I'm all he's got.

346
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:17,104
Well, you must have
more time on your hands

347
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:19,940
now that you've managed
to turn the estate around.

348
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,942
Yeah, true.

349
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:23,877
<i>It was tough,
though.</i>

350
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:27,080
Had to sell off
the family silver.

351
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:28,815
Tell me about it.

352
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:33,086
Of course, father made me
keep some stuff back,

353
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:35,022
things he could
never part with.

354
00:19:36,224 --> 00:19:37,891
Bet Hector did the same.

355
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:40,628
Well, if he has,
he's never told me about it.

356
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:44,131
The truth is,
we are stony broke.

357
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:50,037
- Broke?!
- Completely skint.

358
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:53,040
They're pinning all their
hopes on this visitor center.

359
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,575
Damn!

360
00:19:54,576 --> 00:19:56,810
<i>We'd best get out
of here first thing.</i>

361
00:19:56,811 --> 00:19:58,779
No. I have spent
a fortune on this,

362
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,081
hiring that car, the suit,
those diamonds-

363
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:03,317
I'm not leaving
without some compensation.

364
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,686
They haven't got anything
worth nicking, dad!

365
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:07,721
Don't you believe it.

366
00:20:07,722 --> 00:20:09,590
<i>Aristos always say
they're broke.</i>

367
00:20:09,591 --> 00:20:12,959
But they never mention the
Gainsborough stashed away in the attic.

368
00:20:14,362 --> 00:20:15,796
<i>Look,</i>

369
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,199
I'll work
on the old duffer tomorrow.

370
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:23,571
You charm the lad.

371
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:59,273
( slams )

372
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,718
Welcome to Glenbogle.

373
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:12,353
My name is...

374
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,454
Dunc.

375
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:16,390
I'm called...
I'm called Duncan,

376
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:19,059
and this place
is called Glenbogle.

377
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,395
So Archie doesn't know
about the party?

378
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:24,632
No, so whatever it takes, just
keep him away from the beach.

379
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:27,468
- How will I do that?
- You'll think of something.

380
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:29,270
<i>- Archie: gone?
- Fergal: yeah.</i>

381
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:32,606
He bedded down on my sofa last
night. This morning, no sign of him.

382
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:35,075
- Maybe he went back to the home?
- No chance.

383
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:37,043
We'll have to search
for him. Dunc?

384
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:39,680
Sorry, I've got to look
after the school kids.

385
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:41,482
I'll ask around.

386
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:43,150
Who's he?

387
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:44,618
Oh, don't you start.

388
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:49,490
They seem to be
getting on awfully well.

389
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:50,791
<i>Ha ha ha!</i>

390
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:52,293
Indeed.

391
00:21:52,294 --> 00:21:53,560
So...

392
00:21:53,561 --> 00:21:55,796
how many acres
do you have here?

393
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:57,798
About 38,500.

394
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:59,099
Ooh...

395
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,668
not a bad little plot.

396
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:01,802
Little? Ha ha!

397
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:03,937
How many acres do you have in Ireland?

398
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:06,407
Oh, give or take,
about... 50,000.

399
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,409
Excellent.
Excellent.

400
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,944
Still, this old pile of yours
is pretty impressive.

401
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:12,078
Yes, well...

402
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,214
it could do with a coat
of paint, I suppose.

403
00:22:14,215 --> 00:22:15,683
( both chuckling )

404
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:17,785
- You're not fooling anyone.
- I'm not?

405
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:21,087
Keep this place looking
rundown, scare away the taxman.

406
00:22:21,088 --> 00:22:22,423
Well...

407
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,091
still, it's always a
sign of true breeding,

408
00:22:25,092 --> 00:22:26,827
<i>keeping the really
expensive stuff</i>

409
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:29,262
under lock and key.
Most unostentatious.

410
00:22:29,263 --> 00:22:32,399
Well, never seen the need
to... flaunt one's wealth.

411
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,234
I've lots of antiques
hidden away.

412
00:22:34,235 --> 00:22:35,736
Really?

413
00:22:35,737 --> 00:22:36,837
Me too.

414
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:38,439
Oh, yes.

415
00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:43,109
( children stepping down )

416
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,411
Quickly now.

417
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,120
Right.

418
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:55,622
Well.

419
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:57,524
Over to you,
Duncan.

420
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:07,334
Welcome to Glenbogle.

421
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:09,370
<i>My name's Duncan,</i>

422
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:12,473
and I'm your show here
to guide you-

423
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,174
I mean,

424
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:16,042
I'm your guide here

425
00:23:16,043 --> 00:23:17,678
<i>to show you around</i>

426
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,881
this ancient and very...

427
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:22,549
old...

428
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:26,453
and beautiful estate.

429
00:23:30,057 --> 00:23:32,259
Let's get started.

430
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,194
I'll catch up
later.

431
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:39,833
Come on.

432
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:48,141
Maybe Fergal's
found him.

433
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,513
Hi.

434
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,180
Happy birthday.

435
00:23:54,181 --> 00:23:56,517
Thanks.

436
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,951
Hello.

437
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,221
Sorry. Katrina, this is Tanya.

438
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:03,056
Nice to meet you.

439
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:05,926
So, any special plans
for the big day?

440
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:08,128
Yes, we're playing
hide-and-seek

441
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:09,630
with an octogenarian
tenant.

442
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:11,932
<i>- What?
- Fergal: okay, I found Tosh.</i>

443
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:14,435
<i>- oh, good.
- Not good.</i>

444
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:19,773
<i>Fergal:
Sorry, Archie,</i>

445
00:24:19,774 --> 00:24:21,942
he must've nicked
the chain from my place.

446
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:24,478
I'll not budge till you
give me my cottage back!

447
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,680
Be reasonable.
You can't stay here.

448
00:24:26,681 --> 00:24:28,549
I claim
squatter's rights!

449
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,917
I'm calling
the police!

450
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:32,218
Katrina: He's your tenant,
your responsibility.

451
00:24:32,219 --> 00:24:34,154
He's got to go! The
contractor's been paid

452
00:24:34,155 --> 00:24:35,856
a fortune to sort
this place out!

453
00:24:35,857 --> 00:24:37,858
He's a person
with feelings.

454
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:40,060
I'm sure Archie's doing
what's best for the estate.

455
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,095
You'd know all
about that, would you?

456
00:24:42,096 --> 00:24:44,197
<i>Fergal:
Okay, come on, Tosh.</i>

457
00:24:44,198 --> 00:24:46,299
Let's talk
about this outside.

458
00:24:48,937 --> 00:24:50,671
I'll not budge

459
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:53,740
till you give me
my cottage back.

460
00:24:56,678 --> 00:24:58,712
( sloshing )

461
00:25:10,358 --> 00:25:11,959
<i>Hector: Kieran?</i>

462
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:17,698
<i>Kieran?</i>

463
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:18,966
<i>Where are you,
old chap?</i>

464
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:21,935
Ah, there you are,
old chap.

465
00:25:21,936 --> 00:25:24,371
What have you got there?
"Robert the Bruce. "

466
00:25:24,372 --> 00:25:25,672
Excellent.

467
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:37,985
Oh, Lexie!
Oh!

468
00:25:37,986 --> 00:25:39,019
Do you need a hand?

469
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,587
I need several pairs.

470
00:25:40,588 --> 00:25:42,455
Did you get
Archie's present?

471
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:45,926
Yes, red one. Pop up
headlights. The lot.

472
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:47,394
Mmm.

473
00:25:57,304 --> 00:25:58,972
Archie?

474
00:25:58,973 --> 00:26:02,142
They're gonna be on double
time in a couple hours.

475
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:04,711
Okay, okay.

476
00:26:04,712 --> 00:26:06,613
What are you
gonna do?

477
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,852
He'll have to come out
when he's hungry, won't he?

478
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:13,386
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

479
00:26:13,387 --> 00:26:15,121
He has to eat...

480
00:26:15,122 --> 00:26:17,691
here you are, Tosh.

481
00:26:19,293 --> 00:26:20,994
Excuse me.

482
00:26:20,995 --> 00:26:22,663
There's ham and cheese.

483
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,666
I didn't know whether you
took sugar, so I didn't stir.

484
00:26:27,134 --> 00:26:30,003
- She's very pretty.
- I'm sorry?

485
00:26:30,004 --> 00:26:33,139
<i>- Tanya: Katrina.
- How're you feeling?</i>

486
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,975
Yes, I suppose she is.

487
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:39,446
What's the story?

488
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:43,283
She's just another one
of my tenants.

489
00:26:51,358 --> 00:26:53,326
Duncan:
These trees are...

490
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:56,563
well, firs.

491
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:03,369
And these ones
over here are...

492
00:27:05,673 --> 00:27:07,774
firs, too.

493
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:10,777
Duncan, they've
seen trees before.

494
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:11,945
Right.

495
00:27:14,616 --> 00:27:17,851
One of the reasons that
this place is so important

496
00:27:17,852 --> 00:27:21,021
<i>is because...
of the amazing amount of...</i>

497
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:22,990
wildlife.

498
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:28,729
<i>You like animals,
right?</i>

499
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:36,870
- Yes?
- Is this forest natural?

500
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:39,640
Or has it been replanted
by the landowners?

501
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:41,174
Children:
Hmmm?

502
00:27:42,376 --> 00:27:44,444
This is mainly natural,

503
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:46,312
but if you like,
I can take you up

504
00:27:46,313 --> 00:27:47,814
to our new
replanting project.

505
00:27:47,815 --> 00:27:50,550
Children:
Nnnn...

506
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:52,085
Maybe not.

507
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:54,320
Bad idea.

508
00:27:54,321 --> 00:27:58,025
Right.
Let's have a break.

509
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:00,160
( children laughing,
talking )

510
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:06,366
They hate me.

511
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:09,069
Of course they do.
You're an adult.

512
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,638
You're doing fine.

513
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,893
That room's out of bounds,
I'm afraid, old chap.

514
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:34,695
Buried treasure, eh?

515
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:36,496
My late son's room.

516
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:38,231
Family only, I'm afraid.

517
00:28:38,232 --> 00:28:39,766
Come on over
to this music box.

518
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:41,234
It's over 100 years old.

519
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:45,038
( music box playing )

520
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:51,144
( children playing )

521
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:01,487
Okay,
my wee friends.

522
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:03,890
Time to go.

523
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:09,062
<i>Right!
Back in line now!</i>

524
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:15,702
Sometimes, they just need
to know who's boss.

525
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:32,119
Odd one out, eh?

526
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,754
What's your name?

527
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:35,521
Duncan.

528
00:29:37,424 --> 00:29:38,992
I'll die here.

529
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:40,861
I have had
enough of this.

530
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,230
My father would not
have kicked him out!

531
00:29:43,231 --> 00:29:46,599
That's what he did! I could still
have done a decent day's work.

532
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,969
You know
that's not true.

533
00:29:50,704 --> 00:29:53,673
You tell him
what really happened.

534
00:29:53,674 --> 00:29:55,541
I'll not budge.

535
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:57,310
What happened, Tosh?

536
00:30:00,481 --> 00:30:03,449
My Annie died,
that's what happened.

537
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,318
Annie?

538
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:07,053
Without her, I-

539
00:30:08,122 --> 00:30:11,457
I didn't cope so well.

540
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:14,861
The truth is
I went to pieces.

541
00:30:14,862 --> 00:30:17,998
I'd always had her
beside me, 40-odd years.

542
00:30:19,066 --> 00:30:20,801
But she went so sudden.

543
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:24,570
It was a bad time.

544
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:30,143
I stopped behaving
like a man.

545
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:32,846
Stopped looking
after meself.

546
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:35,816
Lost my self-respect.

547
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:38,451
<i>They packed me off
to that place.</i>

548
00:30:39,987 --> 00:30:42,388
But I'm stronger now.

549
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:44,958
I could do
a day's work.

550
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,930
I want my dignity back.

551
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,765
I want my home back.

552
00:31:00,975 --> 00:31:02,442
Thanks.

553
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,877
What for?

554
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:06,346
Asking a question
earlier.

555
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:08,414
That really helped
me out, that did.

556
00:31:08,415 --> 00:31:11,517
Girls think it isn't cool
if you ask questions.

557
00:31:11,518 --> 00:31:13,786
If you keep
asking questions,

558
00:31:13,787 --> 00:31:15,956
you become
really clever.

559
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,490
You could be a...

560
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,195
you could be a doctor
or an astronaut, maybe.

561
00:31:22,196 --> 00:31:24,731
Did you ask questions
at school?

562
00:31:24,732 --> 00:31:26,333
Well, I used to.

563
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:28,034
But the other kids,
they...

564
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:30,837
they put me off.
I wish they hadn't.

565
00:31:30,838 --> 00:31:33,439
I wish I'd kept
asking questions.

566
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,776
So you could've been
an astronaut?

567
00:31:36,777 --> 00:31:38,711
( laughs )
Aye.

568
00:31:38,712 --> 00:31:41,948
I think your job's
dead cool.

569
00:31:41,949 --> 00:31:43,449
Can I have
your autograph?

570
00:31:56,163 --> 00:31:59,099
Tosh, I would love
to help you, but...

571
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,601
I have other people
to think of.

572
00:32:01,602 --> 00:32:05,272
<i>Things have moved on since
you were a tenant here.</i>

573
00:32:05,273 --> 00:32:07,640
I wish I could
let you stay, but...

574
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:10,243
we just
can't afford it.

575
00:32:11,645 --> 00:32:13,746
There was a time
when this estate

576
00:32:13,747 --> 00:32:15,581
employed 100 workers
on the land,

577
00:32:15,582 --> 00:32:18,285
and 50 in the house,
but...

578
00:32:18,286 --> 00:32:20,153
well, now
we only have four.

579
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:22,222
If I don't balance
the books,

580
00:32:22,223 --> 00:32:24,624
and make this place
pay, then...

581
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:26,592
no one'll have
a home here.

582
00:32:26,593 --> 00:32:29,529
<i>No one.</i>

583
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,233
<i>I'm sorry, Tosh.
I can't help you.</i>

584
00:32:39,606 --> 00:32:43,944
It's called autumn days,

585
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:45,946
<i>the number's in the book.</i>

586
00:32:52,386 --> 00:32:54,687
Happy birthday to me.

587
00:33:10,904 --> 00:33:13,506
Golly, you've been
saying recently

588
00:33:13,507 --> 00:33:15,141
that you could do
with a hand.

589
00:33:15,142 --> 00:33:18,378
You know, odd jobs
from time to time.

590
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:20,981
What?

591
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:23,984
Oh, aye, aye.
That's right.

592
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:27,087
And I was wondering how much
the council are paying

593
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,555
to keep Tosh
at that home?

594
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:32,025
I could ask them
if they'd pay

595
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:34,361
for the cottage
instead.

596
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:36,129
Well done,
Archie.

597
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:41,267
Right. I think you can
move back into your cottage.

598
00:33:42,736 --> 00:33:44,037
Do you mean it?

599
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:45,338
Absolutely.

600
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:47,240
You'll not get it
for free, though.

601
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:49,009
Golly here
needs some help.

602
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,711
You're a top man, Archie.

603
00:33:51,712 --> 00:33:53,980
You're taking a risk,

604
00:33:53,981 --> 00:33:56,449
but I won't
let you down.

605
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:16,136
Tanya:
It just feels wrong.

606
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,905
These people,
they're up against it.

607
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:21,541
Archie has to make
this place work.

608
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:23,176
We've all got
to make a living.

609
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:27,514
It's not just
about the money, dad.

610
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:30,450
These are... decent folk.

611
00:34:30,451 --> 00:34:32,852
They support each other.
They rally round.

612
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:36,789
Has this young lad
turned your head, huh?

613
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,891
Listen, we might
never get a chance


614
00:34:38,892 --> 00:34:40,293
like this again.

615
00:34:40,294 --> 00:34:42,429
They'll all be at Archie's party later.

616
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,597
We'll grab what we can,
and then be gone

617
00:34:44,598 --> 00:34:47,133
before he blows
his candles out.

618
00:34:47,134 --> 00:34:49,335
I need your help,
darling.

619
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:50,770
Hi there.

620
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:53,473
Hi.

621
00:34:53,474 --> 00:34:55,641
Do you still want to see
around the place?

622
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:01,347
( children talking )

623
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,627
Don't let the dogs
eat the food.

624
00:35:21,668 --> 00:35:23,903
( lock turns )

625
00:36:06,046 --> 00:36:07,647
You're very quiet.

626
00:36:09,783 --> 00:36:12,885
That's the pot calling
the kettle black.

627
00:36:12,886 --> 00:36:14,720
Yeah, I suppose
you're right.

628
00:36:17,324 --> 00:36:21,327
Listen, thank you for
making my birthday...

629
00:36:21,328 --> 00:36:22,995
well, different.

630
00:36:22,996 --> 00:36:26,299
Before you say anything, there's
something you should know.

631
00:36:28,602 --> 00:36:30,436
It's about you and me.

632
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:35,941
It would never work.

633
00:36:35,942 --> 00:36:38,844
Funny, I was going
to say the same thing.

634
00:36:38,845 --> 00:36:42,348
I mean, you're... tied up
with running your estate,

635
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:44,850
and... I'm...

636
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:46,619
tied up with mine.

637
00:36:48,222 --> 00:36:50,356
I thought you
were going to say

638
00:36:50,357 --> 00:36:52,325
it was because
of Katrina.

639
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:01,834
Archie MacDonald, you're
crazy about that girl.

640
00:37:01,835 --> 00:37:03,836
What on earth
makes you say that?

641
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:10,743
Take it from someone
who knows.

642
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,516
Don't waste a chance
to be really happy

643
00:37:16,517 --> 00:37:17,983
with a good person.

644
00:37:19,453 --> 00:37:22,021
It doesn't happen
very often.

645
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:28,261
Tell me you're not
in love with her.

646
00:37:28,262 --> 00:37:31,997
- I, um-
- party guests: Surprise!

647
00:37:31,998 --> 00:37:34,100
# happy birthday
to you... #

648
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:35,635
oh, no!

649
00:37:35,636 --> 00:37:38,271
- Did you know about this?
- Yes.

650
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:41,407
So that's why you spent a day
with me, keep me off the trail.

651
00:37:41,408 --> 00:37:44,176
No, I spent the day with
you because I wanted to.

652
00:37:44,177 --> 00:37:48,180
# happy birthday
to you. #

653
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:50,015
thank you
very much.

654
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:58,124
<i>Duncan:
It'll be good fun.</i>

655
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:01,026
<i>You like parties,
don't you?</i>

656
00:38:01,027 --> 00:38:03,129
Wow...

657
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,897
is that the new series?

658
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:08,033
- Like cars, do you?
- Yeah.

659
00:38:08,034 --> 00:38:10,836
Uh-uh. That'll be
one of the guests'.

660
00:38:10,837 --> 00:38:13,239
Best not to touch.
Go to the party.

661
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,875
You said I should
ask questions.

662
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,278
Has it got a V-8 engine?

663
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:20,413
I don't suppose
it would do any harm

664
00:38:20,414 --> 00:38:22,282
to have a wee look.

665
00:38:22,283 --> 00:38:24,584
No touching, mind.

666
00:38:36,697 --> 00:38:38,364
<i>Lexie:
Enjoying yourself, Arch?</i>

667
00:38:38,365 --> 00:38:40,500
<i>Thank you so much.
Can't thank you enough.</i>

668
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:43,369
Cake's wonderful.

669
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:47,072
See? She's already part of the family.

670
00:38:47,073 --> 00:38:49,409
She's only been here
one day.

671
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,844
She looks pretty much
in there to me.

672
00:38:51,845 --> 00:38:54,347
But we all know
what a sucker Archie is

673
00:38:54,348 --> 00:38:56,215
for a pretty face, eh?

674
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:00,753
<i>Hector:
So, where's your father?</i>

675
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:02,655
Oh, he has
a slight headache.

676
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,357
He said
he'd join us later.

677
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:05,525
Splendid.
Well...

678
00:39:05,526 --> 00:39:07,527
here's to new beginnings, eh?

679
00:39:07,528 --> 00:39:08,695
New beginnings.

680
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:11,364
I know you didn't want
a fuss, Archie,

681
00:39:11,365 --> 00:39:14,233
but I couldn't help thinking
about the past. Remember?

682
00:39:14,234 --> 00:39:17,036
All the parties here,
children, Lizzie...

683
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:19,439
Jamie would've
loved this.

684
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,741
I don't think
you realise, Archie,

685
00:39:21,742 --> 00:39:24,310
how lucky and proud
I feel to have you,

686
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:25,845
birthday boy.

687
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:27,680
Thank you very much,
mother.

688
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,394
( playing with controls )

689
00:39:41,395 --> 00:39:43,830
Might've one of these
myself one day.

690
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:47,299
I'm sure a bright lad like you
will be able to have one too.

691
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,470
Oh, don't touch that!
That's the ejector button!

692
00:39:52,105 --> 00:39:53,973
( playing with buttons )

693
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:08,388
You scared the wits
out of me!

694
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:10,623
Have you no shame?

695
00:40:10,624 --> 00:40:13,259
- I can't afford shame.
- This is wrong!

696
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,761
Look, the lad's dead.

697
00:40:14,762 --> 00:40:16,596
He has no use
for this stuff.

698
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:18,531
These trophies
aren't worth much.

699
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:24,771
This is more like it.

700
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:26,939
I have done my best
for you for 10 years,

701
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,410
<i>but I can't let you
do this!</i>

702
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:32,344
Look at you, dad.

703
00:40:33,847 --> 00:40:35,648
Look at what
you've become.

704
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,986
Oh, thanks, Lexie.

705
00:40:55,168 --> 00:40:58,671
Just tell me you're not
seriously thinking about it.

706
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:00,272
About what?

707
00:41:00,273 --> 00:41:01,874
Come on.

708
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,509
Arranged marriages.

709
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,412
You don't really believe
in all that stuff, do you?

710
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:08,614
I've only just met her.

711
00:41:08,615 --> 00:41:10,917
For what it's worth,
I think she's all right.

712
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:14,420
All right?

713
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:19,124
And besides, whatever goes
on between me and Tanya,

714
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:22,027
or anyone else, for that
matter, is my business.

715
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:27,533
It's always been
the same, hasn't it?

716
00:41:27,534 --> 00:41:30,336
"You wouldn't let your old
man down now, would you?

717
00:41:30,337 --> 00:41:32,638
Just one more job and I'll be set
- " please!

718
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:35,708
Let's just go! We
can't take any of this!

719
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:37,944
It's too late!

720
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,328
<i>Kieran:
Get away from my car.</i>

721
00:41:56,329 --> 00:41:58,531
What's going on?

722
00:42:14,314 --> 00:42:16,448
Kieran:
Get away! Get away!

723
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:17,917
Get away from my car!

724
00:42:17,918 --> 00:42:22,054
( honking )

725
00:42:22,055 --> 00:42:23,623
<i>( distant honking )</i>

726
00:42:36,236 --> 00:42:38,103
( dogs barking )

727
00:42:51,618 --> 00:42:53,553
Where are you
going, dad?

728
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,725
Where are you
running to now?

729
00:43:04,497 --> 00:43:06,465
What's going on,
old chap?


730
00:43:22,015 --> 00:43:23,883
( yelling )

731
00:43:37,965 --> 00:43:39,999
A real bright spot
that lad.

732
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,901
Takes one to know one.

733
00:43:43,837 --> 00:43:46,005
Come on,
the party's over.

734
00:43:52,112 --> 00:43:54,146
<i>( van leaving )</i>

735
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:49,869
I tried to tell you.

736
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,436
Before the party.

737
00:44:51,437 --> 00:44:53,438
Yeah, I know.

738
00:44:53,439 --> 00:44:54,974
Why?

739
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,311
Because, believe it or
not, I really like you.

740
00:45:01,048 --> 00:45:02,915
<i>I like all of you.</i>

741
00:45:06,586 --> 00:45:08,921
<i>He is my father,
Archie.</i>

742
00:45:08,922 --> 00:45:11,991
It's the family business.
You understand that.

743
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:14,660
Trying to make the family
business work, don't you?

744
00:45:15,729 --> 00:45:17,429
I'm gonna have
to call the police.

745
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:19,065
It's all right, Archie.

746
00:45:21,401 --> 00:45:22,902
Let them go.

747
00:45:22,903 --> 00:45:26,138
<i>We've been disturbed enough
by you people.</i>

748
00:45:26,139 --> 00:45:28,074
Jamie's been
disturbed enough.

749
00:45:28,075 --> 00:45:29,842
Thank you,
Mr. MacDonald.

750
00:45:34,981 --> 00:45:36,982
Thank you, Archie.

751
00:45:46,492 --> 00:45:49,762
- Archie...
- don't gloat.

752
00:45:49,763 --> 00:45:51,764
I'm not!

753
00:45:51,765 --> 00:45:53,833
That man is impossible!

754
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,214
- You all right, father?
- I'm fine.

755
00:46:08,215 --> 00:46:10,282
I'm sorry your party
was spoiled.

756
00:46:10,283 --> 00:46:13,518
At least that's my birthday
over for another year.

757
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:15,621
Ho ho.
Not quite.

758
00:46:16,757 --> 00:46:18,490
<i>Molly:
This is to remind you</i>

759
00:46:18,491 --> 00:46:20,492
<i>that you were once
a little boy,</i>

760
00:46:20,493 --> 00:46:21,794
<i>my little boy.</i>

761
00:46:21,795 --> 00:46:25,831
<i>Your very own
red Porsche.</i>

762
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:30,236
Couldn't afford
the real thing.

763
00:46:30,237 --> 00:46:32,004
Oh, mother,
it's perfect.

764
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,375
<i>Hector:
I'm sorry I interfered.</i>

765
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,277
I wish you all the luck
in the world.

766
00:46:38,278 --> 00:46:39,711
I hope you
find someone

767
00:46:39,712 --> 00:46:42,481
who makes you as happy
as your mother makes me.

768
00:46:42,482 --> 00:46:44,383
Thank you.

769
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:52,591
I was just trying
to tell him

770
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:56,095
that I was sorry things
didn't work out with Tanya,

771
00:46:56,096 --> 00:46:57,763
but he wouldn't listen.

772
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,202
What's so funny?

773
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,405
Just you and Archie.

774
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,607
Always seem to be
upsetting each other.

775
00:47:11,377 --> 00:47:12,845
Yeah.
Well...

776
00:47:14,214 --> 00:47:16,515
he can be a very
upsetting person.

777
00:47:18,218 --> 00:47:19,952
<i>Lexie: ready...</i>

778
00:47:19,953 --> 00:47:21,687
<i>steady...</i>

779
00:47:21,688 --> 00:47:22,788
<i>go!</i>

780
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:23,956
And they're off!

781
00:47:23,957 --> 00:47:25,825
And he's off!
Can you believe it?

782
00:47:25,826 --> 00:47:27,326
( yelling )

783
00:47:27,327 --> 00:47:29,028
He's round the tunnel,

784
00:47:29,029 --> 00:47:30,129
<i>he's in the tunnel...</i>

785
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,430
<i>and it's
over the hill.</i>

786
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,866
<i>( yelling; chattering )</i>

787
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,410
I better go.

788
00:47:50,317 --> 00:47:52,451
I'll see you soon.

789
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:11,337
