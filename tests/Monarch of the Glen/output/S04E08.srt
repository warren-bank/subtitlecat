2
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,113
I can feel a presence.

3
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:17,349
That would be Duncan.
He's outside the door.

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,784
And he's supposed
to be fixing the generator,

5
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:22,720
<i>- not earwigging on his Auntie Liz.
- Duncan: all right, Lex.</i>

6
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:26,425
It was very sweet of him
to arrange this for me.

7
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,127
You really shouldn't have put
yourself to all this trouble.

8
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:30,762
No trouble.

9
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:33,631
A wedding anniversary
is a wedding anniversary,

10
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:35,934
in this world
and the next.

11
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:38,437
Hector was never very good
at things like anniversaries.

12
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,505
Try calling him.

13
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:42,707
He wasn't much good
at listening, either.

14
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,077
We've made contact.

15
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:48,046
S...

16
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,449
O...

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,650
A...

18
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:54,786
P.

19
00:00:54,787 --> 00:00:56,788
Does that mean
something to you?

20
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,790
<i>( Lexie giggling )</i>

21
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:01,226
Sorry, that was me.
Shopping list.

22
00:01:02,828 --> 00:01:04,729
Oh thanks, Duncan.

23
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,832
Hector MacDonald,
are you there?

24
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:11,869
Probably gone fishing
or something.

25
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,739
No, no, there's someone
trying to get through.

26
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,909
He has a message,
an urgent message.

27
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,078
A warning.

28
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,280
<i>( rattling )</i>

29
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:31,223
What is it?

30
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,360
I don't know.

31
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,028
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

32
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:15,467
Archie?

<i>( door closes )</i>

34
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:21,139
Archie?

35
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:25,510
- Hi.
- ( gasps )

36
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:27,112
Was that just you there?

37
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,214
No, this is me.
Why, what's wrong?

38
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,782
I've just got
this feeling that some-

39
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:34,719
oh, nothing. Why are
you not in the office?

40
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,887
Well, I thought I'd take
a couple of days off.

41
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:39,023
Ooh, what's brought
this on?

42
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:41,192
Well, the death duties
are paid,

43
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:44,395
the wolf park's doing okay, we all
seem to be talking to one another.

44
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:46,131
There's not a cloud
on the horizon.

45
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,233
So... what are we
gonna do then?

46
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,201
Come and see.

47
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:56,407
Jamie's room?

48
00:02:56,408 --> 00:02:58,643
Yeah, we did the right
thing clearing it,

49
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:00,311
but we can't leave
it like this.

50
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:02,980
It's neither one thing nor the
other. I want to redecorate.

51
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:05,183
Archie, we can't afford
decorators just now.

52
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,485
No, I'll do it myself.

53
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:10,488
- ( laughs ) you?
- Any objections?

54
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,024
You don't know your Artex
from your elbow.

55
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:15,826
- Thank you.
- And what about the estate?

56
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:18,496
And the village art show?
They don't run by themselves.

57
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:21,299
Well, I had hoped that my
beautiful and talented wife

58
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,934
might do that. This'll
only take a couple of days.

59
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:26,871
And the rest. And you can't have
Duncan and Golly to help you.

60
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:29,174
- I'll need them.
- No, I'll do it on my own.

61
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,842
There is no way that
you're gonna be able

62
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:33,844
to decorate this
without any help.

63
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:35,713
I'd put money
on it.

64
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:37,549
All right,
you're on.

65
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,219
Let's say dinner for two at a
restaurant of the winner's choice.

66
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,155
I'll start looking
at the good food guide.

67
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:46,123
Okay.

68
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:51,062
You don't have
to run away.

69
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:53,164
I'm-
I'm not.

70
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:55,300
Yes, you are, and you have
been for the last week.

71
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,967
If you'd give me
a chance to explain.

72
00:03:56,968 --> 00:03:59,970
What is there to explain? My
so-called girlfriend's pregnant

73
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:02,907
and won't tell me who the father
is. Seems pretty clear to me.

74
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:04,676
Duncan, I understand
how you feel.

75
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,245
Oh, do you? that's good,
because I don't.

76
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:10,615
In fact, right now, I have
absolutely no idea how I feel.

77
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:13,551
All I know is that I don't even
want to be in the same room as you.

78
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:15,520
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,889
Are you all right?

80
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,058
I'm gonna be sick, so
unless you want to watch...

81
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,027
morning.

82
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,398
I'm sorry if I've
interrupted something.

83
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,267
No, you're
all right, Golly,

84
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:31,636
we're finished.

85
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,776
- What are you doing?
- Tidying up.

86
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:40,978
Your painting things.

87
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,080
I haven't managed
to finish a single thing

88
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:45,015
since I did that portrait
of your father.

89
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:47,719
So I'm hanging up
my brushes

90
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,121
and turning in
my turpentine.

91
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:52,557
You can't give up painting.
You've always loved it.

92
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,293
I'm not giving up painting.
Painting's giving up me.

93
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:58,329
I sometimes think I only did
it to get away from your father.

94
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,598
No need to do that now.

95
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:03,534
What about the art competition?
you've entered that for years.

96
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:05,470
There'll be plenty
of entries without mine.

97
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,072
Did you want something?

98
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:11,542
Oh, yeah, I wondered if you
might go and see Andrew Booth.

99
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:13,278
<i>You know, welcome him
to Glenbogle.</i>

100
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,248
I'd go myself but I'm
gonna be busy redecorating.

101
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:19,116
Redecorating?

102
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:21,452
Are you sure that's
a good idea?

103
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:28,659
Oh, hi, Lexie.

104
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,796
- Have you got a minute?
- Uh-huh, come in.

105
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:35,032
- That was some show.
- Sorry?

106
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:37,702
That banging outside the
window, it was quite scary.

107
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:39,937
How did you do that?

108
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:42,607
How did I do what?

109
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,576
You know,
the flash of light.

110
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,978
I'm sure that I saw someone
or something out there.

111
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,515
So there was a ghost.
Oh, Lexie.

112
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,184
There are no ghosts
at Glenbogle.

113
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:55,753
Have you never heard
of Robert MacDonald?

114
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:58,789
Yeah, but that was a story
just made up for the tourists.

115
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,193
The ghost of the first laird
always appears

116
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,996
at times of trouble
for the family.

117
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,099
So where has he been
for the past few years?

118
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,968
- Do you not know the story?
- No.

119
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:14,572
Robert MacDonald married
a serving girl, Mhari,

120
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:16,574
who worked
for the family.

121
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,944
A year and a day later
he disappeared.

122
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:23,848
All his young bride found
was a charred corpse.

123
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,350
You're making this up.

124
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:28,486
No, I've a book somewhere
that tells you all about it.

125
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:30,955
<i>I'll lend it to you
if you like.</i>

126
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:34,492
Oh, Lexie, would you
do me a favor?

127
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:38,596
I'm secretary for the Highland
Spiritualist and Clairvoyant Circle.

128
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:40,865
<i>I'm up for re-election,</i>

129
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:44,669
and if I could just show
the girls Robert MacDonald...

130
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,737
okay, okay, why not?

131
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:49,106
Bring them round for
dinner tomorrow night.

132
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:51,543
Oh, thanks.

133
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:57,415
Oh, I'm sorry.

134
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:00,918
Sorry.

135
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,488
Is anyone actually
serving here?

136
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,823
Gordon runs
the post office as well,

137
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:08,193
so you never can tell.

138
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,861
We haven't met,
I'm Archie MacDonald.

139
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:13,130
Andrew Booth,

140
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:15,500
pleased to meet you.

141
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:18,436
You must be the one who's
moved into Golly's croft.

142
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:22,006
You've probably no idea how much
of a favor you've done us all.

143
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:24,342
- Really?
- Mmm.

144
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,711
I hope you'll be throwing
yourself into village life.

145
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,879
Come to the art show-
my family organizes it.

146
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,815
Might even enter it.

147
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,417
<i>Oh, really?
Are you an artist?</i>

148
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,785
No, enthusiastic amateur.

149
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:37,955
You must enter it. There's
no shortage of space.

150
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:40,191
- I'll get you the details.
- Thanks.

151
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:42,427
And if there's anything
else we can do just ask.

152
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:46,130
There is one thing. I'm looking for
someone to do some cleaning for me.

153
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:48,433
Duncan- he works
on the estate-

154
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,468
his aunt sometimes
does some cleaning.

155
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:53,070
- I'll get her to come and see you.
- Thanks.

156
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,806
Morning, Gordon.

157
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:57,775
<i>( car horn honking )</i>

158
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:05,516
Oh, he runs
the garage as well.

159
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:15,826
If you're looking
for the walking trail

160
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:17,662
<i>you're in the wrong
direction.</i>

161
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,664
Oh, you're joking,
aren't you?

162
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,199
- Back that way is it?
- It is.

163
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,802
I'm only trying to get
a shot of a waterfall.

164
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:27,204
I work for a postcard
company

165
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:31,442
and I'm putting together this
new Highlands Collection for them.

166
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:34,679
If you're interested in giving us a
hand, there's a drink in it for you.

167
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,547
I've already got a job,
thank you.

168
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:38,616
You don't work
at Glenbogle House, do you?

169
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:41,653
- What's it to you?
- I want to get some pictures there.

170
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,555
Ah, well, you need to speak
to the estate office for that.

171
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:47,292
Oh, right, that'll be
Irene Stuart, isn't it?

172
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,527
No, it isn't.
It's Archie MacDonald.

173
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:51,929
You sure? I spoke to
a guy in the village

174
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,898
and he gave us
Irene's name.

175
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,502
Oh, well,
my mistake, eh?

176
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:02,139
Found a fella looking
over the loch today.

177
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,675
Mm-hmm.

178
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,677
Said he
was a photographer.

179
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,646
That someone had given him
your name as a contact here.

180
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:11,716
- Why would they do that?
- You tell me.

181
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,718
What's he look like?

182
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,753
About 40,
dark gray hair,

183
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:18,289
pretty good looking
I suppose, Glasgow accent.

184
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,725
- You sure?
- Somebody you know?

185
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,795
No, no, it was probably
a mistake.

186
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,431
Yeah, yeah,
that's what he said.

187
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,200
So there's no reason why somebody
should be looking for you?

188
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:32,203
- No, of course not.
- So what's wrong?

189
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,239
I just haven't been feeling
too well, that's all.

190
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,241
Ah.

191
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:40,345
Sorry to hear that.

192
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,714
Well, I hope you'll
be feeling better soon.

193
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,849
Thanks.

194
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:53,824
You're not allowed
to interrupt.

195
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,960
I've just come in to see
how you were getting on.

196
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:58,962
Lex, you're in the way.

197
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:00,864
Did you choose
the wallpaper?

198
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:03,066
- It's over there.
- Let's see.

199
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:09,807
( laughing )
What's this?

200
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:11,709
Sheep.

201
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,312
And who'll be sleeping
in here? Little Bo Peep?

202
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,681
This has always been a child's
bedroom, it's tradition.

203
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:19,784
You must know
something I don't.

204
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,652
No, but if this is going
to be the nursery

205
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:23,521
we'll need to redecorate
sooner or later.

206
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,557
And I don't get
any say in this?

207
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:28,693
What, you don't
like sheep?

208
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,594
I don't have
a problem with sheep.

209
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:32,996
- It's you, getting all broody on me.
- I am not.

210
00:10:32,997 --> 00:10:36,701
Right, so why else do you spend the
only time that you've had off in months

211
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,436
<i>building
a wee nest?</i>

212
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,239
Fine, don't tell
me then.

213
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,643
I want this to stop
being Jamie's old room.

214
00:10:48,146 --> 00:10:51,549
I suppose this is one
way of doing it.

215
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,585
And besides, we're bound to
have children sooner or later.

216
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:56,654
Well, later
would do me.

217
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:59,156
I'm not in any rush.

218
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:01,826
I guess I always thought
that once we were married,

219
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,861
then maybe we'd be ready.

220
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:05,996
You might be.

221
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:08,833
Just don't go ordering
any cot just yet.

222
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,176
<i>( thumping )</i>

223
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:49,273
Hi. come in.

224
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:54,445
I'm Molly MacDonald,
I'm your neighbor.

225
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:57,114
You must be Mrs. Booth.

226
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:59,417
Oh, no, Andrew's
in the bedroom.

227
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,152
Maybe this isn't
a good time.

228
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:03,788
No, no, it's okay.

229
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,689
<i>- Andrew!
- ( water running )</i>

230
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,325
He's washing,
he got ever so dirty.

231
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:11,862
Oh! I'll come
back later.

232
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:13,597
Andrew, how do you
want me?

233
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:19,637
Are you all right
with that?

234
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,005
I've just got to move it
so I can paper behind it.

235
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:23,674
Do you want me
to give you a hand?

236
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:26,811
No, no. I told Lexie I'd do
all the decorating by myself.

237
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,913
That's not decorating,
son, that's plumbing.

238
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:32,382
Are you sure you
don't want me to help?

239
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,453
No thank you. I want to prove to Lexie

240
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,321
that I'm not
completely useless

241
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:39,890
when it comes to doing
something practical.

242
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,266
I think you'd
better go

243
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:51,201
and turn the water
off then.

244
00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:53,671
Yes.

245
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:59,577
- How's it going?
- Great.

246
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,245
Are you managing
all right by yourself?

247
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:04,482
Yeah, no problem.

248
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,217
Yeah, little accident.

249
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:09,820
Oh, I do have
one request.

250
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:12,022
Could you paint
"Wayne" on the door?

251
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:13,557
Why?

252
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:15,258
You get
to choose the wallpaper,

253
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:17,327
so I get to choose
our baby's name.

254
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:19,363
Wayne?

255
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:22,432
And if it's a girl, then we
can cross out the W and put J.

256
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:25,503
You know, it'll be dead classy.
It'll be like Jayne with a Y.

257
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:28,739
Oh, listen, and while you're at it,
could you decorate a few more rooms?

258
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,042
I mean, why stop at one kid? I'm
thinking more seven, eight, or-

259
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:34,011
<i>( thumping )</i>

260
00:13:34,012 --> 00:13:35,546
What was that?

261
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:37,080
I thought
I heard someone.

262
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:39,116
Maybe it's the ghost
of Glenbogle.

263
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:40,651
Forget it.

264
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:43,353
I wish I could, but Duncan's
aunt gets out her Ouija board

265
00:13:43,354 --> 00:13:46,289
and all of a sudden we're in the
middle of the Blair Witch Project.

266
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,826
- Okay, okay, there's no one there.
- Thank you.

267
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,730
I met Andrew Booth
earlier.

268
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,899
I thought we should
invite him over to dinner.

269
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,501
I'll be busy of course,
but you could look after him.

270
00:13:57,502 --> 00:13:59,737
Are you going to invite
his little friend?

271
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,605
Golly thought he seemed
to be on his own.

272
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:03,373
Not if you count
nubile brunettes.

273
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:05,809
Oh, Archie, she could sit beside you,

274
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,445
you could talk
about sheepy wallpaper.

275
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:10,447
You mean you haven't
actually met him?

276
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:13,450
No. he was
otherwise engaged.

277
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:15,452
You know, if it wasn't
for him and Golly,

278
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:17,287
then we could have
lost everything.

279
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:19,456
Fine, if you really
think it's that important,

280
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:21,191
I'll go and see
him tomorrow.

281
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:23,093
Unless you'd rather
I went tonight?

282
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,931
Before you start, there's
something I'd like to say

283
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,099
and I'd prefer to tell you
all together.

284
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,334
Some of you do know
this already but...

285
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:34,304
I'm having a baby.

286
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:36,073
I've thought
things through

287
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:38,776
and I think it's best all round
if I leave here.

288
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:42,646
<i>I'd like to do that
as soon as possible.</i>

289
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:45,148
Enjoy your meal.

290
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,721
This is crazy.
If you and Irene

291
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:52,790
are having a baby
we should be celebrating.

292
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,694
- It's not Duncan's.
- Oh. right.

293
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,230
Thanks for that.
What was that all about?

294
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:02,432
They're my employers.
They've got a right to know.

295
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,868
How can you let them know
when you don't know yourself?

296
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:08,338
I do, I've made a decision.
I know what I'm doing.

297
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,674
<i>- But you can't leave.
- I can.</i>

298
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:13,877
The baby's father, he's coming to
look for me. I'm not ready to see him.

299
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:16,814
That's running away. If you're
not interested in this guy anymore,

300
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,382
- why don't you just tell him?
- It's not as easy as that.

301
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:21,485
Ah, so maybe you
are still interested.

302
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:24,989
I'm sorry, I should have told you first.
but we can't go on like this, can we?

303
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,857
No.

304
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:31,561
So that's it.

305
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:39,937
Good night, Irene.

306
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,384
So what are you
celebrating?

307
00:15:54,385 --> 00:15:56,353
Life being so great.

308
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:59,456
I know what you mean. I haven't worked in six months
- still.

309
00:15:59,457 --> 00:16:01,191
What is it you do?

310
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:04,461
- I'm the red danger.
- Eh?

311
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:06,563
I'm the head ranger.

312
00:16:06,564 --> 00:16:08,498
Oh, yeah, and where
do you do that then?

313
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:10,734
At Glenbogle.

314
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:13,070
Irene Stuart works
there, doesn't she?

315
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:15,072
How's she doing? I
haven't seen her in ages.

316
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:18,508
- You know Irene?
- Oh yes, we go way back.

317
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:22,780
So why are you
here now?

318
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,782
Kind of personal,
you know?

319
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,750
Look, I'll get you
another drink.

320
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:31,121
Hang on!

321
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:34,257
You turn up, and Irene
says she's leaving.

322
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:36,459
Oh, I get
the picture, pal!

323
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,809
How did I get here?

324
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,912
How do you think? I scraped
you up off the floor.

325
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,914
I'm not hungry.

326
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,882
Put it on the bruise.

327
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:03,353
( moaning )

328
00:17:04,956 --> 00:17:07,524
<i>- How are you feeling?
- Stupid.</i>

329
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:09,727
Well, it wasn't exactly
your finest hour.

330
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,528
Anything we can do
to help?

331
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,031
I don't want help.

332
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:16,700
I want some people
to show some respect.

333
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:19,103
- We do that.
- Irene?

334
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,606
She does, too. She's just trying
to not make things worse for you.

335
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:24,574
She's going away
with that bloke.

336
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:28,078
No, no, no she's going to her
parents. That's what she told us.

337
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,380
I don't want her
to go anywhere.

338
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:32,249
I know, Dunc.

339
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,284
Why's she going?

340
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:37,254
Maybe she doesn't want to
bring up a baby on her own.

341
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:40,624
<i>It's gonna be hard enough for
the kid not having a father.</i>

342
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:53,770
( door latch rattles )

343
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,675
Archie?

344
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:00,443
<i>( crashing )</i>

345
00:18:00,444 --> 00:18:02,412
Archie?

346
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:25,869
( electricity buzzing )

347
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:51,328
- What're you doing?
- ( gasps )

348
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:53,997
The stag's head
fell off the wall.

349
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:56,733
Well, you probably banged the
bedroom door once too often.

350
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:59,569
- Why are you not in bed?
- I had to finish the undercoat.

351
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,238
It's the middle
of the night.

352
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,273
I was getting
behind schedule.

353
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:06,543
Look. Where did they come from?

354
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:09,046
I probably walked through
some plaster or something.

355
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,448
But they stop
dead here.

356
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:13,583
You don't think
that's odd?

357
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:16,286
No, I think it's a couple of
minutes work with the hoover.

358
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:18,688
Archie, something's
going on.

359
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:20,757
Something weird.

360
00:19:20,758 --> 00:19:22,459
Yes, it's the middle
of the night,

361
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,894
we're standing in the hall
talking about stag's heads

362
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:27,497
and dust on the carpet.
Let's go to bed.

363
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:39,742
<i>You know all of this
hearing things?</i>

364
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:41,744
<i>Maybe you're
imagining it</i>

365
00:19:41,745 --> 00:19:43,780
because you're upset.

366
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:45,415
Why would I be upset?

367
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,584
Because of what we were
talking about earlier.

368
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:49,486
I mean, children.

369
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,857
I'm sorry, but I thought it was
something that we both wanted.

370
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:55,492
Yeah, it is.

371
00:19:58,129 --> 00:20:00,697
From as early
as I can remember,

372
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:02,532
I grew up with
my mother telling me

373
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:05,369
about all the things
I stopped her from doing.

374
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,271
I know she loved me
in her own way but...

375
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:13,143
I knew she resented me being
there almost just as much.

376
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:19,816
I want to choose
when I'm ready.

377
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:22,519
Okay.

378
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,368
I brought you some tea.

379
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:44,541
So... what was
the fight about?

380
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:49,879
You. it was your ex.

381
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,216
What did he say?

382
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:55,018
I can't remember.

383
00:20:56,854 --> 00:20:59,022
Do you know something?

384
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:02,659
You're the first man ever
to get into a fight over me.

385
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:06,530
I would anytime.

386
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,032
<i>- What, so you can get beaten up?
- no.</i>

387
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:11,601
So we could be together.

388
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:15,905
I love you, Irene.

389
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:18,375
Duncan, you know
I have to go.

390
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:21,478
You don't. You don't have
to keep on running away.

391
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:24,047
<i>You could stay
and have the baby here,</i>

392
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:26,983
and I could be the dad.

393
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:29,886
We're great together,
it'd work.

394
00:21:29,887 --> 00:21:32,355
I don't know
what to say.

395
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,628
Well, you don't have
to say yes just now,

396
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:40,297
but you could just think
about it.

397
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:43,266
I will.
I promise.

398
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,543
By the way,
I'm Molly.

399
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:55,712
Yes, Archie told me
all about you.

400
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:57,647
Pleased to meet you.
Come in, come in.

401
00:21:57,648 --> 00:21:59,316
You've got quite
a lot to sort out.

402
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,218
Well, it'll be easier
now you're here.

403
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,553
Could you unpack those,
put them on that shelf?

404
00:22:03,554 --> 00:22:05,522
Oh, is this
your daughter?

405
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:07,357
No, that's my wife.

406
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:08,858
She'll be joining
you here?

407
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:11,561
I shouldn't think so,
she died five years ago.

408
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:15,132
Oh, these must be
your children.

409
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:18,168
- Yes, some of them.
- How many have you got?

410
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:21,371
Four or five. Look, perhaps
it's best if I did this.

411
00:22:21,372 --> 00:22:23,673
Perhaps you could make
a start on the bathroom.

412
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:26,075
I'm afraid it's in
a terrible state.

413
00:22:26,076 --> 00:22:28,077
You want me to clean
the bathroom?

414
00:22:28,078 --> 00:22:30,147
No, I want you
to do the whole house.

415
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:33,150
We should talk about terms. I
could offer you four pounds an hour.

416
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,585
I've got to dash now, I'll
pay you when I come back

417
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:37,521
and then we'll talk
about references, okay?

418
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,656
Good, thank you.
I'll see you later.

419
00:22:46,063 --> 00:22:48,398
- From Golly.
- Thank you.

420
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:50,400
Do you want
a hand in here?

421
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:52,169
No, no. No need.

422
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,504
Have you got time?

423
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:57,407
Well, Lexie wants me
to set up the art show

424
00:22:57,408 --> 00:23:00,877
but she's not here,
so I don't have to.

425
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:03,513
How do you fancy
a spot of redecorating?

426
00:23:03,514 --> 00:23:05,182
Lexie, she doesn't
need to know.

427
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,250
- Okay.
- Great.

428
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:09,452
<i>- So how are you feeling?
- great.</i>

429
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:11,454
You know, what you
said last night

430
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:13,856
about Irene not wanting to
bring up the baby on her own?

431
00:23:13,857 --> 00:23:17,160
You were right. I talked to
her, so I'm gonna be the father.

432
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:18,461
Oh, great,
so she's staying?

433
00:23:18,462 --> 00:23:20,330
I've been thinking
about it all morning.

434
00:23:20,331 --> 00:23:22,332
I think I'd be
a fantastic dad.

435
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,067
<i>Good at all
the important things.</i>

436
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:26,903
You know, pulling faces,
comics and-

437
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:28,938
so Irene
is definitely staying?

438
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:30,873
That's not what
she said last night.

439
00:23:30,874 --> 00:23:34,444
Oh yeah, yeah, definitely
thinking about it.

440
00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:38,281
I mean, why would she
not want to stay?

441
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:40,650
It's a great place
to bring up a kid.

442
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:42,219
Yeah, it's pretty good,
yeah.

443
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,954
How many
- how many people have you told about this?

444
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:47,657
You, Auntie Liz.

445
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:49,759
If I were you, I wouldn't
tell too many more

446
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,695
until it's a little bit
more definite.

447
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,930
Oh, it's definite.

448
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:56,065
<i>It's gonna happen.</i>

449
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:59,703
I'm gonna make
it happen.

450
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,838
<i>Lexie: So the stag's
head falls off the wall</i>

451
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,775
<i>and then there's these ghostly
footprints that lead to nowhere.</i>

452
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,377
That's not usually
a good sign.

453
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:09,746
What can I do?

454
00:24:09,747 --> 00:24:13,383
I can't speak to Archie about it
'cause he thinks I'm mad already.

455
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:16,686
If it's Robert MacDonald, he'll
be telling you someone's in danger.

456
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:18,889
But who?

457
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,057
Why not ask
the tarot cards?

458
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:23,493
They'll tell us for sure.

459
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:25,162
I don't believe
in all that stuff.

460
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,897
But the day
before yesterday

461
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,865
<i>you didn't believe
in ghosts.</i>

462
00:24:37,374 --> 00:24:39,776
So do you think you'll get
this finished by tomorrow?

463
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:41,912
Should do, if there
aren't any more problems.

464
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,814
- ( electricity crackles )
- Aah!

465
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,950
- You all right?
- You know, these wires are still live.

466
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:49,585
They shouldn't be.
I'll go and check.

467
00:24:51,722 --> 00:24:55,325
Be careful, we've had
enough shocks for one week.

468
00:24:58,395 --> 00:25:00,430
The fool.

469
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:02,432
That must be me then.

470
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:04,434
<i>No, that's not a person
in that position.</i>

471
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:07,237
It's a prediction. It
means expect the unexpected.

472
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:10,606
The wheel of fortune.

473
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:14,177
That means there's gonna be a
change in your life, a big change.

474
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:15,846
Everything turned
upside down.

475
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:20,217
And could this change
maybe involve having a baby?

476
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:23,954
- Not you, too?
- No, no, not at all.

477
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,356
What about
the other cards?

478
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:32,229
The emperor, now that means a
ruler or a figure of authority.

479
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,431
Like a laird?
So that must be Archie.

480
00:25:35,432 --> 00:25:38,401
Well, maybe,
but you have to remember

481
00:25:38,402 --> 00:25:41,271
the cards never have
just the one meaning.

482
00:25:41,272 --> 00:25:43,273
But something's going
to happen to Archie.

483
00:25:43,274 --> 00:25:45,275
What is it?

484
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,724
Dunc, can you turn
the power off?

485
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:07,964
- You seen Archie?
- No.

486
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:09,499
Is he upstairs working?

487
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,870
Yeah, on his own, without
any help from anyone else.

488
00:26:13,871 --> 00:26:15,338
<i>Where's Archie?</i>

489
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:17,173
He's doing something
in the attic.

490
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:19,910
Oh, right.
Oh, not again.

491
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,612
- I'll go and check the fuse box.
- Thanks.

492
00:26:24,248 --> 00:26:26,049
Archie?

493
00:26:38,462 --> 00:26:40,463
Archie?

494
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:41,965
Don't.

495
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:44,034
- What?
- It's too dangerous.

496
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,338
It's a simple piece
of rewiring, Lex.

497
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:53,209
<i>Duncan:
The power's off, Arch.</i>

498
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,178
No!

499
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,120
He said the power
was off.

500
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:07,123
It doesn't look
like it, does it?

501
00:27:07,124 --> 00:27:09,059
Auntie Liz read
my tarot cards.

502
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,162
- You were going to die.
- Well done, Liz.

503
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,831
What's the point trying to
finish a nursery for your children

504
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:16,666
if you're gonna kill
yourself doing it?

505
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,501
All right, all right,
I'll be careful.

506
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:23,139
Anyway, I thought
we weren't having children.

507
00:27:25,242 --> 00:27:27,077
<i>Golly:
Yep, there he is.</i>

508
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:32,949
Do you want a look?

509
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,218
I suppose I'd better
get it over with.

510
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:45,528
It's not him.

511
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:47,831
Does that help?

512
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,867
I don't know.

513
00:27:50,868 --> 00:27:53,870
You know, Duncan's asked
me to stay here with him.

514
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:55,605
He says he'll
be the father.

515
00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:57,908
What about you?

516
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:01,278
I just want what's best
for the baby.

517
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,613
You don't sound too sure.

518
00:28:03,614 --> 00:28:06,616
I'd love to do that

519
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:09,585
but it just doesn't
seem right somehow.

520
00:28:09,586 --> 00:28:12,889
Oh, I don't know
what's right anymore.

521
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,558
You know that-

522
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:18,328
you know that none of us
want to see you go.

523
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:23,099
Thanks.

524
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,702
If we finish the windows
and the ceiling today,

525
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,704
then all we have
to do tomorrow

526
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,372
is the rest
of the wallpaper

527
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:31,674
and the second coat
of gloss.

528
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:34,911
And the radiator
and the cleaning up.

529
00:28:34,912 --> 00:28:36,679
Yeah, but that won't
take any time.

530
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,116
This bet
is as good as won.

531
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:50,827
Ladies, would you
like some wine?

532
00:28:50,828 --> 00:28:53,296
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

533
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,968
- Some wine?
- No, thank you.

534
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:04,975
Did they leave all their
broomsticks by the door?

535
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:07,911
- Shh, they'll hear you.
- Ooh, they might turn me into a toad.

536
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,913
You're halfway
there already.

537
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,682
I shall be upstairs
finishing the gloss.

538
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:14,684
Archie, is there
any sherry?

539
00:29:14,685 --> 00:29:16,686
One of the ladies
is asking for it.

540
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:18,788
I'll go and get it.

541
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:22,458
Duncan. Duncan,
this is Mrs. Munroe,

542
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:25,195
she's a water diviner.
Could you possibly show her

543
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,563
where the loo is? She's
having trouble finding it.

544
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,034
<i>Good evening.</i>

545
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,203
Oh, hello,
you work here as well?

546
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:36,006
- All the time.
- Great, thanks.

547
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:39,609
<i>- Sorry.
- Clumsy.</i>

548
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,645
Hi, Andrew, I'm Lexie,
Archie's wife.

549
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:45,348
<i>- Hello, how are you?
- Hi, I see you've met Molly already.</i>

550
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:48,318
Yes, yes, yes. I hope she'll
be doing some cleaning for me.

551
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,353
Molly's useless
at cleaning.

552
00:29:50,354 --> 00:29:52,488
Well I did wonder, but
Archie recommended her.

553
00:29:52,489 --> 00:29:55,091
Said Duncan's
aunt needed-

554
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:59,829
ah, no, Molly
is Archie's mother.

555
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:05,302
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry.

556
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,003
I've made rather
a fool of myself.

557
00:30:07,004 --> 00:30:10,140
Never mind, I'm sure
it's not the first time.

558
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,776
So I assume you won't be taking the job?

559
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:15,578
No, though from what
I've seen,

560
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:17,513
you're not short
of willing scrubbers.

561
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,251
I'm so glad
you two have met.

562
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,619
Only wish I could
say the same.

563
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,958
Sherry?

564
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,362
- How's it going?
- Another five minutes.

565
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,465
This probably isn't
the best time to ask,

566
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:38,401
but Duncan seems to think
that you'll be staying here.

567
00:30:38,402 --> 00:30:40,136
I haven't made up
my mind yet.

568
00:30:40,137 --> 00:30:42,672
Okay, okay, just let
us know when you decide.

569
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,575
Maybe I should stay.

570
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:48,644
If you do,
there'll be no going back.

571
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,048
If you change
your mind,

572
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:54,017
then you'll
break his heart.

573
00:30:58,055 --> 00:31:01,691
'Caused a lot of trouble hasn't
it, for something so small?

574
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,629
Yes, but it'll
be worth it.

575
00:31:08,765 --> 00:31:12,002
I nearly forgot. Somebody left
this for you on the doorstep.

576
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,769
Oh, thanks.

577
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:26,716
What were you watching?

578
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:28,718
The world's worst
wedding video.

579
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:33,990
This is my wedding.

580
00:31:33,991 --> 00:31:35,758
<i>That's Ian.</i>

581
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:37,760
<i>What happened?</i>

582
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:39,496
<i>Couldn't go
through with it.</i>

583
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:42,432
<i>I ran away
and ended up here.</i>

584
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:45,335
<i>- is he the father?
- yeah.</i>

585
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,570
And he's found out
that I'm here.

586
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:50,273
This arrived today.

587
00:31:50,274 --> 00:31:52,275
Does he know
about the baby?

588
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:54,277
No. No.

589
00:31:56,013 --> 00:31:59,015
Well, he
doesn't have to.

590
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,019
Maybe you're right.

591
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,456
I humiliated him in front of
his family and all his friends.

592
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,391
I'm really not very
good news, you know.

593
00:32:08,392 --> 00:32:11,027
I seem to mess up
people's lives.

594
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:15,365
Not mine.

595
00:32:19,236 --> 00:32:21,237
I hope you left
some for me.

596
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:24,407
They've finished what's on their
plates and all the leftovers.

597
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:27,110
You mean my dinner's
in the coven?

598
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,079
They're a bunch
of happy mediums.

599
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,781
So how's your entry for the
art competition coming along?

600
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:34,284
Slowly, but I hope
it'll be ready in time.

601
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,152
Oh, do you paint?

602
00:32:36,153 --> 00:32:38,921
Sculpture's more my thing.
How about you?

603
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:42,892
A little. In between
cleaning assignments.

604
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:45,995
She's brilliant. She's won the
competition for the past five years.

605
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:48,398
Let me guess,
watercolors.

606
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,833
Oh, and what is
the matter with watercolors?

607
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:53,002
Nothing
as long as they're not

608
00:32:53,003 --> 00:32:55,271
those insipid,
wishy-washy landscapes.

609
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:57,173
My specialty.

610
00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:58,908
<i>That's better than
those sad people</i>

611
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:00,776
who paint portraits
of their pets.

612
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:08,284
Do you often have
spiritualists to dinner?

613
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:10,186
Oh, no,
this is a one off.

614
00:33:10,187 --> 00:33:12,255
Lexie thinks we've
got a ghost,

615
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,525
so she's invited Liz and the
weird sisters to frighten it away.

616
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,127
There is a ghost.

617
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,795
We keep it with the fairies
from the bottom of the garden

618
00:33:19,796 --> 00:33:22,198
and the leprechaun we found
at the end of the rainbow.

619
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:25,468
- Don't listen to him.
- We don't have a ghost.

620
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:28,138
I think we all
have ghosts-

621
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,805
things that keep
us awake at night,

622
00:33:29,806 --> 00:33:33,576
those private troubles that we
don't talk to anyone else about.

623
00:33:33,577 --> 00:33:36,246
Yeah, but they don't walk around
with sheets over their heads

624
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,248
getting conjured up
by ladies of a certain age

625
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,116
with too much time
on their hands.

626
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:43,286
In my experience, you can never
be too sure what form they'll take.

627
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:48,958
<i>( thunderclap )</i>

628
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:51,161
Well, it's been
a most...

629
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:53,263
memorable evening.

630
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,097
I hope we meet
again soon.

631
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:56,966
That may be difficult
to avoid.

632
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:59,435
- Good night.
- Good night.

633
00:34:06,443 --> 00:34:10,146
Archie, Archie, I want to
enter that art competition.

634
00:34:10,147 --> 00:34:11,914
You said you'd
given up painting.

635
00:34:11,915 --> 00:34:14,417
- I have, but I've taken it up again.
- Why?

636
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:16,619
That is one
of the most boring,

637
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,621
annoying men I have ever
met in my life.

638
00:34:18,622 --> 00:34:21,591
Come on, we can't stand by
and watch him win that prize.

639
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,259
Quick!

640
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,143
<i>( floor creaking )</i>

641
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:56,092
You know,
I sometimes think

642
00:34:56,093 --> 00:34:58,328
you're the only one
I could paint.

643
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,530
Oh, do stop licking
your thingies.

644
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,932
Much too
Francis Bacon for me.

645
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:09,205
<i>Lexie: It was there again last night.</i>

646
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:11,207
Great.

647
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:12,975
Great?

648
00:35:12,976 --> 00:35:15,678
No, it's not great.

649
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,780
It's terrible.

650
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:21,417
I want you to get rid
of this thing

651
00:35:21,418 --> 00:35:23,686
that's moving around
the house all night.

652
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:27,290
There's only
one option left.

653
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:31,961
We'll have to repeat the
seance exactly as it was before.

654
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:34,597
That will allow
the spirit

655
00:35:34,598 --> 00:35:36,666
to return to rest.

656
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:46,175
Have you room
for one more?

657
00:35:46,176 --> 00:35:48,544
Sure, Molly. Where would you like it?

658
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:50,580
- Over there?
- Okay.

659
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,348
But be careful,
it's still wet.

660
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:55,618
So, where's Andrew's
sculpture?

661
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,521
Oh, it's over here.
It's quite good, really.

662
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:00,390
He was telling me
how he works from life,

663
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:03,058
and he's had this model coming
round to his house every day.

664
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:05,428
Right.

665
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,332
<i>So what do you think?</i>

666
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,368
Shame there are no
pigeons around.

667
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,973
I've brought some
stuff from Auntie Liz.

668
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:19,642
Toys, games, whatever.

669
00:36:19,643 --> 00:36:21,744
Now I've made a list of
things that we need to do.

670
00:36:21,745 --> 00:36:24,146
Have you registered with
Dr. Brown in the village yet?

671
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:25,281
- Yes.
- Great.

672
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:27,283
Now, something else
we need to decide.

673
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:29,885
Are we gonna stay here
or move into the village?

674
00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:33,423
Because if we're gonna move in there,
Auntie Liz has got a room we can have.

675
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,292
And have you seen the school
yet? we need to talk about that.

676
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:38,695
I think we can probably
leave it for a few days.

677
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,963
Yeah.
Now, something else.

678
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:44,767
Ah, yeah, are we gonna get
married? You know, for the baby?

679
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:47,069
That's not a good reason
for getting married.

680
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,171
No, you're right,
but we could anyway.

681
00:36:49,172 --> 00:36:52,074
I'm not very good
at weddings.

682
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:54,577
Of course.

683
00:36:54,578 --> 00:36:56,579
No wedding just yet.

684
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,414
Duncan, hold on,
we need to talk.

685
00:36:58,415 --> 00:37:00,916
Not now though,
I promised I'd help Archie.

686
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:03,653
And Lexie, and-

687
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,322
I don't know whether
I'm coming or going.

688
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:20,336
"Useless"?

689
00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:22,805
Being a bit hard on
yourself, aren't you?

690
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:24,940
"Useless" is the name
of the dog.

691
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:26,409
What's your piece
called?

692
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,378
"Bust of a Young Girl. "

693
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:30,145
What a lot
of bust she has.

694
00:37:30,146 --> 00:37:32,147
Lexie told you the winner
has to make a speech?

695
00:37:32,148 --> 00:37:34,083
Yes, she did
mention it.

696
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:37,587
That's why you're making notes, you're
that certain you're going to win.

697
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,589
I make no great
claims about my work

698
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,258
but I am absolutely certain
I'll be making a speech.

699
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:45,227
I'm not sure what is worse, your
false modesty or your smugness.

700
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:47,497
<i>Lexie:
Andrew, are you ready?</i>

701
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:53,569
( banging )

702
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,305
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have
your attention, please?

703
00:37:56,306 --> 00:37:59,609
Thank you very much
for coming

704
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,278
to the Glenbogle
art competition.

705
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:05,180
Unfortunately,
Mrs. Mackay,

706
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:06,783
who was going to be
our judge today,

707
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,951
had a bit
of an accident with her easel.

708
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:12,187
<i>So at the very
last minute</i>

709
00:38:12,188 --> 00:38:16,392
Andrew Booth very kindly withdrew
his entry from the competition

710
00:38:16,393 --> 00:38:18,761
to take her place.

711
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:21,230
<i>- Andrew.
- ( applause )</i>

712
00:38:23,266 --> 00:38:25,535
Thank you. I'd like
to congratulate

713
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,336
all the exhibitors
here today.

714
00:38:27,337 --> 00:38:31,006
I'm enormously impressed by the
very high standard of all the works.

715
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:33,843
However, we have
to have a winner.

716
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,779
<i>Now there is one picture
that stands out for me.</i>

717
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,781
<i>It's a beautiful
composition,</i>

718
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:41,083
<i>it's got a real
life to it.</i>

719
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:43,319
It's "Useless"
by Molly MacDonald.

720
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,555
<i>- You won.
- ( applause )</i>

721
00:38:47,223 --> 00:38:51,093
I hope you will accept
my exhibit as the prize.

722
00:38:51,094 --> 00:38:53,463
Oh, thank you
so much.

723
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,765
Congratulations.

724
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:01,537
- No.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

725
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:04,006
there's tea and refreshments
at the back of the hall.

726
00:39:06,142 --> 00:39:10,079
Well, you've changed my
mind about pet portraits.

727
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,247
Good,
because, in a way,

728
00:39:12,248 --> 00:39:14,784
it was because of you that
I started painting again.

729
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,052
You stopped when
your husband died.

730
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:19,655
- How did you know that?
- A guess.

731
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:21,624
And I saw that portrait
you did of him.

732
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,559
The odd thing is,

733
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,395
since then, every time I
try to paint, I see his face.

734
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:29,231
Still, I suppose
I cheated with "Useless. "

735
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:31,567
There is quite
a strong resemblance.

736
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:36,105
<i>So I inspired you to pick
up your brushes again?</i>

737
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:39,809
No, with you it was more
irritation than inspiration.

738
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:43,779
Don't forget your prize.

739
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,181
Why don't you
finish it first?

740
00:39:49,452 --> 00:39:51,487
What?

741
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:53,789
I didn't say anything.

742
00:39:58,328 --> 00:40:00,463
<i>( thunderclap )</i>

743
00:40:06,002 --> 00:40:07,737
Thanks, Molly.

744
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,506
I know this doesn't make any
sense but I had to give it a try.

745
00:40:10,507 --> 00:40:13,008
Well, anything if you
think it'll help.

746
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,182
Robert MacDonald,
can you hear me?

747
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,731
Lexie,

748
00:40:35,732 --> 00:40:37,700
speak to him.

749
00:40:40,837 --> 00:40:44,273
I know you've been
trying to reach me.

750
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:46,241
What do you want?

751
00:41:13,403 --> 00:41:15,404
<i>( creaking )</i>

752
00:41:15,405 --> 00:41:17,372
<i>( knocking )</i>

753
00:41:43,232 --> 00:41:45,200
- ( banging )
- Hey!

754
00:42:05,088 --> 00:42:08,323
- What's going on?
- Found your ghost.

755
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:12,160
So it's you that's been
creeping round the house.

756
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:14,062
I'll explain everything
to Irene Stuart.

757
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:15,898
You can tell us or you
can tell the police.

758
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:21,704
Okay, look,
I'm a private detective.

759
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,206
I was hired
to find Irene.

760
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:26,509
<i>It was supposed to be
a straight-forward job-</i>

761
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,444
<i>find Irene, take
a couple of pictures.</i>

762
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:32,047
<i>Duncan: He tried to work
me over in the pub, I know.</i>

763
00:42:32,048 --> 00:42:34,149
<i>Detective: Yeah, well,
didn't get much, did I?</i>

764
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,685
<i>Just had to listen to you
droning on and on and on.</i>

765
00:42:36,686 --> 00:42:40,355
<i>So I didn't feel too bad
when I borrowed your keys.</i>

766
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:42,691
<i>Now I've installed
covert video surveillance</i>

767
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:44,593
<i>in some
pretty heavy locations,</i>

768
00:42:44,594 --> 00:42:47,062
<i>but they were a piece of
cake compared to this gaff.</i>

769
00:42:47,063 --> 00:42:49,765
<i>It's a death-trap.</i>

770
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:52,267
<i>It was a test of nerve.</i>

771
00:42:52,268 --> 00:42:55,370
<i>But still, nothing
I couldn't handle.</i>

772
00:42:55,371 --> 00:42:58,707
...dust on the carpet.
Let's go to bed.

773
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,976
<i>Archie: What was your
plan for this evening?</i>

774
00:43:00,977 --> 00:43:02,845
<i>You were going to bug
the suits of armor,</i>

775
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,980
hang some listening devices
from the chandeliers?

776
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:08,551
No. My client wanted me to
deliver a letter to Irene.

777
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,719
<i>With all this surveillance
you didn't notice</i>

778
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,689
that we do actually have a
letterbox? I'm calling the police.

779
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,691
No, this is all
my fault.

780
00:43:15,692 --> 00:43:18,093
I don't want anyone
else involved.

781
00:43:18,094 --> 00:43:20,563
My coming here,
hiding,

782
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,731
it's caused enough
trouble already.

783
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:25,968
- We can't just let him get away with it.
- Please, Archie.

784
00:43:28,972 --> 00:43:31,106
Make sure he doesn't
get lost on the way out.

785
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:34,043
No worries, boss.
Come on.

786
00:43:37,246 --> 00:43:39,247
This is for you.

787
00:43:39,248 --> 00:43:42,117
From Ian, obviously.

788
00:43:42,118 --> 00:43:45,087
- Irene?
- Just let her read it first.

789
00:43:50,293 --> 00:43:51,994
<i>( knocking )</i>

790
00:43:51,995 --> 00:43:53,896
<i>Duncan:
Irene? you there?</i>

791
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:56,799
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm here.

792
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,301
<i>You okay?
What are you doing?</i>

793
00:43:59,302 --> 00:44:03,138
Nothing. can you
just give me a minute?

794
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:06,008
<i>Okay.</i>

795
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:09,111
<i>I'm here if you
want me.</i>

796
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:11,580
I know, Duncan.

797
00:44:19,522 --> 00:44:21,624
( giggling )

798
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,761
Okay.
Open your eyes.

799
00:44:26,796 --> 00:44:29,098
Oh, Archie.

800
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,366
What happened
to all the sheep?

801
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:33,368
Well, it's like you
were saying last night.

802
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:36,939
We spend far too much time thinking
about the past and the future

803
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,374
and what we should be doing
is enjoying what we've got.

804
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:42,511
So I've made this room
a kind of blank canvas.

805
00:44:42,512 --> 00:44:45,014
We decide together what
we want to do with it.

806
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,116
And what about carrying
on the family line?

807
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:50,152
- It doesn't really matter.
- Of course it does.

808
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:53,122
What would I know?
I don't have a family tree.

809
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:56,358
I don't even have
a family pot plant.

810
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:59,828
You need to tell me what you
want, I can't read your mind, Arch.

811
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:02,731
I want you. And I want you to be happy.

812
00:45:02,732 --> 00:45:04,566
Oh, and by the way,
I won the bet.

813
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:08,403
Ah-ha!
That is not finished.

814
00:45:08,404 --> 00:45:11,606
- It was finished.
- Thanks to Golly and Duncan.

815
00:45:11,607 --> 00:45:13,441
Okay, so I cheated
and it's a mess

816
00:45:13,442 --> 00:45:15,544
but it's still a kind
of moral victory.

817
00:45:15,545 --> 00:45:19,281
Okay, then I can take you out
for a kind of moral dinner.

818
00:45:19,282 --> 00:45:22,084
I wouldn't mind
staying in.

819
00:45:22,085 --> 00:45:25,187
You know what
we could do?

820
00:45:25,188 --> 00:45:26,755
What?

821
00:45:26,756 --> 00:45:29,825
We could start thinking about
something to put in here.

822
00:45:29,826 --> 00:45:31,927
What do you
have in mind?

823
00:45:31,928 --> 00:45:34,429
Curtains.

824
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,832
Curtains?

825
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,388
Is that you away then?

826
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,390
Yeah.

827
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,392
Can you tell Archie
and Lexie for me?

828
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:05,628
I'll call them,
but I really hate goodbyes.

829
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:07,463
Yeah, I gathered that.

830
00:46:09,098 --> 00:46:11,433
<i>What about Duncan?</i>

831
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:17,673
I'm sorry, I just
can't face him again.

832
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:20,242
I wish things hadn't
worked out like this.

833
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,312
Me too.

834
00:46:25,014 --> 00:46:27,583
Will you tell him,
after I've gone?

835
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,618
Sure.

836
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:32,020
Thanks.

837
00:46:56,646 --> 00:46:59,481
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

838
00:46:59,482 --> 00:47:02,618
Yes. We can go
and talk to Ian

839
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:04,920
and then we can
come back home.

840
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:07,823
- This isn't my home.
- You're running away again.

841
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:10,593
No, for me, staying
here is running away.

842
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:11,660
Why?

843
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,663
Why are you doing this?

844
00:47:14,664 --> 00:47:18,234
Because every time I look at my
baby's face I'm going to see Ian.

845
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:20,502
I can't run away
from that anymore.

846
00:47:20,503 --> 00:47:22,838
That's why it can't
work for you and me.

847
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,140
Irene, I love you.

848
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:29,278
Duncan, this isn't
about us anymore.

849
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,847
This is about my child.

850
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:33,616
And I know you
want to take on

00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:35,584
the responsibility
of being the father,

852
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:37,253
but you're not,
Ian is.

853
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:40,021
And he's the one with the
important job, and the big money.

854
00:47:40,022 --> 00:47:41,923
Don't-
don't do this.

855
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:49,231
You're so kind.

856
00:47:49,232 --> 00:47:51,300
I'm fed up
with being kind,

857
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:54,803
because kind means
being the nice guy

858
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:58,340
who smiles and waves goodbye and I'm not doing that
- not anymore.

859
00:47:58,341 --> 00:48:00,376
I'd have given anything

860
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,344
to spend my life
with you.

861
00:48:05,014 --> 00:48:07,015
And however you
look at it,

862
00:48:07,016 --> 00:48:09,752
you just don't feel
the same.

863
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,354
You never did.

864
00:48:12,355 --> 00:48:15,424
This isn't what I want.

865
00:48:17,026 --> 00:48:19,060
Oh, Duncan, please,

866
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:20,829
can't we be friends?

867
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:25,501
No. I've got friends.

868
00:49:01,971 --> 00:49:03,872
Come on, son.

869
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:06,241
Come on.
I'll drive.

870
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,960
You come here to talk
to father, don't you?

871
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,495
Silly, isn't it?

872
00:49:28,197 --> 00:49:31,734
But I always feel a little
closer to him when I'm out here.

873
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,102
But he's gone.

874
00:49:34,103 --> 00:49:36,104
And we miss him.

875
00:49:36,105 --> 00:49:38,073
Yes.

876
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:44,480
Knowing father, he's on some
big celestial golf course,

877
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,415
stuck in a bunker
probably.

878
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:48,717
It would be nice
to think so,

879
00:49:48,718 --> 00:49:51,119
but I really don't believe
in that sort of thing.

880
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,355
You go in.

881
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,399
Useless, you silly dog.

00:50:11,307 --> 00:50:13,609
