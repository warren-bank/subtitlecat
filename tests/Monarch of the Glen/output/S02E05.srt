1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,035
Okay, everyone.
Dunc, we need that fire going.

2
00:00:08,036 --> 00:00:10,037
That's my Savile Row suit. I wear that!

3
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:11,772
Then you can
carry on wearing it,

4
00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:13,974
if you don't mind
being stuffed and mounted.

5
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:16,676
Is nothing sacred? People
rifling through your wardrobe,

6
00:00:16,677 --> 00:00:18,913
valuable early editions going missing.

7
00:00:18,914 --> 00:00:20,281
Archie:
What early editions?

8
00:00:20,282 --> 00:00:22,283
"Kidnapped," by Robert
Louis Stevenson.

9
00:00:24,286 --> 00:00:25,552
Your pen's run out.

10
00:00:25,553 --> 00:00:26,586
( laughs )

11
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:28,622
Ultraviolet ink.
See?

12
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,858
Do try to keep up
with technology, Archie.

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,795
Since you're determined to open
our house to the great unwashed,

14
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:36,863
I'm marking everything
that isn't nailed down!

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,799
It's not the whole house,
just this room.

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,068
There, what do you think?

17
00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:42,369
Ludicrous!

18
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,972
Don't you realise
the aristocracy needs mystique?

19
00:00:44,973 --> 00:00:48,042
The aristocracy needs funds. Our
next grant share depends on this.

20
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:50,110
We might get away with it.
Come along, out.

21
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:52,879
<i>Archie: No one goes in here
between now and Wednesday.</i>

22
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,482
Then we open the door and
take the heritage committee

23
00:00:55,483 --> 00:00:57,517
back to the days of
our Victorian ancestors.

24
00:00:57,518 --> 00:00:59,519
<i>( falling debris,
Duncan coughing )</i>

25
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:09,930
I think I should
have used...

26
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:11,498
a bigger sheet.

27
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:14,634
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

28
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:54,908
They're casing the joint
in broad daylight!

29
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,110
Where are the dogs?

30
00:02:00,348 --> 00:02:03,017
Come on, boys, get him!
Get him! Kill, kill!

31
00:02:03,018 --> 00:02:04,451
<i>( dogs barking )</i>

32
00:02:09,224 --> 00:02:11,325
Hello there.

33
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:14,061
Honestly. I'd be better off
with a team of gerbils.

34
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:15,729
Geordie!

35
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:18,932
How wonderful
to see you!

36
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:20,834
How are you doing,
duchess?

37
00:02:20,835 --> 00:02:22,769
Hector, you remember
Geordie?

38
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,705
Your bookie, yes!
Business good, is it?

39
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:27,707
I had to let
the roller go.

40
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,277
Ah, but you've
still got the shoes!

41
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:33,447
You look like a man in need
of refreshment, come along.

42
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:37,251
In need of a good
horsewhipping, if you ask me.

43
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:42,222
Paintings, costumes, furniture,
caked in soot, ruined.

44
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:44,058
It's not funny,
Katrina.

45
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:45,859
No, sorry,
of course not.

46
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,494
I've called in a firm
of cleaners,

47
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:49,629
but they can't make it
till the end of the week.

48
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,166
We're never going to open in
time, and we need that grant.

49
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:55,001
So... you want me
to nobble the council?

50
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:57,104
It's not about nobbling the council-

51
00:02:57,105 --> 00:02:59,906
what?! You never come to see
me unless you need something.

52
00:02:59,907 --> 00:03:03,277
- This tableau was your stupid idea.
- It is not a stupid idea!

53
00:03:03,278 --> 00:03:05,645
Who cares about the life
of a laird 100 years ago?

54
00:03:05,646 --> 00:03:08,148
It's not as if that much has
changed for you lot anyway.

55
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:11,251
Apart from dry rot, death
duties and the council tax, no.

56
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:12,686
My heart bleeds.

57
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:15,822
I suppose you'd rather I
restored a Victorian croft,

58
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:19,659
and set up some twee little scene
with a noble son of the soil.

59
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,861
Well, it'd have
more relevance than

60
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:23,997
a load of dummies
in posh frocks.

61
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:27,134
Right, fine, okay.

62
00:03:27,135 --> 00:03:28,668
What?

63
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:31,538
I will set up a tableau
in a Victorian croft.

64
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:34,774
In 36 hours?
Good luck.

65
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:36,643
Thank you so much
for your help.

66
00:03:36,644 --> 00:03:38,112
<i>Fergal:
Katrina?</i>

67
00:03:38,113 --> 00:03:39,980
<i>Hiya, boss.</i>

68
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:42,116
Um, yours.

69
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:43,750
Picked off the estate?

70
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:45,519
Then they're his.

71
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,654
Is everything
okay?

72
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:49,623
The laird just had
some council business,

73
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:51,691
but we're finished now,
aren't we, Archie?

74
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,660
Oh, we are most definitely finished.

75
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:02,035
Took me ages
to find those.

76
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:03,703
<i>Katrina: sorry.</i>

77
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,245
No, I don't want
to go to a rave.

78
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:13,247
It'll be fun!

79
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:15,882
Two hours in
a clapped-out Land Rover?

80
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:18,785
Paying good money to leap around
in the mud till my ears bleed?

81
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:21,321
That's not my idea
of a dream date.

82
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:24,191
Ah! But it wouldn't be a date.

83
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:26,693
It would be two mates
out for a good time.

84
00:04:26,694 --> 00:04:30,197
Oh, go on, Lex,
what do you say?

85
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:31,798
I say-

86
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:36,136
lose the eyeshadow,
it went out in the '80s.

87
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:40,541
Thank you.

88
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:48,248
Mmmm!

89
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:50,584
That's the first
I've eaten for a while.

90
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:55,389
Lady luck
ran out on me.

91
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,291
Took my worldly
possessions with her.

92
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:59,759
You lost everything
on one horse?!

93
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,361
Not a horse, no!

94
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:03,096
Turn of the cards.

95
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:05,899
Not as sharp as
I used to be, it seems.

96
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,068
- How very sordid.
- Hector, please.

97
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:10,470
I had to liquidate
my assets pretty quick.

98
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:12,673
<i>The roller,
my premises...</i>

99
00:05:12,674 --> 00:05:14,675
my I.O.U.'s.

100
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:16,510
Oh, I see.

101
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:18,612
<i>I had to pass them on,
I'm sorry.</i>

102
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:20,414
You mean you owe
this man money?!

103
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:21,481
<i>Oh, no.</i>

104
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:24,384
Molly's always
settled her debts.

105
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:25,952
He cleaned me out,
Molly.

106
00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:29,256
- Who did, exactly?
- His name's Murdo.

107
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:31,325
He owns a nightclub
called "The Knave. "

108
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:33,993
<i>Big poker game
at the back.</i>

109
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:35,462
<i>Big money.</i>

110
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:37,598
How much money does Molly
owe this Mr. Murdo?

111
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,500
We'll come to some arrangement.
I'm sure he's a reasonable man.

112
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:43,036
Depends what you mean
by "reasonable. "

113
00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:45,706
Tell me, where are you
staying in the meantime?

114
00:05:45,707 --> 00:05:47,274
Here and there.

115
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:49,409
You don't mean to say
you're sleeping in that van?

116
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,478
It's surprisingly
well appointed-

117
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,580
and the views
are fabulous.

118
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:55,949
You must stay here till
you're back on your feet.

119
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,218
I wouldn't want to impose
on your hospitality.

120
00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:00,621
Aw, what a shame.
Lovely seeing you.

121
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:02,989
- I insist!
- I don't want to be any trouble.

122
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,191
You won't,
will he, Hector?

123
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:09,996
If you'll excuse me-

124
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:12,766
I'm just going
to count the spoons.

125
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:20,940
<i>Golly: Now this could
be what you want, Archie.</i>

126
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:23,176
<i>The roof's still on.
The walls are sound.</i>

127
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:25,078
<i>It's not too far
from the road,</i>

128
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,147
<i>so the punters won't have
to get their feet wet.</i>

129
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:30,384
<i>Plus the jacuzzi
is full of oysters,</i>

130
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:33,019
and the cable TV
is on the blink.

131
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,622
Archie: Am I some kind of dinosaur?

132
00:06:35,623 --> 00:06:37,157
What?

133
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:40,093
Some grasping
feudal tyrant,

134
00:06:40,094 --> 00:06:42,061
desperate to bleed
the peasants dry?

135
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:44,698
- Why don't you ask Katrina?
- Yeah, right.

136
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,100
As if I give a toss
about her opinion.

137
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:49,202
As if I care about
anything she says.

138
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:52,639
What?

139
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,576
Oh, methinks the laird
doth protest too much.

140
00:06:56,577 --> 00:06:59,513
Look, I couldn't
care less about her,

141
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:01,415
and she feels just
the same about me.

142
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,150
She'd rather hang out with
the wild man of the woods.

143
00:07:04,151 --> 00:07:07,387
- Fergal? Don't think so.
- And he is welcome to her.

144
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:10,724
In fact, a tenner says they'll get
it together by the end of the week.

145
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:12,192
Archie!

146
00:07:12,193 --> 00:07:14,628
I'll throw in a few
words of encouragement.

147
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:16,162
They'll hardly
even notice.

148
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:18,532
Then she'll be out of my
hair, once and for all.

149
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,535
She's in your hair,
is she?

150
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:23,870
You don't think
I can manage it?

151
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:26,440
All right,
20 to your 10.

152
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:27,907
I'll take the bet.

153
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:30,410
But believe me, son,
you're going to lose.

154
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:34,614
Archie: In the meantime,
all we have to do

155
00:07:34,615 --> 00:07:36,783
is transform this
- into a tourist attraction.

156
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:38,785
Ah, well,
good luck.

157
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:41,221
Golly!

158
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:43,490
Listen, son, it's not
a ghillie you need.

159
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:45,592
It's a shrink!

160
00:07:45,593 --> 00:07:47,694
I've got beasts
to feed.

161
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:52,432
( bleating )

162
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,657
<i>( door opens )</i>

163
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:26,600
Can I help you?

164
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:29,002
I'm looking
for a Mr. Murdo.

165
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:31,304
And what business
do you have with him?

166
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:34,441
My friend Geordie
owes him some money.

167
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:37,010
Go home, doll.
You don't belong here.

168
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:40,580
Stitches,
who's your girlfriend?

169
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:43,517
The name is
Molly MacDonald.

170
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:45,819
I'm a friend
of Geordie's.

171
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,288
<i>You're
Mrs. MacDonald?</i>

172
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:50,624
- How do you do?
- Hello, what can I do for you?

173
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,092
Don't worry about them.
We have no secrets.

174
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:57,330
I understand that you've
taken over Geordie's business?

175
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:00,934
I am administering his
accounts, that's correct.

176
00:09:00,935 --> 00:09:03,470
Well, he laid a lot
of bets on my behalf.

177
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:07,106
He was very reluctant
to pass on your details.

178
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:10,009
I understand there's a
sum of �4,000 outstanding.

179
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,645
Actually,
it's three.

180
00:09:11,646 --> 00:09:15,114
<i>Actually, it was three
- last week.</i>

181
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:16,850
I'm a businessman,
Mrs. MacDonald,

182
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:18,518
I like to encourage
prompt repayment.

183
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,253
You will be repaid,
I promise.

184
00:09:20,254 --> 00:09:22,322
I don't run the business on promises.

185
00:09:22,323 --> 00:09:24,290
- It's strictly cash only.
- Mr. Murdo,

186
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,659
I am not the sort
of person-

187
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,794
I don't care what sort
of person you are.

188
00:09:29,464 --> 00:09:32,131
Well, surely we can come
to some arrangement?

189
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:34,334
Tell you what,

190
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:37,036
you can work in the kitchen,
help with the washing up.

191
00:09:39,507 --> 00:09:41,307
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Murdo.

192
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:43,510
I'll be in touch.

193
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:52,352
This place stinks.

194
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:54,120
Yep, it's authentic.

195
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:56,890
It is possible
to overdo the authenticity.

196
00:09:56,891 --> 00:10:00,694
Thanks for mucking in-
with the mucking out.

197
00:10:00,695 --> 00:10:02,395
Actually...

198
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:03,930
I wanted to pick
your brains.

199
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:06,099
It's pretty lean pickings
up there, I'm afraid.

200
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,568
You've known Katrina for
quite awhile now, haven't you?

201
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:10,403
Yeah, since we
were kids.

202
00:10:10,404 --> 00:10:13,106
Only I need some...
inside information.

203
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:14,941
On her likes
and dislikes.

204
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:18,111
Fergal:
I want to wow her.

205
00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:20,146
<i>Wow her,
or woo her?</i>

206
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:22,215
<i>Wow or woo...</i>

207
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:24,083
I think both.

208
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:26,720
I've got a really good
feeling about this, Archie.

209
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:28,755
I don't want
to blow it.

210
00:10:28,756 --> 00:10:31,224
She did not go for
those flowers I gave her.

211
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:32,893
She doesn't like
cut flowers-

212
00:10:32,894 --> 00:10:36,429
she says she's always
waiting for them to die.

213
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,032
She's very fond
of trees-

214
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:40,934
poplar,
silver birch.

215
00:10:40,935 --> 00:10:43,970
A tree...
a tree, of course.

216
00:10:49,043 --> 00:10:50,911
I thought you two
didn't get on?

217
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:52,979
Whatever gave you
that idea?

218
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,481
Nothing.
Thanks a lot, Arch.

219
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:05,592
<i>( distant bagpipes playing )</i>

220
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:16,502
<i>( bagpipes
grow louder )</i>

221
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,383
( pipes stop )

222
00:11:56,777 --> 00:11:58,478
Thank you.

223
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:03,683
Oh, that looks
fabulous.

224
00:12:03,684 --> 00:12:06,086
Have you any
brown sauce?

225
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:08,054
<i>H.P.?</i>

226
00:12:08,055 --> 00:12:09,923
I'll go
and have a look.

227
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:11,424
Quite a selection.

228
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:13,627
Don't they have cutlery
in Kilmarnock?

229
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:17,831
- Start from the outside and work in.
- Oh, really?

230
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:18,832
Molly?

231
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,466
I'll go and fetch
another plate.

232
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:22,035
Thank you, Lexie.

233
00:12:23,437 --> 00:12:25,071
Where have you been
all day?

234
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:28,407
I've been to see
Mr. Murdo.

235
00:12:28,408 --> 00:12:31,244
He wants me
to repay him this week.

236
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:32,679
What's the problem?
Pay the man!

237
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,415
Hector, it's �4,000!

238
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,686
4,000 poun - ?! How in heaven's name
are we going to tell Archie?!

239
00:12:39,687 --> 00:12:41,587
Do we have
to tell Archie?

240
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:43,823
- Mmm, smells good.
- Ah-!

241
00:12:43,824 --> 00:12:46,092
I wish I could say
the same about you.

242
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:48,061
Thank you.

243
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:49,863
Hello, Geordie,
how are you?

244
00:12:49,864 --> 00:12:51,330
Oh, I'm fine.

245
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:53,733
Molly: Geordie's staying
with us for a little while.

246
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:55,368
<i>Archie:
Right, good.</i>

247
00:12:55,369 --> 00:12:58,337
Would you like me to hose
you down before dinner?

248
00:12:58,338 --> 00:13:01,908
No, I can't stay. I'll just have
a sandwich or something, please.

249
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:04,277
All right, milord.

250
00:13:06,346 --> 00:13:07,647
( sighs )

251
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:10,784
( forced laughter )

252
00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:13,820
Everything all right?

253
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:17,557
Splendid, splendid, only we seem
to have run out of brown sauce.

254
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:20,026
That's all right.
I'll make do with ketchup.

255
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:24,230
Right.
I'll leave you to it.

256
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:46,419
( sighs )

257
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:27,193
You're up early.

258
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:28,694
Got lots to do.

259
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:31,297
No rest
for the lone ranger, eh?

260
00:14:31,298 --> 00:14:34,700
Not until Archie's
croft is finished, no.

261
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:40,473
So, what do you do for
relaxation, kemosabe?

262
00:14:40,474 --> 00:14:42,075
Ride into the village,

263
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:44,443
and show all the girls
your six-gun?

264
00:14:44,444 --> 00:14:48,648
- I usually read a book.
- Oh, an intellectual.

265
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:52,318
<i>I like a man
with a bulging cortex.</i>

266
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:56,422
So... would you like
to go to work on an egg?

267
00:14:58,225 --> 00:15:00,860
Thanks. Maybe...

268
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:03,196
Duncan...
would be up for that.

269
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:06,565
<i>And what will
Tonto be having?</i>

270
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:07,967
Soft-boiled
with soldiers?

271
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:11,604
What was all that about?
You were coming on to him!

272
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:13,306
And what's that
got to do with you?

273
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:15,408
I thought we were
just mates?

274
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:17,143
Aye, right,
we are- but-

275
00:15:17,144 --> 00:15:19,279
I was thinking about
asking him to this rave.

276
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,381
What do you think? I
mean, speaking as mates?

277
00:15:23,818 --> 00:15:25,185
Why not?

278
00:15:25,186 --> 00:15:27,887
<i>Go on.</i>

279
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:29,823
Ask away!

280
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,327
What about
your soldiers?

281
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:37,864
They're dismissed.

282
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:43,203
<i>You do not
throw these out!</i>

283
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:46,139
Put this in there,

284
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,107
and you charge
six quid a shot.

285
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:49,843
Anybody complains,

286
00:15:49,844 --> 00:15:51,878
you refer them
to Stitches. Okay?

287
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,379
Mr. Murdo.

288
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,749
Oh, hello.
Bring your marigolds?

289
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,417
No, but I've
brought you this.

290
00:15:58,418 --> 00:16:00,220
What's it worth?

291
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:04,724
To me, it's priceless.
To you, about �4,000.

292
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:06,625
Well, let's see
what the jeweler says.

293
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:09,528
Before you take it, I have
a proposition to put to you.

294
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:12,165
You're not just a businessman,
are you, Mr. Murdo?

295
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:15,235
You're... an entrepreneur, a risk taker.

296
00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:18,204
I could hand this over,
and you could sell it,

297
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:19,873
but where would be
the thrill in that?

298
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:23,109
You like cards
- let's play poker for it.

299
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:26,079
Do you know how
to play poker?

300
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,515
Oh, yes. It's rather
like bridge, isn't it?

301
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:31,617
It's my money.

302
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:33,419
Why would I want
to play cards for it?

303
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,022
Mr. Murdo, anyone
would think you lacked-

304
00:16:36,023 --> 00:16:38,258
what do you call it-
bottle.

305
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,928
Right.

306
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:44,030
Your house.
Tonight.

307
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,099
My house?

308
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,867
Ah... his lordship

309
00:16:47,868 --> 00:16:51,304
doesn't know about your
expensive habits, does he?

310
00:16:51,305 --> 00:16:54,507
Shall we say... 7:30?

311
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:57,277
Bring some friends if
you like, and black tie.

312
00:16:57,278 --> 00:16:59,979
Of course, appearances are
so important, aren't they?

313
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,314
They certainly are.

314
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:04,250
Even if you're
just selling whiskey.

315
00:17:07,587 --> 00:17:09,522
Why did you agree?

316
00:17:09,523 --> 00:17:11,958
I've got nothing
to lose.

317
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,929
She's got plenty.

318
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:23,769
What about
furniture?

319
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,139
I'll have to fill up
a trailer at the house.

320
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,107
- Once we fix the floor.
- And strip the panels.

321
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:30,643
- And rebuild the fire.
- And paint the place.

322
00:17:30,644 --> 00:17:32,912
This is insane.

323
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:36,549
Hello.

324
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,484
Oh, great.
That's all we need.

325
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:40,486
Don't worry, it's not
an official inspection.

326
00:17:40,487 --> 00:17:42,255
( sniffs )
Phfaw!

327
00:17:42,256 --> 00:17:43,823
Good thing, too.

328
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:45,691
Hums a bit,
doesn't it?

329
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:47,760
Unless, of course,
it's you two.

330
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:49,728
Did you want
something?

331
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:52,565
I wanted to see Fergal,
actually.

332
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:55,335
Right, excuse me.

333
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:02,942
Now... somebody...

334
00:18:02,943 --> 00:18:07,180
planted a silver birch
outside my house last night.

335
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:09,148
Right.

336
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:11,750
I'm sorry
to hear that.

337
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:14,120
<i>I'll come over
straightaway and dig it up.</i>

338
00:18:14,121 --> 00:18:15,688
<i>Stop.</i>

339
00:18:15,689 --> 00:18:17,756
It's beautiful.

340
00:18:17,757 --> 00:18:19,892
How did you know?

341
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:22,061
It reminded me
of you,

342
00:18:22,062 --> 00:18:24,730
<i>lithe and bright...</i>

343
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:27,666
<i>and beautiful.</i>

344
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:30,536
It's funny, that.

345
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:32,771
'Cause you remind me
of an oak.

346
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:33,939
Do I, now?

347
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,043
Dense and knobbly,
and full of squirrels.

348
00:18:37,044 --> 00:18:38,911
<i>( both giggle )</i>

349
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:44,183
It's all right.

350
00:18:44,184 --> 00:18:46,685
Don't worry.
I'll get a pane of glass.

351
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:49,322
I thought you were trying
to fix the place up,

352
00:18:49,323 --> 00:18:50,756
not demolish it.

353
00:18:50,757 --> 00:18:52,992
It's not easy,
with you two canoodling.

354
00:18:52,993 --> 00:18:55,361
<i>We were not
canoodling.</i>

355
00:18:56,596 --> 00:19:00,066
He planted a silver
birch outside my house.

356
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:02,101
That is the single most romantic thing

357
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:04,137
anyone has ever
done for me.

358
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:06,605
Please, don't try
and spoil it.

359
00:19:06,606 --> 00:19:08,474
I'm not trying
to spoil it.

360
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:11,944
Fergal is a lovely guy.
He deserves a lovely-

361
00:19:14,014 --> 00:19:16,315
I'd better go and see
where that glass is.

362
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:19,885
I can't believe you
invited that hoodlum here!

363
00:19:19,886 --> 00:19:22,155
I got into this mess,
I'll get us out of it.

364
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:24,223
Molly, you can't do this.
He's a cardshark.

365
00:19:24,224 --> 00:19:26,659
I am not giving in
without a fight, Geordie.

366
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,661
I'm sorry I ever got you involved.

367
00:19:28,662 --> 00:19:30,763
Apology accepted.
Perhaps you'll climb

368
00:19:30,764 --> 00:19:32,898
into that dreary
shatterbang and disappear!

369
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:34,567
No, Hector, I need
Geordie to help me.

370
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:36,635
- Don't you think he's helped enough?
- Please.

371
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:39,372
I'm going to play for my
pendant and clear my debt.

372
00:19:39,373 --> 00:19:41,974
I don't need you two
sniping at each other.

373
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:44,710
Now, what are we
going to do about Archie?

374
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:47,280
You won't have to do anything.
He's so busy with that croft,

375
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:49,315
he wouldn't know it
if the house burned down.

376
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:51,884
Good!
So, let's get to work.

377
00:20:14,674 --> 00:20:16,942
No, Hector, no, no.
Leave it.

378
00:20:16,943 --> 00:20:19,412
Leave it.
I'll do it.

379
00:20:23,783 --> 00:20:26,085
There we are.
Easy.

380
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:50,843
That cheeky-
that's my car!

381
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:23,576
Good evening,
Mr. Murdo.

382
00:21:23,577 --> 00:21:25,444
Old MacDonald's
Farm, eh?

383
00:21:25,445 --> 00:21:27,146
Very nice.

384
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:29,915
This is my husband, Hector.
Geordie, you know.

385
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,285
You take in
the homeless.

386
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:34,019
That's very noble.

387
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,422
These are my good friends,
Hugh, Benny.

388
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:39,458
Would you gentlemen care for
something to eat, after your journey?

389
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:41,093
Maybe later, eh?

390
00:21:41,094 --> 00:21:43,629
Let's get straight down
to business, shall we?

391
00:21:51,238 --> 00:21:53,573
Gentlemen, do
please follow me.

392
00:21:55,175 --> 00:21:57,610
Have you fallen on
somebody's fear, Geordie?

393
00:21:57,611 --> 00:22:00,713
I'm very lucky. Mrs.
MacDonald's a good friend.

394
00:22:00,714 --> 00:22:03,282
She's gonna need a bit
of luck herself tonight.

395
00:22:03,283 --> 00:22:06,185
I've been looking for
a place in the country.

396
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:11,790
Here, Jimmy,
hang that up.

397
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,460
Coathooks
are over there.

398
00:22:16,396 --> 00:22:19,098
I'm not
the butler.

399
00:22:34,948 --> 00:22:37,182
Would you gentlemen
care for some whiskey?

400
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:39,385
Not for me, thanks. I'd
like to keep a clear head.

401
00:22:39,386 --> 00:22:41,454
Aye, yes, please.

402
00:22:42,522 --> 00:22:44,257
Thanks.

403
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,262
Oh, we do have
cards already.

404
00:22:49,263 --> 00:22:51,564
Well, your house,
my deck.

405
00:22:51,565 --> 00:22:53,766
If it's all
the same to you?

406
00:22:53,767 --> 00:22:55,968
Oh, this is exciting.

407
00:22:55,969 --> 00:22:59,372
<i>It's so long since we've
had friends round for cards.</i>

408
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:02,074
Right... ante is �10,
under the gun,

409
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:04,209
there's a straddle option
to 40 quid,

410
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,211
<i>check and raise
is permitted,</i>

411
00:23:06,212 --> 00:23:07,813
<i>the maximum bet
is the size of the pot</i>

412
00:23:07,814 --> 00:23:09,882
<i>or 1,000 quid,
whichever is less,</i>

413
00:23:09,883 --> 00:23:12,885
the game's table stakes, the
minimum buy-in is five grand, okay?

414
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:15,888
Don't worry about me.
I'll try and keep up.

415
00:23:37,411 --> 00:23:39,345
What's going on?

416
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:41,079
Molly's new
business plan-

417
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,748
Glenbogle Casino.

418
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:44,350
Only don't
tell Archie.

419
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:46,118
I just came
to get us some food.

420
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:49,221
Help yourself-
to anything you see.

421
00:23:54,494 --> 00:23:56,962
That's not enough
for a growing boy.

422
00:23:56,963 --> 00:23:59,998
You need to keep
your strength up.

423
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,001
What do you have
in mind?

424
00:24:03,002 --> 00:24:04,670
Well...

425
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:07,172
there's a rave, up at
Glenmorrison at the weekend.

426
00:24:07,173 --> 00:24:10,175
And I was thinking
that you and I could...

427
00:24:10,176 --> 00:24:11,844
go and...

428
00:24:11,845 --> 00:24:13,846
get sweaty?

429
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:16,782
I'd love to.

430
00:24:16,783 --> 00:24:19,618
<i>But I don't know if it
sounds like Katrina's scene.</i>

431
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:21,620
Katrina?

432
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:23,622
Yeah,
me and her are...

433
00:24:24,891 --> 00:24:27,292
sorry, I thought Duncan
might have told you.

434
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:29,995
No.
No, he didn't.

435
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:33,866
Katrina?!

436
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:34,967
( chuckling )

437
00:24:34,968 --> 00:24:37,169
Gets about a bit,
that one!

438
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,137
I'm sorry?

439
00:24:39,138 --> 00:24:40,539
Oh, nothing.

440
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,842
Is there something
I should know about?

441
00:24:42,843 --> 00:24:43,976
<i>Or some... one?</i>

442
00:24:43,977 --> 00:24:46,846
Look! Forget
I said anything, okay?

443
00:24:46,847 --> 00:24:49,415
- Is it Duncan?
- Oh, please!

444
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:51,283
She has got
some taste.

445
00:24:51,284 --> 00:24:54,820
<i>Come on, Lexie, you can't go
dropping hints all over the place.</i>

446
00:24:54,821 --> 00:24:58,090
I just thought there was
something going on between-

447
00:24:58,091 --> 00:24:59,692
her and Archie.

448
00:24:59,693 --> 00:25:01,827
Obviously, I was
imagining things.

449
00:25:01,828 --> 00:25:04,196
Archie?

450
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:08,200
<i>Molly: Well, Hugh, I'll raise you...</i>

451
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:10,770
25.

452
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:14,840
And 50.

453
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:16,609
Murdo: See it.

454
00:25:20,514 --> 00:25:21,947
Any raise?

455
00:25:21,948 --> 00:25:24,082
Why not?

456
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:25,984
Another 50.
( giggles )

457
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:28,253
This is fun, isn't it?

458
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:31,624
See ya.

459
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:35,127
Queens and tens.

460
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,930
Aces and jacks.

461
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,002
Doesn't that mean I win?
( giggles )

462
00:25:44,003 --> 00:25:46,772
Gosh, I'm doing rather well,
aren't I?

463
00:25:46,773 --> 00:25:49,007
Beginner's luck,
I suppose.

464
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,554
Hmmm.

465
00:26:02,856 --> 00:26:06,058
This place looks
almost cozy.

466
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:09,027
You and Fergal have
done a fantastic job.

467
00:26:09,028 --> 00:26:11,764
Yeah, he's a good man
to have around.

468
00:26:11,765 --> 00:26:13,466
Yeah, he is.

469
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:16,502
<i>( sheep bleating )</i>

470
00:26:16,503 --> 00:26:18,236
Listen...

471
00:26:18,237 --> 00:26:20,706
I'm sorry about
what I said earlier.

472
00:26:20,707 --> 00:26:23,375
About you trying
to spoil things.

473
00:26:24,478 --> 00:26:26,311
I know
you wouldn't.

474
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:28,848
It's funny, no matter
how much coal I put on,

475
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:31,784
it never seems
to get any warmer.

476
00:26:31,785 --> 00:26:35,253
Maybe it's the spirit
of Kilfedder.

477
00:26:36,422 --> 00:26:37,890
Kilfedder?

478
00:26:37,891 --> 00:26:39,925
The man who used
to live here.

479
00:26:39,926 --> 00:26:41,894
He was the Glenbogle
matchmaker.

480
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:44,830
You mean this place
used to be a dating agency?

481
00:26:44,831 --> 00:26:46,431
Yeah.

482
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:48,133
People used to come
from miles around

483
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:49,835
to get advice
and find partners.

484
00:26:49,836 --> 00:26:52,437
But his family don't still
live in Glenbogle, do they?

485
00:26:52,438 --> 00:26:54,473
He had no family.

486
00:26:54,474 --> 00:26:57,676
- He never married.
- Oh, ironic.

487
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:02,748
There was a girl,
apparently...

488
00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:05,584
they were childhood
sweethearts.

489
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:08,453
But they fell out.

490
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:11,624
No one knows why.

491
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:13,592
Then years later,

492
00:27:13,593 --> 00:27:16,261
her father decided
to marry her off to a-

493
00:27:16,262 --> 00:27:18,597
rich Glasgow
shopkeeper.

494
00:27:18,598 --> 00:27:20,733
<i>Kilfedder
arranged it.</i>

495
00:27:20,734 --> 00:27:23,235
Even though
he still loved her.

496
00:27:25,572 --> 00:27:28,908
He thought
she'd gone off him.

497
00:27:31,177 --> 00:27:34,046
And he wanted her
to be happy, I suppose.

498
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:40,019
But it didn't
work out.

499
00:27:41,454 --> 00:27:43,923
Her husband
dumped her,

500
00:27:43,924 --> 00:27:46,158
and she died
in a poorhouse.

501
00:27:47,861 --> 00:27:51,229
They found a letter to
Kilfedder in her belongings,

502
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,532
and sent it on to him.

503
00:27:56,335 --> 00:27:58,604
It said she'd always
loved him,

504
00:27:58,605 --> 00:28:01,173
<i>and that...</i>

505
00:28:01,174 --> 00:28:04,577
it broke her heart
that he'd abandoned her.

506
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,952
<i>He died here.</i>

507
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:15,220
Look at me,
I'm crying.

508
00:28:15,221 --> 00:28:17,723
It's all
ancient history.

509
00:28:18,892 --> 00:28:20,258
Katrina, look, I-

510
00:28:20,259 --> 00:28:23,462
look at the year, 1901.

511
00:28:23,463 --> 00:28:25,297
I'd better go.

512
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,735
<i>I'll see you
tomorrow, anyway.</i>

513
00:28:29,736 --> 00:28:31,269
See you.

514
00:28:49,723 --> 00:28:52,825
Oh, look!
There he is!

515
00:28:52,826 --> 00:28:54,727
Mr. Total Recall.

516
00:28:54,728 --> 00:28:56,328
I suppose you think
that was funny.

517
00:28:56,329 --> 00:28:59,531
Sorry. Whatever it is, I've forgotten.

518
00:28:59,532 --> 00:29:01,533
Like you forgot
to tell me

519
00:29:01,534 --> 00:29:03,802
that Fergal was mixed up
with Goldilocks!

520
00:29:03,803 --> 00:29:06,005
You let me
ask him out!

521
00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:09,574
I feel about this big. Do
you know what that feels like?

522
00:29:09,575 --> 00:29:12,044
I should do.

523
00:29:12,045 --> 00:29:14,647
You do it to me
often enough.

524
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:40,472
Hector,
this is lunacy.

525
00:29:40,473 --> 00:29:43,142
Has Molly ever
even played poker?

526
00:29:43,143 --> 00:29:46,378
Once or twice.
Monte Carlo, Las Vegas.

527
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:49,114
She qualified for a
professional tournament once,

528
00:29:49,115 --> 00:29:51,183
but it clashed with
the Chelsea Flower Show.

529
00:29:51,184 --> 00:29:52,918
<i>Man: two.</i>

530
00:30:01,494 --> 00:30:03,228
Three, please.

531
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:07,166
Two.

532
00:30:08,802 --> 00:30:10,903
Two for the dealer.

533
00:30:24,684 --> 00:30:27,720
How did you end up working
for a creep like that?

534
00:30:27,721 --> 00:30:30,155
Not many openings
for hard men these days.

535
00:30:30,156 --> 00:30:32,657
And no self-respect
on the dole.

536
00:30:32,658 --> 00:30:35,560
Can you have self-respect
working for a guy like that?

537
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:37,930
I do an honest
day's work.

538
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:41,466
We can't all graft
for nice folks like yours.

539
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:43,869
So Murdo's honest,
is he?

540
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,205
He's a good card player.

541
00:30:46,206 --> 00:30:48,406
And he plays to win.

542
00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:51,443
Nah, he plays
to fleece people.

543
00:30:52,746 --> 00:30:55,513
I've never made anyone
sit down with him,

544
00:30:55,514 --> 00:30:58,650
but I've made them pay their
debts when they stand up.

545
00:31:01,087 --> 00:31:02,855
Raise you 50.

546
00:31:02,856 --> 00:31:05,224
Mm-hmm.
And 100.

547
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:09,361
Too steep for me.

548
00:31:11,597 --> 00:31:14,133
<i>Murdo: Maybe you should
pull out, your ladyship.</i>

549
00:31:14,134 --> 00:31:17,102
<i>You've squandered your lead.
Three grand down.</i>

550
00:31:18,604 --> 00:31:21,039
Don't feel
bad about it.

551
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,309
It's a class act-
"lady of the manor. "

552
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,278
Drew me in at the start,
but you see,

553
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,046
every time you bluff...

554
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:30,682
the corner
of your mouth goes up.

555
00:31:30,683 --> 00:31:35,154
<i>The "naughty schoolgirl" look
was a dead giveaway.</i>

556
00:31:35,155 --> 00:31:38,924
Well, some people smile,
Mr. Murdo,

557
00:31:38,925 --> 00:31:42,027
and some people talk.
Raise you 100.

558
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:46,531
<i>( chips clatter )</i>

559
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:50,002
<i>( chips clatter )</i>

560
00:31:50,003 --> 00:31:51,837
You think I'm bluffing?

561
00:31:54,307 --> 00:31:57,642
1,000.

562
00:31:57,643 --> 00:32:00,412
<i>That's your limit,
your ladyship.</i>

563
00:32:01,915 --> 00:32:03,849
Time for some collateral.

564
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:23,869
<i>( chips clatter )</i>

565
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:31,176
Full house.
Kings over tens.

566
00:32:37,116 --> 00:32:38,550
Aces on jacks.

567
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:52,630
You know, I'm not really
a pendant sort of guy.

568
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:55,934
But I do know
this lap dancer,

569
00:32:55,935 --> 00:32:58,436
it'd just fit
right in her navel.

570
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:01,773
<i>Looks like
we're quits.</i>

571
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,310
Unless you want a chance
to win it back.

572
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,948
Oh, great! If we can
both get started-

573
00:33:09,949 --> 00:33:12,317
actually, I wanted to
discuss my job description.

574
00:33:12,318 --> 00:33:14,353
Look, it's great of you
to help out-

575
00:33:14,354 --> 00:33:16,355
yeah, helping with
the croft, no problem.

576
00:33:16,356 --> 00:33:18,757
And the ranger part,
that's fine too.

577
00:33:19,993 --> 00:33:22,527
But I draw the line
at playing the schmuck

578
00:33:22,528 --> 00:33:25,097
for you and your
girlfriend.

579
00:33:25,098 --> 00:33:26,631
What are you
talking about?

580
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:28,700
I'm talking about
you and Katrina.

581
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:30,936
I'm talking about
this lover's charade,

582
00:33:30,937 --> 00:33:33,738
where you have me planting
trees, and she acts all surprised.

583
00:33:33,739 --> 00:33:35,173
We are not lovers.

584
00:33:35,174 --> 00:33:37,976
I'm not blind, Archie.
I've just seen you two together.

585
00:33:37,977 --> 00:33:41,846
Fergal, there is nothing
going on between me and Katrina.

586
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:45,150
We are just friends.
She helped me out with a grant,

587
00:33:45,151 --> 00:33:47,886
and the accounts, and she was
there for me when Justine left.

588
00:33:47,887 --> 00:33:50,122
- Really?
- And I helped her get over Alan.

589
00:33:50,123 --> 00:33:52,224
And how exactly
did you do that?

590
00:33:53,293 --> 00:33:54,993
You... haven't-

591
00:33:54,994 --> 00:33:57,562
no! We've never spent
the night together.

592
00:33:57,563 --> 00:33:59,597
Well, hardly ever.

593
00:33:59,598 --> 00:34:01,934
There was that one time
when the car broke down...

594
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:07,906
- it's a long story.
- Yeah, some other time.

595
00:34:07,907 --> 00:34:10,075
Thanks for putting me
straight.

596
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,279
Fergal...
what about the-

597
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,514
oh, brilliant!

598
00:34:19,052 --> 00:34:20,752
<i>Molly:
Just look at him!</i>

599
00:34:20,753 --> 00:34:23,688
Smug little slug
in a suit.

600
00:34:25,391 --> 00:34:27,492
Molly, this has
gone far enough.

601
00:34:27,493 --> 00:34:29,928
He's got my pendant,
the one you gave me.

602
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:32,264
Then the debt
is settled.

603
00:34:32,265 --> 00:34:34,699
Darling, let it go. The
pendant doesn't really matter.

604
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,201
It matters to me.

605
00:34:36,202 --> 00:34:38,903
I know he's cheating,
but I don't know how.

606
00:34:38,904 --> 00:34:41,306
Molly, this is not
about the pendant.

607
00:34:41,307 --> 00:34:44,509
Murdo wants you angry,
and desperate to break even,

608
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,445
so he can take you
to the cleaners.

609
00:34:46,446 --> 00:34:49,614
- Murdo ruined you!
- And I don't want that happening to you.

610
00:34:49,615 --> 00:34:51,816
You're at
your depth.

611
00:34:51,817 --> 00:34:54,419
Hector's right.
Get out now, please?

612
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,888
I suppose it would be
the sensible thing to do,

613
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,323
- I just wish...
- what?!

614
00:34:58,324 --> 00:35:01,460
I just wish I felt
like being sensible.

615
00:35:01,461 --> 00:35:02,527
Molly!

616
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:08,433
I'm really sorry
about this, Hector.

617
00:35:08,434 --> 00:35:10,102
Don't be, old man,
you did your best.

618
00:35:10,103 --> 00:35:11,769
Besides, she might
still pull it off.

619
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,638
Not against Murdo,
she won't, no.

620
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,773
<i>I'm telling you,
the man's a mind reader.</i>

621
00:35:15,774 --> 00:35:17,876
Impossible. I've lived
with Molly for 40 years,

622
00:35:17,877 --> 00:35:20,845
- she's still a mystery to me.
- Not to Murdo, she's not.

623
00:35:20,846 --> 00:35:23,748
<i>I'll tell you, he can see
things nobody else can.</i>

624
00:35:46,372 --> 00:35:49,741
I, uh...
I spoke to Archie.

625
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:53,111
He told me about
the two of you.

626
00:35:53,112 --> 00:35:55,347
Told you what?

627
00:35:55,348 --> 00:35:58,350
How you dumped
your boyfriend for him,

628
00:35:58,351 --> 00:36:01,486
that night in the road,
in the car,

629
00:36:01,487 --> 00:36:03,522
you know,
stuff like that.

630
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:05,223
Are you serious?

631
00:36:05,224 --> 00:36:07,859
Katrina, I saw you
and him together.

632
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,162
Doing what?!

633
00:36:10,163 --> 00:36:14,699
Look, whatever he's told you,
it's not true.

634
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,502
There's nothing
between him and me.

635
00:36:17,503 --> 00:36:20,238
There never
has been.

636
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:22,107
I want
to believe you.

637
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:24,576
Then do!

638
00:36:24,577 --> 00:36:28,680
Look, everything's changed
since you've been around.

639
00:36:28,681 --> 00:36:31,283
Things are so-

640
00:36:31,284 --> 00:36:33,385
open.

641
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,457
I'm tired of people
not saying what they feel.

642
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:40,492
Archie's so mixed up.

643
00:36:40,493 --> 00:36:42,827
I mean, one night
he came here to dinner,

644
00:36:42,828 --> 00:36:45,097
and was trying to say
something and couldn't,

645
00:36:45,098 --> 00:36:46,831
and then we
nearly kissed,

646
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:48,833
and I spilt
wine in his lap-

647
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:50,102
when was this?

648
00:36:50,103 --> 00:36:52,537
Oh, ages ago.
Weeks ago.

649
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:54,239
I'm sure he told you
about it.

650
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,373
No.

651
00:36:55,374 --> 00:36:57,342
He never mentioned it
at all.

652
00:36:57,343 --> 00:36:59,677
Fergal.

653
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:02,347
Fergal...

654
00:37:02,348 --> 00:37:04,048
three, please.

655
00:37:05,751 --> 00:37:07,486
Two.

656
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:10,822
Murdo: Stay.

657
00:37:10,823 --> 00:37:12,624
<i>Dealer takes three.</i>

658
00:37:21,134 --> 00:37:23,235
Can you open?

659
00:37:23,236 --> 00:37:27,172
Yes, I can-
for �10,000.

660
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:29,774
Ha! That's way
over the pot!

661
00:37:29,775 --> 00:37:31,843
If you're scared
to owe me that much,

662
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:33,145
I'll settle
for my pendant.

663
00:37:33,146 --> 00:37:35,747
You said yourself it
doesn't really suit you.

664
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:45,524
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

665
00:37:48,628 --> 00:37:50,195
Right.

666
00:37:50,196 --> 00:37:53,598
The bet is �10,000

667
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,800
on this hand.

668
00:38:01,807 --> 00:38:04,309
Full house,
aces on tens.

669
00:38:18,157 --> 00:38:19,491
Sorry.

670
00:38:19,492 --> 00:38:22,194
<i>Tell you what.</i>

671
00:38:22,195 --> 00:38:25,129
Double or quits.

672
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:47,586
I'll pay you next week.

673
00:38:49,488 --> 00:38:50,788
Stitches?

674
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:53,525
<i>( door opens )</i>

675
00:38:59,198 --> 00:39:01,666
Stitches, the lady's
trying to wriggle out

676
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,901
of her obligations-
oh, sorry-

677
00:39:03,902 --> 00:39:05,837
noblesse oblige.

678
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,073
<i>Stitches: The terms are cash or goods...</i>

679
00:39:09,074 --> 00:39:10,141
right now.

680
00:39:10,142 --> 00:39:12,777
Now just hold on
a wee minute.

681
00:39:12,778 --> 00:39:15,113
It's all right,
Golly.

682
00:39:15,114 --> 00:39:16,414
<i>Hector: well.</i>

683
00:39:16,415 --> 00:39:19,384
Time to settle up.
You'll take a check?

684
00:39:19,385 --> 00:39:20,785
I'm allergic
to rubber.

685
00:39:20,786 --> 00:39:23,788
<i>If that check bounces,
it's not my problem,</i>

686
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:25,857
it's his.
10,000, please.

687
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:29,227
- Made out to Mr. Murdo?
- Nah, just leave the name blank.

688
00:39:29,228 --> 00:39:30,695
Certainly.

689
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:32,464
Where did I put
that blasted pen?

690
00:39:32,465 --> 00:39:33,998
Oh!

691
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:35,467
You've seen
one of these?

692
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:36,901
<i>Frightfully clever.</i>

693
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,341
<i>Hector: I say,</i>

694
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:45,744
these cards of yours
valuable?

695
00:39:45,745 --> 00:39:49,080
Look, they're marked
with ultraviolet ink.

696
00:39:56,955 --> 00:39:59,391
After all
I've done for you,

697
00:39:59,392 --> 00:40:02,226
I should have known.
So much for nobility.

698
00:40:02,227 --> 00:40:04,396
<i>I'm taking my check
and I'm going.</i>

699
00:40:04,397 --> 00:40:06,598
I don't think so.

700
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:09,100
Suit yourself.
Stitches.

701
00:40:14,072 --> 00:40:15,573
Hey!

702
00:40:19,912 --> 00:40:22,246
U.V. sensitive?

703
00:40:24,817 --> 00:40:27,151
Very neat.

704
00:40:27,152 --> 00:40:29,086
Let's sort this out
later, shall we?

705
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:30,922
Let's not.

706
00:40:32,858 --> 00:40:36,894
On behalf of Mr. Murdo,
I'd like to apologise.

707
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:39,497
You'll all
be repaid...

708
00:40:39,498 --> 00:40:41,132
in full.

709
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:42,233
What?

710
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:45,570
It's bad enough

711
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:48,105
you've had me running
after you like your mother.

712
00:40:48,106 --> 00:40:49,774
I knew
you were trash,

713
00:40:49,775 --> 00:40:52,711
but I thought at least
you played straight.

714
00:40:52,712 --> 00:40:55,480
All of these people
will get their money back,

715
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:58,115
but what about
my reputation?

716
00:40:58,116 --> 00:41:01,085
Eh? What about
my self-respect?

717
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:03,888
<i>How are you going
to repay me?</i>

718
00:41:17,236 --> 00:41:19,103
Ah-ah-ah.

719
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:22,940
My car,
I believe.

720
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:24,709
How am I going
to get home?

721
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,644
Take my van.

722
00:41:26,645 --> 00:41:29,414
The rates are
very reasonable.

723
00:41:29,415 --> 00:41:31,148
Clear out, or I'll
set the dogs on you!

724
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:32,517
They may lick you
to death.

725
00:41:38,023 --> 00:41:40,358
( van starts )

726
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:48,332
<i>( van backfiring )</i>

727
00:41:54,373 --> 00:41:57,409
Hello, Archie. We've just had
a few friends round for cards.

728
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,411
<i>How's the cottage?</i>

729
00:41:59,412 --> 00:42:01,112
Cottage?

730
00:42:01,113 --> 00:42:02,447
It's a disaster zone.

731
00:42:02,448 --> 00:42:04,348
Oh... well, I'm sure
you're starving.

732
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:06,150
There's plenty of food
in the kitchen.

733
00:42:19,398 --> 00:42:21,232
( sniffs )

734
00:42:25,103 --> 00:42:28,105
Mrs. MacDonald.
Mr. MacDonald.

735
00:42:28,106 --> 00:42:29,808
You've a lovely house,

736
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:32,109
but you should take more
care of your possessions.

737
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,812
Yes, we will.
Thank you.

738
00:42:33,813 --> 00:42:36,714
"Kidnapped,"
by Robert Louis Stevenson.

739
00:42:36,715 --> 00:42:39,083
A rare, illustrated
first edition.

740
00:42:39,084 --> 00:42:41,553
Some dunderhead left it
in the toilet.

741
00:42:41,554 --> 00:42:44,055
Ah- right.
Thanks.

742
00:42:44,056 --> 00:42:46,090
The culprit will be
severely dealt with.

743
00:42:47,292 --> 00:42:49,427
Anyhow...
good night.

744
00:42:49,428 --> 00:42:51,228
Thank you.
And good night.

745
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:34,171
I am so stupid.

746
00:43:34,172 --> 00:43:37,509
<i>I am so, so stupid.</i>

747
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:40,411
( tearfully ) I nearly lost everything.

748
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:42,580
Only the necklace,
my darling.

749
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:44,148
You still
would have had me.

750
00:43:44,149 --> 00:43:47,685
Not that I'd fetch
as much.

751
00:43:47,686 --> 00:43:49,587
Oh, Hector.

752
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,817
Anybody home?

753
00:44:27,192 --> 00:44:29,594
Mr. MacDonald,
I'm Helen Reavey

754
00:44:29,595 --> 00:44:31,563
from the Council
Heritage Committee.

755
00:44:31,564 --> 00:44:33,397
Hello. I'm sorry about my appearance.

756
00:44:33,398 --> 00:44:34,599
I've been up
all night.

757
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,134
Oh, don't worry.
You know Katrina?

758
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:39,403
<i>- hi.
- so, this tableau...?</i>

759
00:44:39,404 --> 00:44:41,439
Yeah, please.
Please go in.

760
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,207
- Katrina?
- I've seen it.

761
00:44:50,082 --> 00:44:52,584
Fergal came round
last night.

762
00:44:52,585 --> 00:44:54,218
I know.

763
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:57,188
I can't believe you made up
all those stories about us.

764
00:44:57,189 --> 00:44:59,156
What stories?

765
00:44:59,157 --> 00:45:01,392
Maybe he got the wrong end of the stick.

766
00:45:01,393 --> 00:45:03,061
Yeah, right.

767
00:45:03,062 --> 00:45:05,162
I just told him we were
friends, that's all.

768
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:07,565
Well, then you lied,
'cause we're not.

769
00:45:07,566 --> 00:45:09,200
Well, what did you
want me to say?

770
00:45:09,201 --> 00:45:11,469
I think
I've seen enough.

771
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:14,739
Frankly, Mr. MacDonald, I'm surprised.

772
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,109
I was expecting a tableau
of life in a stately home.

773
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:19,744
Yeah, I'm sorry.
We had a bit of-

774
00:45:19,745 --> 00:45:20,878
but this...

775
00:45:20,879 --> 00:45:23,514
this has real...
texture,

776
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:25,583
<i>real atmosphere.</i>

777
00:45:25,584 --> 00:45:27,351
I mean,
you can smell it.

778
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:29,587
<i>- It does stink a bit.
- oh, no.</i>

779
00:45:29,588 --> 00:45:32,356
It just makes
the whole thing...

780
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:34,525
so intense!

781
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:37,996
If it was up to me, I'd
authorise a grant right now.

782
00:45:37,997 --> 00:45:40,464
Oh, that's great!

783
00:45:40,465 --> 00:45:42,166
What do you mean,
if it was up to you?

784
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:45,637
Katrina's the other
delegate, so it's her call.

785
00:45:45,638 --> 00:45:48,539
<i>So, what
do you think?</i>

786
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,708
What do I think?

787
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,746
I think it's not
just clever, it's cunning.

788
00:45:54,747 --> 00:45:56,981
<i>It'd fool anyone.</i>

789
00:45:56,982 --> 00:45:59,350
It certainly
fooled me.

790
00:46:00,485 --> 00:46:02,687
There you go,
Mr. MacDonald.

791
00:46:02,688 --> 00:46:05,957
That's what you wanted
to hear, isn't it?

792
00:46:05,958 --> 00:46:08,225
Ahem...

793
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:11,395
so if I put �5 to win
on "Lucky Straight"

794
00:46:11,396 --> 00:46:12,596
in the 2:15...

795
00:46:12,597 --> 00:46:14,766
and roll your winnings
over to "Dozy Bumpkin"

796
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:16,367
in the 3:30...

797
00:46:16,368 --> 00:46:19,603
and it wins... I could clear
5,000! That's marvelous!

798
00:46:19,604 --> 00:46:21,372
What are you two
cooking up?

799
00:46:21,373 --> 00:46:24,008
- Just a harmless flutter with my bookie,
darling. - May I?

800
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,845
I think we've had
enough harmless flutters

801
00:46:27,846 --> 00:46:29,480
for the time being,
don't you?

802
00:46:29,481 --> 00:46:31,816
These reformed gamblers,
they're so puritanical.

803
00:46:31,817 --> 00:46:34,618
It's not as if I've got
any money to put on a horse.

804
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:37,621
- Excuse me.
- Oh, Katrina, hello.

805
00:46:37,622 --> 00:46:39,724
- Can I give you this?
- What is it?

806
00:46:39,725 --> 00:46:42,560
A grant check
from the heritage committee.

807
00:46:45,297 --> 00:46:47,464
Don't you want
to give it to Archie?

808
00:46:47,465 --> 00:46:50,668
- Sorry, I have to run.
- Thanks very much.

809
00:46:50,669 --> 00:46:52,203
Ahh-

810
00:47:04,016 --> 00:47:06,383
let her go,
Arch.

811
00:47:06,384 --> 00:47:08,820
There's plenty more
fish on the beach.

812
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:34,145
Talk to me.
Just one minute.

813
00:47:56,969 --> 00:47:59,804
Like I said, son...

814
00:48:04,576 --> 00:48:06,778
you lose.
