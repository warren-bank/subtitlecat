1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,367
Hello?

2
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:17,104
What? Oh.

3
00:00:17,105 --> 00:00:19,272
Sorry,
I- I was, uh,

4
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:20,406
Just driving down.

5
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:22,442
I stopped
to admire the view.

6
00:00:22,443 --> 00:00:25,278
Ah, so you must have seen
the sign on the main road?

7
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,880
Sign?

8
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:28,014
Glenbogle Bed
and Breakfast.

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,383
Bed and Breakfast?

10
00:00:30,384 --> 00:00:32,285
Times have changed
round here.

11
00:00:32,286 --> 00:00:33,720
You'll be
our first guest.

12
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:35,188
If you're looking
for a room that is.

13
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:36,823
Yes, yes, I am.

14
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:38,825
Uh, Harold Xavier.

15
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:39,860
Archie MacDonald.

16
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:41,194
Archie.

17
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:43,396
I run the place, and if
there's anything you need

18
00:00:43,397 --> 00:00:44,597
During your stay,
just ask.

19
00:00:47,735 --> 00:00:48,969
I've put him
in the front room.

20
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,170
It's a bit drafty,
but at least

21
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:51,872
The ceiling's
not falling in.

22
00:00:51,873 --> 00:00:53,907
- Is that dish hot?
- It's warm.

23
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:55,575
Lexie, we're trying
to run a kitchen here,

24
00:00:55,576 --> 00:00:58,211
- Not a burger van.
- Here.

25
00:00:58,212 --> 00:00:59,646
<i>They're al dente, yeah?</i>

26
00:00:59,647 --> 00:01:01,848
Yes, I boiled them
for 40 minutes exactly.

27
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:04,251
- You what? Lexie-
- shut up and take it in.

28
00:01:04,252 --> 00:01:06,153
Right.
Right.

29
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:09,256
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

30
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:44,858
Here we are.

31
00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:50,263
So, you up here
on business or, uh-

32
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:51,865
Research.

33
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:53,533
This looks splendid.

34
00:01:55,236 --> 00:01:56,636
Everything okay
with your room?

35
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:58,471
I hope the mattress
isn't too lumpy.

36
00:01:58,472 --> 00:02:00,473
No, no, everything's fine,
thank you.

37
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:02,876
I couldn't open one
of the windows but, uh...

38
00:02:02,877 --> 00:02:04,945
Really?
Oh, I'm so sorry.

39
00:02:06,013 --> 00:02:07,814
I'll see to it
right away.

40
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:09,649
- No, it's no bother.
- Duncan!

41
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:18,391
The window in Mr. Xavier's room
is jammed. See to it, please.

42
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:20,927
Aye, right.
Of course.

43
00:02:20,928 --> 00:02:23,263
I don't want to put you
to any trouble.

44
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:26,099
Please, it's no trouble. You must
treat this place as your home.

45
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,101
We try to keep things
informal around here.

46
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:30,904
<i>- Thank you, thank you.
- Hector: Where in heaven's name</i>

47
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:33,974
Did that woman put
my dressing gown?

48
00:02:33,975 --> 00:02:37,077
- Father! - What is this female
obsession for constant cleaning?

49
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:39,045
Ah, hello there.

50
00:02:39,046 --> 00:02:41,581
<i>- Archie: You can't walk around like this.
- Like what?</i>

51
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:44,150
- Wearing a tatty old towel.
- What? Oh.

52
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:46,019
I do beg your pardon.

53
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,455
That looks good. Trout,
isn't it? Excellent.

54
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:51,124
Well, I'll go and put
some clothes on then.

55
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:58,298
I, uh... I see what
you mean about informal.

56
00:03:38,072 --> 00:03:39,339
Stark naked?

57
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,275
Apart from a sprinkling
of dandruff, yes.

58
00:03:42,276 --> 00:03:43,543
It's not funny,
mother.

59
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:45,611
Maybe if you'd just
given him some notice.

60
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:47,147
Who knows what he
could have managed?

61
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:49,549
I know he dislikes this
bed and breakfast thing,

62
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,118
But he doesn't have to streak
through the dining room.

63
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:55,088
<i>( Hector laughing )</i>

64
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:57,857
<i>Hector: Oh, MacPherson,
our so-called butler,</i>

65
00:03:57,858 --> 00:03:59,625
<i>Decamped in '73.</i>

66
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:01,995
<i>Wouldn't have minded but he
ran off with all the cutlery.</i>

67
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:04,097
<i>We were eating
with our fingers for weeks.</i>

68
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:06,766
<i>Xavier: And what about
your housekeeper Miriam?</i>

69
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:10,536
Oh, Molly.

70
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:12,872
<i>You remember
Harold.</i>

71
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:16,343
Mr. Xavier. I thought
you'd gone to America.

72
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:18,478
Just a flying visit.

73
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,413
25 years or so.

74
00:04:20,414 --> 00:04:23,249
- You haven't aged a day, Mrs. MacDonald.
- Oh.

75
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,252
Didn't recognize him earlier.
Had a beard in those days.

76
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:28,521
Yeah, and you
wore more clothes.

77
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:30,723
And young Archie
has certainly changed.

78
00:04:30,724 --> 00:04:34,294
Molly: Mr. Xavier came here years
ago to study the estate records.

79
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:37,830
- He's a genealogist.
- Watch this, watch this.

80
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:39,932
Farquharson.

81
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:42,602
Farquharson.
Farquharson of Invercald:

82
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:44,871
Finlay Mor,
standard bearer,

83
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:47,240
Fell at the battle
of Pinkie, 1547.

84
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:50,443
Francis, the "Baron Ban,"
led the clan at Culloden, 1746.

85
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:52,979
On the death of his grandson,
James Farquharson,

86
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,215
The title passed to
his daughter Catherine,

87
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:58,784
Who married James Ross
of Balnagowan, 1820.

88
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:04,724
Isn't that amazing? Keep him topped up
with malt, he'll carry on indefinitely.

89
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:07,828
Hector: So, what brings
you back to Glenbogle?

90
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:09,595
I've been asked to...

91
00:05:09,596 --> 00:05:11,864
Trace the descendants
of a particular clan.

92
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:14,034
I was hoping to have
a look at some records,

93
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:16,702
- If that's convenient.
- 'course it's convenient.

94
00:05:16,703 --> 00:05:18,604
They're conveniently
in the attic.

95
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:21,674
We'll get them down for you.
Not busy, are you, Archie?

96
00:05:26,914 --> 00:05:30,216
Doesn't genealogical research
include doing your own excavations?

97
00:05:30,217 --> 00:05:33,119
Nonsense. We're running
a guesthouse, Archie.

98
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,321
Can't have the guests
doing their backs in.

99
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,260
Marvelous.
Marvelous.

100
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:42,762
<i>Records for every local
family since 1770.</i>

101
00:05:42,763 --> 00:05:44,431
Who was Miriam MacKinnon?

102
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:47,033
Miriam? Our housekeeper,
20 years ago.

103
00:05:47,034 --> 00:05:48,668
Best one we ever had.

104
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:51,538
This case has got her name on it.
Shouldn't we send it on to her?

105
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,506
<i>Tricky. She passed away
a few years ago.</i>

106
00:05:53,507 --> 00:05:55,575
Perhaps you should
give it to her daughter.

107
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:57,077
Who's her daughter?

108
00:05:57,078 --> 00:06:00,045
What's her name? Firebrand,
lives up in the hills.

109
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:02,148
Katrina?

110
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:04,284
<i>Katrina: Won't party
headquarters be sending out</i>

111
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:05,585
<i>A search team
for you soon?</i>

112
00:06:05,586 --> 00:06:07,920
I thought I might write
my report up here.

113
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:10,323
Did you?

114
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:13,193
Katrina, I know you're
cheesed off about the ball.

115
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:16,196
Because you drove a flock of
sheep through the dance floor?

116
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:19,865
- Why would that bother me? - If it got
you into trouble with the Laird, I'm sorry.

117
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:22,569
I really didn't mean
to mess up your life.

118
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,537
You never do,
and you always have.

119
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:28,541
I miss you.

120
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:30,376
I miss the scent
of you.

121
00:06:30,377 --> 00:06:33,279
I just can't bear the thought
of you up here on your own.

122
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:37,183
Why, because without a man
my life has no purpose?

123
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:38,651
Oh, not just any man.

124
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:42,255
I'd better be
getting back.

125
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:44,690
The kids'll think I've
bunked off for the afternoon.

126
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:48,828
- I'll run you down there.
- I'm fine.

127
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:51,397
If you get bored,
there's the washing up.

128
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,047
<i>Duncan: There's more to
your man than meets the eye.</i>

129
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:10,216
Wish I could say
the same for you.

130
00:07:10,217 --> 00:07:12,852
That's no way to speak
to a duke, Lexie.

131
00:07:14,455 --> 00:07:16,556
Have you been out
in the sun again, pet?

132
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:20,393
That man Xavier, he's looking for
an heir to the Ballantine estate.

133
00:07:20,394 --> 00:07:23,229
I saw his papers
upstairs.

134
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,831
Archie: And you just accidentally
happened to read them?

135
00:07:25,832 --> 00:07:28,901
I asked you to fix his window,
Duncan, not turn his room over.

136
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:31,737
I couldn't help it. I
saw the name. Ballantine.

137
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:33,939
That's
my granny's name.

138
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,777
Oh, so that makes you Duke
of the Highlands, I suppose?

139
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:39,412
Maybe.

140
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:41,046
Eventually.

141
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:42,982
Before you head off
to the palace,

142
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:45,485
Could I have the keys to
the Land Rover, please?

143
00:07:45,486 --> 00:07:48,354
They're in his other cloak.
The one with the ermine collar.

144
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:53,493
- She needs new plugs, but you should be okay.
- Cheers.

145
00:07:53,494 --> 00:07:56,529
I suppose from now on you'll
be traveling in a sedan chair,

146
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,931
Borne by comely
and compliant maidens.

147
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:00,800
You volunteering?

148
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:02,202
You need to lose
some weight first.

149
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:04,604
Starting off
with that fat head.

150
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:06,806
Oh, go ahead, mock.

151
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:08,140
Don't worry, I will.

152
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,611
<i>Man #1: I've got every
right to them kids!</i>

153
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:13,379
<i>Man #2: You've no right to this at all!</i>

154
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,782
<i>- What do you mean "you"?
- You're a scabby old swindler!</i>

155
00:08:15,783 --> 00:08:18,084
You're the thief,
ripping off my ideas!

156
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:20,386
Archie. Mr. Pearce, Mr. Johnston.

157
00:08:20,387 --> 00:08:23,756
- We're here to see Hector.
- I'm in charge now. What's the problem?

158
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:27,460
- His goat raped my stock- - He's
trying to cheat me out of my kids!

159
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:29,662
- Right, one at a time.
- I keep goats.

160
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:31,997
There's no money in mutton
or wool these days.

161
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:35,801
- So my idea was to try goats' milk.
- Your idea?!

162
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:38,504
- Aye, and you ripped it off!
- Gentlemen.

163
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:41,374
So, Mr. Original here,
buys hisself a billy.

164
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,310
And last autumn he lets
it loose in my field.

165
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:47,247
<i>- It escaped!
- Covered six of my ewes.</i>

166
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:49,982
<i>And now he
wants the kids.</i>

167
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:53,253
So his goat ran off and sired
six kids in your flock?

168
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:55,888
- Aye, and half of them are mine.
- Over my dead body!

169
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:58,824
- Suits me!
- This is ludicrous. Just take it to court.

170
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:00,560
To court?

171
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:03,229
Aye and get fleeced by a bunch
of lawyers? I don't think so.

172
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,766
We're here for the judgment of
the Laird. It's our ancient right.

173
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:10,603
I may be the Laird, but I know nothing about
goat farming, and I don't intend to learn.

174
00:09:10,604 --> 00:09:12,705
<i>Now, please, just take
this dispute somewhere else.</i>

175
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:16,008
Somewhere else?

176
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:23,816
- Well, what was I supposed to do?
- Who knows?

177
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:26,085
<i>Those two have always
fought like rats in a sack.</i>

178
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:29,789
You think I'm shirking
my responsibilities.

179
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,492
You won't get rid
of them that easily.

180
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:05,325
I'm sorry,
you're in my light.

181
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:06,992
Oh, right.

182
00:10:06,993 --> 00:10:08,260
Beg pardon.

183
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:16,369
Can I help you
with something?

184
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:22,174
It's just that...
My name's Ballantine.

185
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:25,010
My granny's is,
I mean. Was.

186
00:10:25,011 --> 00:10:26,946
Really?

187
00:10:26,947 --> 00:10:29,014
Jenny Ballantine.

188
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:30,683
She won't be
in that book.

189
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:34,019
And why should that be
of any significance?

190
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,423
Well, I glimpsed
your papers upstairs,

191
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:39,058
A- about the legacy.

192
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:41,594
My research is supposed
to be confidential.

193
00:10:41,595 --> 00:10:44,497
No, there's no need to worry
about that. My lips are sealed.

194
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:48,234
It's just that... I thought
I could save you some trouble.

195
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:51,371
I could get her birth
certificate, my gran's.

196
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:53,539
By itself that wouldn't
prove anything.

197
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,908
No, honest, she was
definitely my granny.

198
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:57,677
No, no.

199
00:10:57,678 --> 00:11:00,847
It's just that with
a bequest of this nature,

200
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:03,949
I would have to correlate it
with other records.

201
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,085
Ah, I see.

202
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:08,020
Right.

203
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:08,954
Uh...

204
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:12,157
What sort of
bequest is it,

205
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:13,860
Exactly?

206
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,131
Where was she from?

207
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,901
Your granny.

208
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:24,103
Paisley.

209
00:11:24,104 --> 00:11:26,706
Inverness,
originally.

210
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:29,609
Go on.

211
00:11:36,884 --> 00:11:38,851
Hi. Oh.

212
00:11:38,852 --> 00:11:40,986
I was looking
for Katrina.

213
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:42,955
She's still at work.

214
00:11:42,956 --> 00:11:44,957
Were you planning
to move in?

215
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,493
- It's for her, actually.
- You can leave it with me.

216
00:11:47,494 --> 00:11:50,530
I'd rather give it to her
myself if you don't mind.

217
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:52,465
Then you'd
better come in.

218
00:11:56,236 --> 00:11:58,905
Archie: I thought you'd
gone back to Edinburgh.

219
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:01,908
I meant to, but the poor girl's
desperate for intelligent company.

220
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:03,643
Yeah, she must be.

221
00:12:03,644 --> 00:12:05,678
It must be pretty
cramped in here

222
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,179
With the two of you.

223
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,248
It is pretty cozy, yes.

224
00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:11,083
But we're used to it.

225
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:13,553
Can't all live in
a 20 bedroom mansion.

226
00:12:13,554 --> 00:12:15,955
They're a bit overrated.

227
00:12:15,956 --> 00:12:17,657
Yes, I know.

228
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,827
Lugging your own
suitcase?

229
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:23,062
I suppose you can't get
the staff these days.

230
00:12:23,063 --> 00:12:25,765
I just flogged my valet and
can't do a thing with him.

231
00:12:28,034 --> 00:12:28,768
<i>Katrina: Hello.</i>

232
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:30,870
- Hi.
- Hello, love.

233
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:34,507
Who's going to put
the kettle on?

234
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,646
I will. I doubt the Laird
knows his way around a kitchen.

235
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,817
We found this
in the attic.

236
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:46,719
<i>I think it belonged
to your mother.</i>

237
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,223
That's her
handwriting.

238
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:53,359
I don't know how it
ended up in Glenbogle.

239
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,762
It'll have to be mugs, I'm
afraid. We're out of Wedgewood.

240
00:12:56,763 --> 00:13:00,032
Not for me, thanks,
I'm not stopping.

241
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:02,134
Fine. It's more for us.

242
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:04,003
Archie,
don't mind him.

243
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:06,639
What's to mind?
See ya.

244
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:11,677
<i>( door slams )</i>

245
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:14,814
Does the Laird disapprove
of cohabitation?

246
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:17,116
Who said anything
about cohabitation?

247
00:13:17,117 --> 00:13:19,084
He might've jumped
to the wrong conclusions.

248
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:21,821
Did he jump
or was he pushed?

249
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:25,925
Yes, yes, his granny
was a Ballantine all right.

250
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:27,693
Her first husband
was killed at Dunkirk,

251
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:29,428
<i>Just a few weeks
after the wedding.</i>

252
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:32,965
Married again in '42,
Alex McKay was his name.

253
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:36,368
- A cousin of my father's actually.
- You mean we're related?

254
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:38,137
Around here
everyone's related, son.

255
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:41,507
<i>But it's not something to boast
about, if you know what I mean.</i>

256
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:45,144
- This is splendid. - Anything else
you need to know, just say the word.

257
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:48,180
No, thank you. No, no, this
is plenty to be going on with,

258
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:51,350
But I think I need another
look at the baptismal records.

259
00:13:51,351 --> 00:13:53,653
Anyway, thanks again.

260
00:13:55,923 --> 00:13:58,624
I won't forget this,
when I come into my inheritance.

261
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,760
I think you need to wait
to be crowned first

262
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:02,728
Before you start
dispensing knighthoods.

263
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:19,979
July, 1972.

264
00:14:21,414 --> 00:14:23,849
They couldn't
even have a picnic

265
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,919
Without staff waiting
on them hand and foot.

266
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:31,390
<i>Was pretty, your mom.</i>

267
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,760
Where's your father?

268
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:37,296
My father didn't
work on the estate.

269
00:14:37,297 --> 00:14:40,332
My mother married him
after she left.

270
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:44,704
- She kept a diary.
- Alan, leave it, please.

271
00:14:44,705 --> 00:14:47,539
What shabby little scandals
went on below the stairs?

272
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:52,745
<i>"Saw H. today for the last
time, up at the big house.</i>

273
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:54,981
Tried to tell him
I was carrying his-

274
00:14:54,982 --> 00:14:57,817
But Molly came in. "

275
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,487
Good grief, Katrina.

276
00:15:03,757 --> 00:15:07,026
My mother had an affair while
she was working at Glenbogle.

277
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:12,197
She became pregnant
with me and then left.

278
00:15:14,134 --> 00:15:16,102
And then she
married my father.

279
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:18,638
My dad.

280
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,240
"H. at the big house,"
who's H.?

281
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:23,575
Who do you think?

282
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:24,944
Now...

283
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:26,712
This is the interesting bit,
you see?

284
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:32,484
Now where did
I put it?

285
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:34,920
I don't know how you find
anything in this mess.

286
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:37,389
By using a cunning filing system
of my own invention.

287
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,858
Don't tell me,
it's all up here.

288
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:41,761
Ha, no, no. Nothing so
old-fashioned, my boy.

289
00:15:41,762 --> 00:15:44,429
All filed in order
of amount of dust gathered.

290
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,267
Yes, this is it. This is
what I wanted to show Xavier.

291
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:50,670
The Glenbogle MacDonalds.
They're all here,

292
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:53,438
From the infamous Red Fergus,
right down to the present day.

293
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:55,808
Excuse me.

294
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:58,678
I think there might be
one name missing.

295
00:16:08,655 --> 00:16:12,424
Remarkable. I had no idea
your mother kept a journal.

296
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:15,561
Katrina: It wasn't her
writing skills that struck me.

297
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:19,398
I always wondered why
she left so abruptly.

298
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:21,300
I suppose that
explains it.

299
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:23,803
- Hector.
- If you'll excuse me?

300
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:29,474
Welcome.
Welcome to the family, dear.

301
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:31,410
We must all celebrate.

302
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:33,445
Excuse me.

303
00:16:33,446 --> 00:16:35,815
Mother, wait. I'm sure
there's an explanation.

304
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:38,784
I'm sure there is, but I
don't think I want to hear it.

305
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,828
Look, I'm sorry.

306
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:50,996
To have a black sheep
in the family?

307
00:16:50,997 --> 00:16:53,165
Hector's the black sheep, not me.

308
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,434
You've got every right
to be angry.

309
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:58,604
I haven't even got to angry
yet. I'm still in shock.

310
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:02,708
- You realize what this means?
- Yeah.

311
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:06,011
That my parents lied
to me all my life.

312
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:08,180
You've got a brother.

313
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:12,818
Great.
Just what I needed.

314
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:17,589
<i>- And I've got another sister.
- And that bothers you, does it?</i>

315
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,259
Yes-
well, no, I mean...

316
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,861
It was bad enough
being an orphan,

317
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:24,930
But I'd rather be an orphan
than the daughter of a Laird.

318
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,568
I shouldn't be doing this.
A man of my position.

319
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:32,772
Listen, son, Archie's the
Laird. He scrubs out the toilets.

320
00:17:32,773 --> 00:17:34,740
Aye,
but Archie's skint.

321
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:37,509
Of course, I was forgetting,
you're heir to a fortune.

322
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,879
Why do you think your
man's being so secretive?

323
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,914
I'll have gold diggers
and debutantes

324
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:43,883
And all sorts
chasing after me.

325
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:47,519
- A terrifying prospect all right.
- Aye. The thing is,

326
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,156
I'd rather have a girl
who loves me for myself.

327
00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:52,958
There's a big lunatic asylum
just outside Fort William.

328
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:55,194
I was thinking of
somewhere closer to home.

329
00:17:55,195 --> 00:17:57,062
Like the big house,
you mean?

330
00:17:58,498 --> 00:18:01,667
Only I'm a bit skint-
pending the settlement.

331
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:03,502
Duncan.

332
00:18:05,672 --> 00:18:08,140
A man in possession
of a fortune,

333
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:10,309
Must be in want
of a wife.

334
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,145
Thanks-
you'll get it back.

335
00:18:13,146 --> 00:18:15,080
First rule of nobility:

336
00:18:15,081 --> 00:18:17,183
Never pay your debts.

337
00:18:19,786 --> 00:18:22,121
Look on the bright side-

338
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:24,456
At least you didn't inherit
their looks.

339
00:18:24,457 --> 00:18:27,526
- Do you think this is funny?
- Of course not.

340
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:29,628
I'm just trying
to cheer you up.

341
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:32,698
I think maybe you should
go back to Edinburgh.

342
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:35,801
- You need a friend right now.
- Aye, I do.

343
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:38,370
Someone to give you
objective advice.

344
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:40,339
What do you advise?

345
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,909
Look... You're entitled
to certain things.

346
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,945
Public acknowledgement
for one.

347
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:48,414
Do you think I want everyone
to know about this?

348
00:18:48,415 --> 00:18:52,017
Correct me if I'm wrong, but won't
it be all over the village by now?

349
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:53,919
That's it.
I'm moving out.

350
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,487
<i>You're not running
away from this.</i>

351
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:58,457
Look, that family treated
your mother like dirt.

352
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,960
Now's your chance
to make them pay.

353
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:06,265
A simple yes
or no, Hector.

354
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:08,334
<i>Even you could
manage that.</i>

355
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:10,936
Good god,
it was 25 years ago.

356
00:19:10,937 --> 00:19:13,172
I know it's terribly
vulgar of me to care

357
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:14,974
If my husband sleeps
with the staff,

358
00:19:14,975 --> 00:19:17,409
<i>But for some absurd
reason, I do.</i>

359
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,711
So, how many others
were there?

360
00:19:19,712 --> 00:19:21,914
Or does a gentleman
not like to boast?

361
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:24,149
I'm not having
this discussion.

362
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,885
<i>We are having
this discussion.</i>

363
00:19:25,886 --> 00:19:28,754
There is nothing to discuss.
What a man does or doesn't do

364
00:19:28,755 --> 00:19:30,622
In his own house
is his own business.

365
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:32,724
If you want to torture
yourself, go ahead.

366
00:19:32,725 --> 00:19:36,395
I won't torture myself, that's always
been your job, and you excel at it.

367
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:42,534
<i>( doorbell ringing )</i>

368
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:50,276
You see this?
You see it?

369
00:19:50,277 --> 00:19:51,843
It's attempted
murder.

370
00:19:51,844 --> 00:19:53,845
Try it again and you can
have the other barrel,

371
00:19:53,846 --> 00:19:55,347
You thieving beggar.

372
00:19:55,348 --> 00:19:58,951
Enough. That's enough. I told
you to take this somewhere else.

373
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:00,386
You call that justice?

374
00:20:00,387 --> 00:20:02,254
You call yourself
a Laird?

375
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:04,856
<i>Ah, you're no son
of Hector MacDonald.</i>

376
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:06,158
Right, that's it.

377
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,759
You want me
to intervene, I will.

378
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,862
Those goats are hereby
wards of the Laird.

379
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:12,464
What?

380
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:14,066
You don't try
to seize them,

381
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:17,436
And you don't try to dispose of them
without reference to me. Satisfied?

382
00:20:17,437 --> 00:20:19,204
How long
does that go on for?

383
00:20:19,205 --> 00:20:20,639
Until I say otherwise,

384
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,841
Or until you sort it out
between yourselves. Goodbye.

385
00:20:33,753 --> 00:20:35,754
Where are
you going?

386
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:38,023
- Going to stay with friends in London.
- Mother.

387
00:20:38,024 --> 00:20:40,426
I am not just an
appendage to your father.

388
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:41,827
I never thought
you were.

389
00:20:41,828 --> 00:20:43,429
Neither did I,

390
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,396
Till today.

391
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,995
Do you realize
that's 300 years old?

392
00:21:15,996 --> 00:21:18,563
- Sorry, Archie, I was just-
- practicing, yeah.

393
00:21:18,564 --> 00:21:21,233
You'll find it a bit different
from modern nobility.

394
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:22,501
Here.

395
00:21:22,502 --> 00:21:23,735
Chin down.

396
00:21:23,736 --> 00:21:25,304
Not so square
in the shoulders.

397
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:27,306
Frown.

398
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:28,707
Yeah, that's it.

399
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,609
All you need now is
the chronic overdraft,

400
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,544
The divorced parents,
and you're there.

401
00:21:44,124 --> 00:21:45,557
I suppose it's
your friend Geordie?

402
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:48,060
- I beg your pardon?
- That you're running off to.

403
00:21:48,061 --> 00:21:49,761
You've got a bloody
nerve, MacDonald.

404
00:21:49,762 --> 00:21:51,230
This business
was so long ago.

405
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:53,198
We are not discussing
vintage port.

406
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:54,833
Lies don't improve
with age.

407
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:56,101
I've never lied to you.

408
00:21:56,102 --> 00:21:58,337
Damn it, I'm not
that woman's father.

409
00:21:58,338 --> 00:22:00,572
I've no idea what those
journals were referring to.

410
00:22:00,573 --> 00:22:02,241
<i>MacKinnon was
probably deranged.</i>

411
00:22:02,242 --> 00:22:03,509
Thank you, Hector.

412
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,778
And now let's hope
that's the end of the matter.

413
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:09,081
But, where are
you going?

414
00:22:09,082 --> 00:22:11,216
Too little, too late.

415
00:22:13,453 --> 00:22:14,286
Too-?

416
00:22:18,724 --> 00:22:19,991
What more do you
want from me?

417
00:22:19,992 --> 00:22:21,193
Stupid woman.

418
00:22:28,234 --> 00:22:31,370
- Is everything all right?
- It's fine.

419
00:22:31,371 --> 00:22:34,639
I hope I haven't been
the cause of any discord.

420
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,309
Oh, no, no, no. Please,
it's nothing to do with you.

421
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,411
Just a- just a bit
of local genealogy.

422
00:22:39,412 --> 00:22:45,250
Hmm. Well, it's not always
a dry academic exercise...

423
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:47,286
Unfortunately.

424
00:23:02,335 --> 00:23:04,236
It's good of you to see us
at such short notice.

425
00:23:04,237 --> 00:23:06,405
Katrina is a neighbor.
She's always welcome.

426
00:23:06,406 --> 00:23:09,508
She's a bit more than a
neighbor now, isn't she?

427
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,077
Please, come through.

428
00:23:18,918 --> 00:23:21,052
Katrina has arranged to
get a blood sample taken.

429
00:23:21,053 --> 00:23:23,522
She was hoping Hector
might provide one as well.

430
00:23:23,523 --> 00:23:25,524
I'm sorry, I really
don't think that-

431
00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:27,692
It's as much for your benefit as ours.

432
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:29,428
"Ours?"

433
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,696
I'd just like to know
for sure, Archie.

434
00:23:31,697 --> 00:23:32,998
So would I.

435
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:35,367
But I'm not gonna ask him
right now, he's too upset.

436
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:36,668
<i>Well, I'm sorry
to hear that,</i>

437
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:38,637
But his troubles are
of his own making.

438
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:40,805
<i>Alan, I know you're
trying to help,</i>

439
00:23:40,806 --> 00:23:42,141
But it's not working.

440
00:23:42,142 --> 00:23:44,910
We really don't want
to go to court over this.

441
00:23:44,911 --> 00:23:47,513
You are not getting
a blood sample from my father,

442
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:49,080
It's out of the question.

443
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:52,017
- Fine.
- I'll give you one.

444
00:23:54,721 --> 00:23:57,422
If I'm Katrina's brother,
the tests should prove it.

445
00:23:58,591 --> 00:24:00,325
They might.

446
00:24:00,326 --> 00:24:02,227
I'll look into it.

447
00:24:02,228 --> 00:24:04,329
Alan, could you
give us a minute?

448
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,664
I don't think
you should-

449
00:24:05,665 --> 00:24:06,931
Thanks, Alan.

450
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:17,209
I suppose if you want blood,
you need a leech.

451
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,110
I'm sorry,

452
00:24:19,111 --> 00:24:21,446
But he's got a point.
We need to know.

453
00:24:21,447 --> 00:24:23,915
Katrina, if you want
to be part of this family,

454
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:26,485
Nobody's gonna
fight about it.

455
00:24:26,486 --> 00:24:28,820
Maybe I'll see you
at the doctor's, okay?

456
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,100
I thought you'd gone
to the House of Lords.

457
00:24:42,101 --> 00:24:44,135
Been down at my folks'
place looking for this.

458
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:45,970
Granny's birth
certificate.

459
00:24:45,971 --> 00:24:48,039
Proving my claim
to the title.

460
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,008
All I need now is
the coat of arms.

461
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:51,443
And what'll that be?

462
00:24:51,444 --> 00:24:53,812
Crossed wellies
in a field of neeps?

463
00:24:53,813 --> 00:24:56,615
You do realize you'll have
to curtsy to me every morning?

464
00:24:56,616 --> 00:24:59,918
- Says who?
- It's etiquette.

465
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,020
Could settle
for a small bow,

466
00:25:02,021 --> 00:25:05,023
- But you'd still have to call me "sir. "
- In your dreams, boy.

467
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,961
Of course, if we were man and
wife, you could just call me Duncan.

468
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:12,897
No, I think "sir" has
a nice ring to it.

469
00:25:12,898 --> 00:25:14,666
I've got something
for you.

470
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,801
What's this?

471
00:25:16,802 --> 00:25:18,837
The Ballantine
family jewels?

472
00:25:18,838 --> 00:25:21,473
Used to belong
to a millionaire.

473
00:25:21,474 --> 00:25:22,907
Gerald Ratner.

474
00:25:24,344 --> 00:25:25,711
Duncan.

475
00:25:25,712 --> 00:25:28,046
Will you be
my duchess, Lexie?

476
00:25:28,047 --> 00:25:29,615
Duncan, I can't.

477
00:25:30,983 --> 00:25:32,117
Why not?

478
00:25:32,118 --> 00:25:34,886
The thing is, um...

479
00:25:34,887 --> 00:25:36,855
You being a duke,

480
00:25:36,856 --> 00:25:38,757
And- and me being
a housekeeper-

481
00:25:38,758 --> 00:25:40,259
It just wouldn't work.

482
00:25:41,327 --> 00:25:42,927
Look at Hector.

483
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:46,398
- But- but you'd-
- holy-!

484
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:48,333
<i>( bleating )</i>

485
00:25:54,173 --> 00:25:55,607
Lexie:
Archie!

486
00:25:56,876 --> 00:25:58,209
Duncan:
Come here!

487
00:26:04,617 --> 00:26:06,451
Oh, for heaven's sake.

488
00:26:06,452 --> 00:26:09,388
<i>( bleating )</i>

489
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:10,555
<i>Lexie:
Shut the gate, Archie.</i>

490
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:19,331
What the hell are you doing
dumping those animals here?

491
00:26:19,332 --> 00:26:21,833
Apparently they're
the wards of the Laird.

492
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:25,404
You call yourself the Laird.
You can feed them.

493
00:26:25,405 --> 00:26:27,306
<i>Archie: They're destroying our garden.</i>

494
00:26:27,307 --> 00:26:29,308
Mr. Johnston!

495
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:38,684
You go this way.

496
00:26:39,952 --> 00:26:41,486
<i>Lexie:
Duncan.</i>

497
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:54,766
Come on, come on.
That's it.

498
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:08,413
Another normal day
at Glenbogle then?

499
00:27:10,082 --> 00:27:11,516
Where's your friend?

500
00:27:11,517 --> 00:27:12,851
Alan wouldn't be
much help.

501
00:27:12,852 --> 00:27:15,821
He's a bit scared
of farm animals.

502
00:27:15,822 --> 00:27:19,023
In that case,
I'll order some more.

503
00:27:19,024 --> 00:27:20,425
Are you here
about the blood tests?

504
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:23,362
Blood tests'll take weeks.

505
00:27:23,363 --> 00:27:25,296
I can't wait that long.

506
00:27:25,297 --> 00:27:28,099
One, two, three...

507
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,768
Four, five.

508
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:31,302
Duncan, where
are you going?

509
00:27:31,303 --> 00:27:32,537
- Hang on, hang on.
- Duncan?

510
00:27:32,538 --> 00:27:33,839
Oh. Ah!

511
00:27:43,015 --> 00:27:43,948
( bleats )

512
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,385
Oh, no!

513
00:27:56,962 --> 00:27:58,997
Could you take
a look at this?

514
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,402
Ah, this takes me back.

515
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:07,171
When was this? '72.

516
00:28:07,172 --> 00:28:08,573
<i>Katrina:
Where was it taken?</i>

517
00:28:08,574 --> 00:28:10,041
St. Michael's Island.

518
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:12,744
It's an old chapel
just outside Inverness.

519
00:28:14,313 --> 00:28:16,180
Didn't Miriam
look good?

520
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:19,217
She had an old friend
they used to visit up there.

521
00:28:19,218 --> 00:28:20,886
Joan McBride
was her name.

522
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:23,655
And do you think
she would know?

523
00:28:23,656 --> 00:28:25,824
Could give her a ring.

524
00:28:25,825 --> 00:28:27,526
Thanks, Golly.

525
00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:29,027
You're welcome, lass.

526
00:28:29,028 --> 00:28:30,295
Good luck.

527
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:36,435
- Any chance of a lift?
- Hmm?

528
00:28:36,436 --> 00:28:38,637
I can't do this
by phone.

529
00:28:42,975 --> 00:28:44,142
Archie:
It's the isolation.

530
00:28:44,143 --> 00:28:46,344
Same with all
these farmers up here.

531
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:47,979
They wander
the hills all day

532
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,981
With no one to talk to
but the animals,

533
00:28:49,982 --> 00:28:52,751
And every niggle gets blown
up into some Sicilian vendetta

534
00:28:52,752 --> 00:28:54,619
They want me
to it sort out.

535
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,321
You volunteered
to be Laird.

536
00:28:56,322 --> 00:28:57,689
I didn't volunteer.

537
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:01,225
Nobody's making you
stick at it.

538
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:02,928
I owe it to my family.

539
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:04,796
<i>Very selfless of you.</i>

540
00:29:04,797 --> 00:29:06,230
I suppose you
can't bear

541
00:29:06,231 --> 00:29:08,733
All those tenants
doffing their caps.

542
00:29:08,734 --> 00:29:11,002
I haven't noticed anyone
doffing anything, actually.

543
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:13,371
You needn't look so smug.
If you're a MacDonald,

544
00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:15,707
<i>You'll have to share
the duties of the Laird.</i>

545
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:18,777
- I don't want them.
- Tell that to these guys.

546
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:22,080
<i>( engine knocking )</i>

547
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:23,715
Archie...

548
00:29:23,716 --> 00:29:25,116
Why are you stopping?

549
00:29:25,117 --> 00:29:27,619
I'm not stopping.
The car's stopping.

550
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:35,694
<i>( engine cranks )</i>

551
00:29:37,964 --> 00:29:40,966
<i>( engine cranks again )</i>

552
00:29:40,967 --> 00:29:43,668
( sighs )

553
00:29:55,715 --> 00:29:57,048
Well?

554
00:29:57,049 --> 00:29:59,651
Well, this is
definitely the engine.

555
00:29:59,652 --> 00:30:01,152
Don't you know
anything about cars?

556
00:30:01,153 --> 00:30:03,354
Almost as much as I do
about goat breeding.

557
00:30:05,491 --> 00:30:08,292
It's only 8:00. I'll head
back to the nearest village.

558
00:30:08,293 --> 00:30:09,794
That's nearly
10 miles.

559
00:30:09,795 --> 00:30:10,829
Forget it, Archie.

560
00:30:16,802 --> 00:30:18,770
( sighs )

561
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,758
Did you bring
your toothbrush?

562
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:41,760
Ah, someone's bound
to come along soon.

563
00:30:41,761 --> 00:30:42,894
I hope so.

564
00:30:42,895 --> 00:30:44,563
I've got school
on Monday.

565
00:30:44,564 --> 00:30:45,931
Why don't you crash
in the back?

566
00:30:45,932 --> 00:30:47,899
Duncan's got
a mattress in there,

567
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,701
<i>In case he gets
lucky at a rave.</i>

568
00:30:49,702 --> 00:30:52,571
- And what about you?
- I'll be all right.

569
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:54,839
Don't be daft.

570
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,007
Come on.

571
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:20,065
Shall I bring up
another crate?

572
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:21,600
What do women want
from men, Lexie?

573
00:31:23,469 --> 00:31:25,336
Money,

574
00:31:25,337 --> 00:31:28,439
Security,
um, respect.

575
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,042
A nice, tight bum.

576
00:31:31,043 --> 00:31:33,444
Sorry, did you want those
in order of preference?

577
00:31:33,445 --> 00:31:36,380
Does fidelity
appear on the list?

578
00:31:36,381 --> 00:31:38,717
Honesty's in there
somewhere.

579
00:31:38,718 --> 00:31:41,185
You've never been
married, have you?

580
00:31:41,186 --> 00:31:43,521
You got well steamed
when you thought Molly

581
00:31:43,522 --> 00:31:45,123
Was fooling around
with that bookie.

582
00:31:45,124 --> 00:31:48,093
Oh, really, there's no
comparison. The man's an oik.

583
00:31:48,094 --> 00:31:49,494
And I suppose
this housekeeper

584
00:31:49,495 --> 00:31:51,563
Was a baroness
on work experience?

585
00:31:53,065 --> 00:31:55,066
I should have known better
than to ask the cook.

586
00:31:58,037 --> 00:31:59,270
Aye. Well,

587
00:31:59,271 --> 00:32:01,305
Here's another tip
from the kitchen:

588
00:32:01,306 --> 00:32:04,542
What's sauce for the goose is
sauce for the scrawny old gander.

589
00:32:06,979 --> 00:32:09,380
( sighs )

590
00:32:09,381 --> 00:32:12,917
<i>Katrina: Is it too late to do all
those brother and sister things?</i>

591
00:32:12,918 --> 00:32:15,954
- What, like camping out?
- And arguing.

592
00:32:15,955 --> 00:32:19,290
And slagging each
other's friends off?

593
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:20,859
- Like who?
- Like Alan.

594
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,627
How did you end up
with such a creep?

595
00:32:22,628 --> 00:32:24,629
He's not that bad.

596
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,931
And I haven't
ended up with him.

597
00:32:26,932 --> 00:32:29,968
- Really? But I thought
you were- - what?

598
00:32:29,969 --> 00:32:31,936
What's it
to you anyway?

599
00:32:31,937 --> 00:32:33,171
I'm your brother,

600
00:32:33,172 --> 00:32:35,573
I'm supposed
to look out for you.

601
00:32:35,574 --> 00:32:38,176
That'll be nice.

602
00:32:38,177 --> 00:32:39,110
Good night, bro'.

603
00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:41,680
Good night, sis.

604
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:44,949
Can you move
your elbow?

605
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,818
Ow! Damn it.

606
00:33:16,481 --> 00:33:18,917
( deep sigh )

607
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:38,536
Try now.

608
00:33:38,537 --> 00:33:39,771
<i>( engine starts )</i>

609
00:33:41,707 --> 00:33:43,407
Okay.
That's her.

610
00:33:47,512 --> 00:33:49,781
So when was the last time
you changed those plugs?

611
00:33:49,782 --> 00:33:51,783
Uh... Never.

612
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:54,018
I'm not surprised
she broke down.

613
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:55,653
But then again...

614
00:33:55,654 --> 00:33:58,189
Maybe you aren't
either, eh?

615
00:34:22,815 --> 00:34:24,649
Did you find her?

616
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,717
Joan McBride died
two years ago.

617
00:34:26,718 --> 00:34:28,452
Oh, I'm sorry.

618
00:34:28,453 --> 00:34:30,488
Looks like you've had
a wasted journey.

619
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:35,593
It was the only
photograph she kept.

620
00:34:35,594 --> 00:34:37,595
<i>It must have meant
a lot to her.</i>

621
00:34:43,135 --> 00:34:44,402
Come on.

622
00:34:44,403 --> 00:34:45,703
Where?

623
00:34:45,704 --> 00:34:47,105
Over there.

624
00:34:47,106 --> 00:34:49,073
You can't just
take a boat.

625
00:34:50,676 --> 00:34:52,143
I'm a Laird.
All my ancestors

626
00:34:52,144 --> 00:34:54,779
Were pirates and thieves,
apparently. Are you coming?

627
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,880
Yeah, all right.

628
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,028
Katrina:
Once you've seen me,

629
00:35:10,029 --> 00:35:11,896
You'll understand
I'm a better rower.

630
00:35:25,277 --> 00:35:28,179
It looks like
we're not alone.

631
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,081
The island
of lost souls.

632
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:40,124
<i>( camera clicks )</i>

633
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:48,266
- Mr. Xavier.
- Archie.

634
00:35:48,267 --> 00:35:50,335
You're a long way
from home.

635
00:35:50,336 --> 00:35:51,769
<i>Morning.</i>

636
00:35:53,305 --> 00:35:55,940
Ah, oh, ah...

637
00:35:55,941 --> 00:35:58,476
Crest of the McBrides.

638
00:35:58,477 --> 00:36:01,079
You'll note
the baton sinister.

639
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,048
Fifth earl came from
the wrong side of the blanket.

640
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:06,317
Is this something to do
with Duncan's claim?

641
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:08,887
No, that's all sorted.

642
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:11,256
No, this is more
personal history.

643
00:36:13,725 --> 00:36:15,559
Oh, sorry, this is
Katrina Finlay.

644
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,096
<i>- Ah.
- Mr. Xavier's a genealogist.</i>

645
00:36:18,097 --> 00:36:20,631
Katrina's doing
some research of her own.

646
00:36:20,632 --> 00:36:22,267
Only we haven't got
much to go on.

647
00:36:22,268 --> 00:36:24,668
Apart from...
This photo.

648
00:36:24,669 --> 00:36:27,372
- Oh, may I?
- That's my mother.

649
00:36:27,373 --> 00:36:29,941
We think she had an affair
with Hector MacDonald.

650
00:36:29,942 --> 00:36:31,542
<i>We came here
looking for proof,</i>

651
00:36:31,543 --> 00:36:33,811
<i>Only there's not much you
can tell from a photo.</i>

652
00:36:33,812 --> 00:36:35,113
On the contrary,

653
00:36:35,114 --> 00:36:36,781
You can tell
a great deal.

654
00:36:36,782 --> 00:36:40,318
Your mother's
not smiling at Hector.

655
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:42,987
She's smiling at the man
taking the picture.

656
00:36:42,988 --> 00:36:44,322
See?

657
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:50,528
- So who took the photo?
- I did.

658
00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:52,096
27 years ago.

659
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:57,168
You're...
Miriam's daughter?

660
00:37:00,339 --> 00:37:01,973
I didn't catch
your name?

661
00:37:01,974 --> 00:37:03,942
Harold Xavier.

662
00:37:03,943 --> 00:37:06,610
She used
to call me "H."

663
00:37:09,815 --> 00:37:11,282
It started
with a look,

664
00:37:11,283 --> 00:37:13,717
A touch, as we...

665
00:37:13,718 --> 00:37:17,221
<i>Passed in
the hallway.</i>

666
00:37:17,222 --> 00:37:20,458
It was intense.

667
00:37:20,459 --> 00:37:24,495
It- it was
extraordinary and...

668
00:37:24,496 --> 00:37:28,399
It was insane.

669
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,001
It couldn't last.

670
00:37:32,004 --> 00:37:35,906
I- I never dreamed
that she was...

671
00:37:38,877 --> 00:37:40,878
( deep sigh )

672
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:42,213
If it means anything,

673
00:37:42,214 --> 00:37:45,583
There hasn't been a day
when I've not thought of her-

674
00:37:45,584 --> 00:37:47,618
For what might have been.

675
00:37:53,192 --> 00:37:55,726
<i>I- I met
your father once.</i>

676
00:37:55,727 --> 00:37:57,828
<i>He was a good man.</i>

677
00:37:59,264 --> 00:38:02,166
Don't suppose you'd...

678
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:03,767
Need another?

679
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:10,608
It's just that I'd...

680
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:13,044
Like to make amends.

681
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:17,515
I don't need
another father, no.

682
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:23,754
But I'm a bit short
of uncles.

683
00:38:35,134 --> 00:38:36,800
You must be relieved.

684
00:38:36,801 --> 00:38:40,171
To find out that I'm a product
of a passionate affair

685
00:38:40,172 --> 00:38:42,640
And not the Laird's
bastard offspring?

686
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:45,743
- What do you think?
- I think it's great. Life's tangled enough.

687
00:38:45,744 --> 00:38:48,712
Without anyone threatening
your inheritance, you mean?

688
00:38:48,713 --> 00:38:51,849
You're also relieved because now
you can climb back on your pedestal.

689
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,717
My pedestal?

690
00:38:53,718 --> 00:38:56,054
And preach about how the
land belongs to the people,

691
00:38:56,055 --> 00:38:58,756
And how I'm corrupt and
elitist and exploitative.

692
00:38:58,757 --> 00:39:00,858
You left out
arrogant and smug.

693
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:02,927
I'm glad
I'm not your sister.

694
00:39:02,928 --> 00:39:05,596
Hear, hear, if it means we don't
have to go camping together.

695
00:39:05,597 --> 00:39:07,598
<i>( engine knocking )</i>

696
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:10,968
Archie.

697
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,847
You can have
the back this time.

698
00:39:22,848 --> 00:39:25,316
Don't be daft. Y
- you have it. I'll stay here.

699
00:39:28,787 --> 00:39:30,654
<i>( engine cranks )</i>

700
00:39:35,094 --> 00:39:37,228
<i>( engine starts )</i>

701
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:40,164
- What a relief.
- Yeah, certainly is.

702
00:39:57,549 --> 00:40:00,218
<i>- Duncan: What am I gonna do?
- There's only one thing you can do.</i>

703
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:02,786
Find out which goat it was, and
follow it round with a shovel.

704
00:40:02,787 --> 00:40:05,123
- Huh?
- Or else you could just come clean.

705
00:40:05,124 --> 00:40:07,625
Good morning,
gentlemen.

706
00:40:07,626 --> 00:40:08,959
You'll be
pleased to know

707
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,462
That I have
completed my research.

708
00:40:11,463 --> 00:40:12,896
I- I can get
another copy.

709
00:40:12,897 --> 00:40:14,332
Pardon?

710
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:16,634
The birth certificate
- it got damaged.

711
00:40:16,635 --> 00:40:20,505
There was an incident
with some livestock.

712
00:40:20,506 --> 00:40:22,206
He means
a goat ate it.

713
00:40:22,207 --> 00:40:24,575
Duncan, I don't
need to see it.

714
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,076
I have verified
the claim.

715
00:40:26,077 --> 00:40:29,280
Yes! Do you hear that?

716
00:40:29,281 --> 00:40:32,550
And I am delighted
to name you, Golly Mackenzie,

717
00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:35,319
<i>As the rightful heir
to the Ballantine legacy.</i>

718
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:40,758
- Golly?
- You pointed out yourself, you are related.

719
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:42,527
<i>He's the elder
surviving male.</i>

720
00:40:42,528 --> 00:40:44,662
The terms
of the bequest state-

721
00:40:44,663 --> 00:40:45,729
To hell with the terms.

722
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,098
Where's the doc-
where's the proof?

723
00:40:52,837 --> 00:40:55,473
Thanks to the information
you gave me,

724
00:40:55,474 --> 00:40:57,975
The bequest is
no longer in doubt.

725
00:41:03,615 --> 00:41:04,748
A lock of hair?

726
00:41:04,749 --> 00:41:07,185
From the head
of Bonnie Prince Charlie.

727
00:41:07,186 --> 00:41:10,254
Duncan: That's it? That's the legacy?

728
00:41:10,255 --> 00:41:13,357
Along with the honor of
belonging to the Ballantine clan.

729
00:41:15,194 --> 00:41:16,360
Oh, big deal, pal.

730
00:41:16,361 --> 00:41:18,162
<i>And of course,
the money.</i>

731
00:41:18,163 --> 00:41:19,630
Eh, money?

732
00:41:19,631 --> 00:41:22,533
Yes. The deed
of 1804 allows

733
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:25,536
For a grant of �30.

734
00:41:25,537 --> 00:41:28,573
And- and how much would
that be worth today?

735
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,843
Exactly...

736
00:41:32,844 --> 00:41:34,412
�30.

737
00:41:34,413 --> 00:41:36,814
Thank you.

738
00:41:36,815 --> 00:41:39,249
Now, if you'll
excuse me, gentlemen,

739
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,686
I am having lunch
with my niece.

740
00:41:41,687 --> 00:41:43,688
- Good day.
- Good day.

741
00:41:46,825 --> 00:41:48,892
Here.
Seeing as how you've

742
00:41:48,893 --> 00:41:50,528
Pulled out
most of your own.

743
00:41:51,896 --> 00:41:53,864
What about the m-
half of that's mine.

744
00:41:53,865 --> 00:41:55,999
I'll take it out
of what you owe me.

745
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,301
There's no rush.

746
00:41:57,302 --> 00:41:58,836
I'm gonna have
to tell Lexie that-

747
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:02,340
Lexie- Lexie!

748
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:04,141
I'm not a duke!

749
00:42:05,377 --> 00:42:07,278
<i>Lexie!</i>

750
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:09,113
Why didn't MacDonald
just tell you?

751
00:42:09,114 --> 00:42:11,349
Why did he put you
through all that anguish?

752
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:13,284
You've got a case
against him

753
00:42:13,285 --> 00:42:15,085
For mental cruelty,
surely.

754
00:42:15,086 --> 00:42:17,255
I don't have a case.
I'm not interested.

755
00:42:17,256 --> 00:42:19,056
Archie put you up
to this.

756
00:42:19,057 --> 00:42:21,091
Contrary to what
you seem to believe,

757
00:42:21,092 --> 00:42:22,960
I do have
a mind of my own.

758
00:42:22,961 --> 00:42:24,795
Fine, fine.
It's just that-

759
00:42:24,796 --> 00:42:26,497
What?

760
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:30,167
It was only a bit
of groundwork, that's all.

761
00:42:30,168 --> 00:42:32,136
What was?
What have you done?

762
00:42:32,137 --> 00:42:35,539
- I spoke to McClintock.
- The journalist?!

763
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,775
It was deep background,
off the record.

764
00:42:37,776 --> 00:42:39,310
You know
what that means!

765
00:42:39,311 --> 00:42:42,212
It means my picture all
over the Sunday tabloids:

766
00:42:42,213 --> 00:42:44,782
"spurned love child
of lusty Laird. "

767
00:42:44,783 --> 00:42:46,584
You've got to admit
it has a certain ring to it.

768
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:50,688
- Phone him. Now!
- It's not too late to-

769
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,627
Gordon?

770
00:42:56,628 --> 00:42:58,862
It's Alan.
Alan Smythe.

771
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,866
About that story...

772
00:43:04,035 --> 00:43:05,869
Yes.

773
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:08,105
Great.

774
00:43:08,106 --> 00:43:10,808
There's just
one minor detail.

775
00:43:12,477 --> 00:43:13,811
It was a hoax.

776
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,814
What can
I tell you?

777
00:43:16,815 --> 00:43:20,418
I know.

778
00:43:20,419 --> 00:43:22,820
I'm disgusted.

779
00:43:37,135 --> 00:43:39,570
Molly.

780
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:41,539
What am I going
to do with you?

781
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,841
Oh, I- I know it was
silly of me, but...

782
00:43:43,842 --> 00:43:46,677
I never thought a gentleman
discussed that sort of thing.

783
00:43:46,678 --> 00:43:48,145
Not even
with his wife?

784
00:43:48,146 --> 00:43:50,180
Especially
with his wife.

785
00:43:50,181 --> 00:43:53,150
I was embarrassed,
I suppose.

786
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,553
That you hadn't
had an affair?

787
00:43:55,554 --> 00:43:58,288
I mean, the Laird
is supposed to-

788
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:00,057
It's part
of his duties.

789
00:44:00,058 --> 00:44:02,993
Ordering the estate,
administering justice,

790
00:44:02,994 --> 00:44:04,528
Tupping the housemaids.

791
00:44:04,529 --> 00:44:06,564
Only I never
felt inclined.

792
00:44:06,565 --> 00:44:08,432
You're just
an old fraud.

793
00:44:08,433 --> 00:44:09,867
Well, the thing is I-

794
00:44:09,868 --> 00:44:11,869
I've never loved
anyone but you.

795
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:15,506
It's pathetic,
isn't it?

796
00:44:15,507 --> 00:44:18,141
You're, uh, supposed
to kiss me at this point.

797
00:44:19,878 --> 00:44:20,878
Aah!

798
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:23,447
Are you deaf?
I said kiss.

799
00:44:23,448 --> 00:44:24,415
I heard what you said.

800
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:26,183
Ooh!

801
00:44:27,986 --> 00:44:30,888
They've had half the shrubs, all
the roses and your dress shirt.

802
00:44:30,889 --> 00:44:32,823
They're not goats,
they're locusts.

803
00:44:32,824 --> 00:44:34,925
What the hell am I
supposed to do with them?

804
00:44:34,926 --> 00:44:37,695
That will take
the judgment of Solomon.

805
00:44:37,696 --> 00:44:38,863
Come on.

806
00:45:04,289 --> 00:45:06,323
Thank you for coming,
gentlemen. I wanted to-

807
00:45:06,324 --> 00:45:08,258
It's well for you, laddie.
I've got a farm to run.

808
00:45:08,259 --> 00:45:11,128
Golly: You do not interrupt
the Laird when he's speaking.

809
00:45:11,129 --> 00:45:13,631
Mr. Pearce... You were not asked to sit.

810
00:45:13,632 --> 00:45:14,832
Hold on a wee minute-

811
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:17,100
Hats off
in the Laird's presence.

812
00:45:21,139 --> 00:45:24,141
As you know, I wanted you
to take this to a proper court,

813
00:45:24,142 --> 00:45:27,110
But it seems you've
given me no choice.

814
00:45:27,111 --> 00:45:28,512
So with the greatest
reluctance,

815
00:45:28,513 --> 00:45:30,614
I've decided to take matters
into my own hands.

816
00:45:30,615 --> 00:45:33,517
According to ancient
Highland law,

817
00:45:33,518 --> 00:45:37,321
Any livestock that despoils
my garden becomes my property...

818
00:45:37,322 --> 00:45:41,224
- What?
- ... To dispose of as I see fit.

819
00:45:41,225 --> 00:45:43,461
I've struck a rather poor
deal with a Lebanese restaurant

820
00:45:43,462 --> 00:45:45,863
In Glasgow specializing
in barbecued goat.

821
00:45:45,864 --> 00:45:47,932
You're not sending
them for the slaughter?

822
00:45:47,933 --> 00:45:49,700
They're worth far more
as milkers.

823
00:45:49,701 --> 00:45:51,836
They're paying
me 50 quid,

824
00:45:51,837 --> 00:45:53,370
And I'm keeping the lot.

825
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:55,072
<i>Good day, gentlemen.</i>

826
00:45:55,073 --> 00:45:57,140
Now, wait.
Hold on a minute.

827
00:45:57,141 --> 00:45:59,743
It's a sinful waste
to slaughter them.

828
00:46:02,046 --> 00:46:02,746
He can keep them.

829
00:46:02,747 --> 00:46:04,414
He can have them.

830
00:46:04,415 --> 00:46:06,650
Better that than they all go to waste.

831
00:46:06,651 --> 00:46:08,452
I'm sorry.
I've made my decision.

832
00:46:08,453 --> 00:46:10,854
Please,
your Lairdship.

833
00:46:10,855 --> 00:46:13,056
I'm sorry about
your garden.

834
00:46:13,057 --> 00:46:15,392
I'll make good
the damage.

835
00:46:18,964 --> 00:46:21,031
Pearce can have
the two male kids,

836
00:46:21,032 --> 00:46:23,567
<i>Johnston keeps the rest.
Take them with you now.</i>

837
00:46:23,568 --> 00:46:25,168
After this,
the matter is closed.

838
00:46:25,169 --> 00:46:28,506
<i>- Johnston: Fine.
- Oh, yeah, suits me.</i>

839
00:46:28,507 --> 00:46:29,640
Thank the Laird.

840
00:46:29,641 --> 00:46:32,309
- Thank you.
- Aye, thanks.

841
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:39,617
<i>( door closes )</i>

842
00:46:40,852 --> 00:46:41,785
Yes!

843
00:46:43,588 --> 00:46:45,055
I actually
wrote a paper

844
00:46:45,056 --> 00:46:46,891
On ancient Highland
laws and customs.

845
00:46:46,892 --> 00:46:49,259
I never came across that one
about the grazing rights.

846
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,862
Oh, yes, an extremely ancient
one that I just made up.

847
00:46:51,863 --> 00:46:52,963
Ah, that would
explain it.

848
00:46:52,964 --> 00:46:54,565
Ah, Molly.

849
00:46:56,935 --> 00:46:58,235
Thanks for
everything.

850
00:46:58,236 --> 00:47:00,804
Don't leave it
so long next time.

851
00:47:00,805 --> 00:47:02,205
Hector.

852
00:47:02,206 --> 00:47:03,874
Everything,
uh, all right?

853
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:06,510
It's nothing, just a kick
from a temperamental mare.

854
00:47:06,511 --> 00:47:08,412
Watch it or I'll
kick the other one.

855
00:47:08,413 --> 00:47:11,615
Ah well, you mind
you take it easy.

856
00:47:11,616 --> 00:47:12,883
So long.

857
00:47:12,884 --> 00:47:13,884
Bye, Harold.

858
00:47:16,721 --> 00:47:18,188
<i>Harold:
Thank you, Archie,</i>

859
00:47:18,189 --> 00:47:19,389
It's been a revelation.

860
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:34,171
I'll see you, Harold.

861
00:47:34,172 --> 00:47:36,640
Ah.

862
00:47:36,641 --> 00:47:38,275
I'll write.

863
00:47:57,996 --> 00:47:58,929
Oh, I forgot
to thank him

864
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:00,998
For not ennobling
the staff.

865
00:48:00,999 --> 00:48:02,132
Of course.

866
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:04,501
It's bad enough dealing
with bolshie crofters,

867
00:48:04,502 --> 00:48:05,936
Never mind usurpers.

868
00:48:05,937 --> 00:48:08,005
Look, they asked me
to play that role.

869
00:48:08,006 --> 00:48:09,640
I only gave them
what they wanted.

870
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:11,441
Aye, but you enjoyed it, didn't you?

871
00:48:11,442 --> 00:48:13,143
No.

872
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:15,178
You're a good Laird,
but you're a hopeless liar.

873
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:17,047
You think
I'm a good Laird?

874
00:48:17,048 --> 00:48:18,983
- No.
- That's what you said.

875
00:48:18,984 --> 00:48:20,651
You're good
as Lairds go,

876
00:48:20,652 --> 00:48:22,519
But the sooner they go,
the better.

877
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,855
- Ha! You think I'm a good Laird.
- No, I do not.

878
00:48:24,856 --> 00:48:26,857
Yes, you do.
I heard you say it.

879
00:48:26,858 --> 00:48:29,392
- I don't think you're a good Laird.
- Victory for me!
