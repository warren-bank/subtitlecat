00:00:02,568 --> 00:00:04,536
<i>( wolves howling )</i>

2
00:00:05,871 --> 00:00:07,872
( growling )

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,069
<i>Archie: Don't forget, Dunc,
these are wild animals.</i>

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,840
<i>- they're unpredictable.
- Duncan: I always think how harmless they look.</i>

5
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,609
Reminds me of that dog my granny
had, great brute of a thing.

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,845
Golly: He's a west highland terrier.

7
00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:23,647
Yeah, but I was only a wee
boy so it seemed huge to me.

8
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:27,050
Harmless or not, these wolves
keep bringing the visitors in.

9
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:31,622
Golly, you know you should take
a leaf out of Duncan's book.

10
00:00:31,623 --> 00:00:34,658
Would that be his Beano Annual
or his computer game magazine?

11
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:39,162
- You can't, I haven't even read them yet.
- Show a bit of enthusiasm.

12
00:00:39,163 --> 00:00:42,299
If it wasn't for Dunc we wouldn't
have this party of naturalists coming.

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,969
This could be the start
of big things. Well done.

14
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,471
- I'll leave you to it, yeah?
- Okay, boss.

15
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:54,211
You see that? I saw an
opportunity and I grabbed it.

16
00:00:54,212 --> 00:00:56,547
No, son, the phone rang
and you picked it up.

17
00:00:56,548 --> 00:00:58,816
I've left my gloves
inside. You take the barrow.

18
00:00:58,817 --> 00:01:01,552
I'll finish up here then we'll
both get something to eat.

19
00:01:01,553 --> 00:01:03,353
Okey-dokey.

20
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,789
Oh, and Golly,

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,993
you've got to make hay
while the iron's hot.

22
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,573
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

23
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:34,911
Another spoonful of beans?

24
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:36,747
No, that's plenty
for me, thanks.

25
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:39,282
- Duncan?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

26
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:41,451
As long as you're
keeping your strength up.

27
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,453
<i>Lexie:
Lunch plates.</i>

28
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,256
Just toss them
in the sink.

29
00:02:46,257 --> 00:02:49,092
Did you hear about the
naturalists I booked in, Lex?

30
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:51,495
Archie says it could
be the start of big things.

31
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:52,962
I know, it's amazing.

32
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:54,664
You'll be tying
your own shoelaces next.

33
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,134
<i>Irene:
Were the fishcakes okay?</i>

34
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:00,504
Very nice, best I've
ever tasted in fact.

35
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:02,839
- You're just saying that.
- Absolutely not.

36
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,175
It's a rare gift you have with
the seasoning there. hasn't she?

37
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:09,446
Um... yeah?
I didn't really notice.

38
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:11,681
How could you
not notice?

39
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:13,683
I just whacked
the ketchup on and ate them.

40
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:17,220
- No change there then, eh?
- Go on, he's a growing lad.

41
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:19,890
- Anyway, it's time we weren't here.
- Another five minutes?

42
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:21,625
You can have
another five minutes.

43
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:23,727
I've got the feed
figures to do.

44
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:27,163
Oh, Irene, don't let him
take advantage of you.

45
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:57,461
Arch, did he find you?

46
00:03:57,462 --> 00:03:59,162
- Who?
- Kilwillie.

47
00:03:59,163 --> 00:04:01,998
- When?
- So you haven't seen him?

48
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:04,233
Not today, no.

49
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:06,803
( laughing )
I knew it.

50
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:10,039
- Lex, what are you talking about?
- Well, he's here again.

51
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,809
- Kilwillie?
- Yes.

52
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,512
- So?
- So, he made out

53
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:17,914
that he was coming to see
you, but obviously he wasn't.

54
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:20,851
So he was here to see someone else
and no prizes for guessing who.

55
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:24,988
Why don't I go back outside and
we can start this all over again?

56
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:27,591
He's after Molly.

57
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:30,927
<i>- After her for what?
- well, for anything he can get.</i>

58
00:04:32,763 --> 00:04:35,198
Oh!
He fancies her, Arch.

59
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:40,704
Ah!

60
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:44,273
- You almost had me there.
- I'm being serious.

61
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:46,409
Yeah, of course you are.

62
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:00,757
( horn honking )

63
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:18,141
Welcome to Glenbogle.

64
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:22,245
- Lovely spot. Secluded, too.
- It'll suit then?

65
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:24,548
It's perfect.
Sorry, you're...?

66
00:05:24,549 --> 00:05:27,283
Duncan,
campsite manager.

67
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:29,185
- I'm Ian.
- Hello.

68
00:05:29,186 --> 00:05:30,720
- Gail.
- Hello.

69
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:34,024
<i>- And this is our daughter Heather.
- hello.</i>

70
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:36,426
<i>Ian: It's good of you to have us.</i>

71
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:38,094
There's lots
of places won't.

72
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:41,064
<i>- why's that then?
- Think we're a bit strange.</i>

73
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:44,100
- I don't understand.
- No, neither do we.

74
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:48,271
So, are you in tune with
nature yourself, Duncan?

75
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:50,206
Every chance I can get.

76
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,876
<i>Ian: Which must be quite
often I would imagine,</i>

77
00:05:52,877 --> 00:05:55,278
living and working
in a place like this.

78
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,314
Well, you know, it's one of
the reasons I love the job.

79
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:00,450
You get so much time...

80
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:02,719
outside.

81
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,487
And work uninhibited.

82
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:06,623
I'd say I was pretty
much my own boss, yes.

83
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:08,892
Heather: I'd say you're
all as sad as each other.

84
00:06:08,893 --> 00:06:10,727
Because I like what I do?

85
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:12,428
Because you have
to boast about it.

86
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:14,263
<i>Ian:
Take no notice,</i>

87
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:17,233
this is just because we wouldn't
let her stay at home by herself.

88
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:18,802
<i>Listen,
once we're settled,</i>

89
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:21,370
come back and have
a drink and a proper chat.

90
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:24,608
- Are you sure?
- I insist.

91
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:27,077
It's always nice to meet
a fellow enthusiast.

92
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:29,545
And if you'd like
to see the wildlife center,

93
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:32,381
<i>- then I'm your man.
- Ian: thanks for the offer,</i>

94
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:34,851
but I think it's best
if we stay out of the way.

95
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,487
It's no trouble,
honestly.

96
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:45,829
<i>Gail: Now that's what
I call open-minded.</i>

97
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,132
Aye, I wish we'd found
this place years ago.

98
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:04,080
Yes, this call came right out
of the blue from Stinky Perkins.

99
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:07,617
He's a very old chum of
mine, disgustingly rich.

100
00:07:07,618 --> 00:07:09,986
He's bought himself
a villa

101
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:12,389
<i>just outside a little
greek fishing village.</i>

102
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,791
<i>Anyway, here's the nub,</i>

103
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:18,028
<i>I can have the run of the
place whenever the fancy takes.</i>

104
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:20,297
Lucky old you.

105
00:07:20,298 --> 00:07:23,633
Nice bit of Mediterranean sunshine
will do you a power of good.

106
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:26,169
( stuttering )
I was just wondering

107
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,238
if you might like
a little break?

108
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:31,707
That's very
thoughtful of you

109
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,276
but he's your friend,
you must go.

110
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:35,946
Well...

111
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:38,048
I was thinking
both of us together.

112
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:42,285
Well not
together-together.

113
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:45,355
Everything
above board, naturally.

114
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:50,760
So, does the idea
appeal- at all?

115
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,297
Well, it would
be lovely.

116
00:07:54,298 --> 00:07:56,933
Marvelous! Let's synchronize
diaries then, shall we?

117
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,836
The thing is, though, I can't
leave Glenbogle at the moment.

118
00:07:59,837 --> 00:08:02,172
<i>There is so much
going on.</i>

119
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:04,707
Perhaps another time.

120
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:09,245
I see.
Quite understand.

121
00:08:09,246 --> 00:08:12,182
I'll tell stinky
"no" then.

122
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:14,951
You could still go though.

123
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,053
No. it wouldn't
be the same.

124
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:21,024
Besides, if it's
getting a bit hectic,

125
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:23,426
you never know when
you might need me.

126
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:39,809
What?

127
00:08:41,245 --> 00:08:43,813
I think you were right.

128
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:47,117
I usually am. About
anything specifically?

129
00:08:47,118 --> 00:08:50,520
Kilwillie making
advances to my mother.

130
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:52,889
He's only gone and asked
her on some exotic holiday.

131
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,824
Well that might be
what she needs.

132
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,060
It's exactly what
she doesn't need.

133
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:58,628
Anyway, she said no.

134
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:01,498
- So what's the problem?
- I'm not having it.

135
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,267
Neither's Kilwillie,
by the sounds of things.

136
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,371
I'm going to have
a word with him.

137
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:10,507
My mother
is out of bounds.

138
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,843
Archie, she's got a lot
of years ahead of her.

139
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,579
You can't expect her
to spend them alone.


140
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:28,491
Hi, it's me, Duncan.

141
00:09:28,492 --> 00:09:30,260
Hello there.
Come on in.

142
00:09:30,261 --> 00:09:32,262
I'll come back
when you're dressed.

143
00:09:32,263 --> 00:09:35,598
- How do you mean?
- You haven't got your shirt on.

144
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:38,034
I haven't got anything
on, have we, darling?

145
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,503
Just my flip-flops.

146
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:43,973
Have you lost
your luggage?

147
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:45,808
No.

148
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:47,610
You've been for a swim?

149
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:50,846
This is how we unwind.
But you knew that.

150
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,285
You are the naturalists?

151
00:09:55,286 --> 00:09:57,454
Close.

152
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:59,222
<i>We're naturists.</i>

153
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:03,259
You mean you...

154
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,696
walk around...
in the bufty?

155
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,133
You can't.

156
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:12,402
Oh, I think you'll
find we can.

157
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,004
- Fancy a beer?
- Ah!

158
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:17,873
( whimpering )

159
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:29,619
Kilwillie?

160
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,388
- You wanted to see me?
- Did I?

161
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:35,024
According to Lexie.

162
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:37,893
- Oh, yes.
- So, what is it?

163
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:40,930
( stammering )
It was just the-

164
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,568
the Landowners Association
annual dinner.

165
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:48,204
I was just wondering how
many tickets you might need.

166
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:50,840
- That's months away.
- Best to get in early.

167
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:53,909
Which is why there were only
seven of us at the last one.

168
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,315
I'll put you down as a
"don't know" then, shall I?

169
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:06,856
It's the most natural
thing in the world, Duncan,

170
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:10,593
letting your body
soak up the sun's rays.

171
00:11:10,594 --> 00:11:12,828
I'm not sure
that it's for me.

172
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:15,532
I can promise you,
there's nothing like it.

173
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,567
I think you'll be seeing
more of us up here

174
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:19,402
once I start spreading
the word.

175
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:21,538
- What word?
- Suitability.

176
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:23,373
I'm president
of the Highland

177
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:25,475
and Western Isles
Naturist Society

178
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,077
so I always like to check
out a new site first.

179
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,548
But Glenbogle gets
the big thumbs up so far.

180
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:33,383
<i>You got the sun cream
out there, dad?</i>

181
00:11:33,384 --> 00:11:34,750
Aye, come and join us.

182
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:36,553
Is that your daughter?

183
00:11:36,554 --> 00:11:39,189
Very careful not to
get burnt. Here she is.

184
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:45,461
But you've got
your clothes on.

185
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:47,397
Sorry to
disappoint you.

186
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:50,733
No, no, I just mean
what with the sun cream.

187
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:54,136
My arms. Not feeling the
urge to get them off then?

188
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:57,139
I was just explaining about
the benefits of the lifestyle.

189
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,841
That's not what
I'd call them.

190
00:11:58,842 --> 00:12:01,611
I thought you were one
of the great undressed anyway.

191
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:03,279
Misunderstanding.

192
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,748
What, you mean you're
normal? Thank goodness.

193
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,624
Hello!

194
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:17,860
Hello yourself.

195
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,862
Hi, Lexie.

196
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:22,097
There's no need
to look so disappointed.

197
00:12:22,098 --> 00:12:24,266
I was not.

198
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:26,268
So, was it Irene
you were after?

199
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:28,103
Maybe.

200
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:30,906
You know if I didn't
know any better,

201
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:32,875
I would say you
were soft on her.

202
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:35,110
I am no such thing.

203
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:38,013
<i>- If you say so.
- yes, I do.</i>

204
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:41,417
<i>You know she's
a fine-looking woman.</i>

205
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:44,620
That is as may be, Lexie,
but that doesn't mean...

206
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:46,789
I know.

207
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,992
I just think you'd be good
for each other, that's all.

208
00:12:49,993 --> 00:12:53,596
But, it's none
of my business.

209
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:32,234
It's inspiring,
isn't it?

210
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:35,137
Mmm, it is.

211
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:37,507
I've found the answer
to many a problem

212
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:39,942
just looking out
over the water.

213
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:41,711
Is that what
you're doing now?

214
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:44,614
<i>Seeking solutions?</i>

215
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,049
More guidance, really.

216
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,985
Not for myself, mind,
but... a friend.

217
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:54,990
Can I help?

218
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:56,992
Maybe.

219
00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:59,429
He- this friend
of mine,

220
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,298
he's reached
a certain age.

221
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,233
Haven't we all?

222
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:07,169
There's nothing we can
do about it, I'm afraid.

223
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,005
No, but the thing is
that there's a-

224
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:13,476
there's a woman
that he's become fond of.

225
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:17,146
Has he told her?

226
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,315
No, no.
Not in so many words.

227
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,051
Just bought her flowers,
that sort of thing.

228
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,891
This chap,
would I know him?

229
00:14:28,892 --> 00:14:32,227
It's not beyond the
realms of possibility, no.

230
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:36,031
Anyway,
he's asking himself

231
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:39,702
is he too old to be

232
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:41,871
<i>considering
a relationship.</i>

233
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,240
And how would you
advise him?

234
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:47,009
<i>Well...</i>

235
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,846
I think I'll be
telling him-

236
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:54,650
I think I'll be telling him
that it is never too late.

237
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,754
What would you say?

238
00:14:58,755 --> 00:15:02,024
I agree.
Absolutely.

239
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:05,795
Good.

240
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:07,363
Excellent.

241
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,646
( chatting )

242
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:46,569
<i>- ( growls )
- ( Lexie screams )</i>

243
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:54,244
( growls )

244
00:15:59,316 --> 00:16:01,450
Hey!

245
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:04,553
Found yourself
a new friend then?

246
00:16:04,554 --> 00:16:06,890
- Eh?
- A young girl.

247
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:09,425
<i>- Oh, Heather.
- first name terms already.</i>

248
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,727
I was just being chatty.

249
00:16:11,728 --> 00:16:14,297
Oh, really?

250
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:15,965
She's from
the campsite.

251
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:19,535
- Perhaps you might like
to introduce me. - Oh- that-

252
00:16:19,536 --> 00:16:22,272
perhaps that wouldn't be
a great idea, probably.

253
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,740
You wouldn't have anything
to hide, would you?

254
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:27,043
How are the naturalists?
Settled in all right?

255
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:29,345
He made sure they got
a very warm welcome.
256
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:31,747
Well, one of them
anyway.

257
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,886
Actually, there are a couple
of things we should talk about.

258
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:38,922
They haven't got
any complaints have they?

259
00:16:38,923 --> 00:16:41,424
Them? No, everything's perfect for them.

260
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:43,092
That's all that matters,
isn't it?

261
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:45,128
Exactly.
Apart from-

262
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,796
whatever you're doing,
stop it.

263
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,332
This is more important.
Come on.

264
00:16:53,603 --> 00:16:56,205
<i>Archie: That's impossible,
one can't have got out.</i>

265
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:58,607
- I only knew what I saw.
- Maybe it was a dog.

266
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:02,511
Maybe, but it must
have been a pretty big one.

267
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:05,581
You've been in there today so the
enclosure must have been opened.

268
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:08,284
- Yeah.
- Well, did you lock it properly?

269
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:11,887
Yeah, course I did. Well,
actually, I left Golly and Duncan-

270
00:17:15,092 --> 00:17:17,060
Golly,

271
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:21,297
you know how some people
get on with certain people

272
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:25,068
better than
other people?

273
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:28,104
Would these be
any people in particular?

274
00:17:28,105 --> 00:17:31,674
Well, Irene,
for example.

275
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,777
- Irene and-
- and?

276
00:17:34,778 --> 00:17:37,013
- And-
- another person?

277
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,316
- Exactly.
- Why don't you just come out and say it?

278
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:42,952
Well, yes,
but the thing is-

279
00:17:42,953 --> 00:17:46,356
you think I should
say something to her?

280
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,790
- Yes.
- Yes?

281
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,059
- No. no.
- No?

282
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,129
<i>- Archie: I thought I could trust you two!
- What do you mean?</i>

283
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,732
It looks like one of the wolves
has escaped from the enclosure.

284
00:17:56,733 --> 00:18:00,003
- That'll be my fault.
- I left both of you to take care of it.

285
00:18:00,004 --> 00:18:02,138
<i>Golly: There's no need
to go blaming Duncan.</i>

286
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:03,873
I had to go back inside.
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,310
It's a bit late for that. We could
have a situation on our hands.

288
00:18:07,311 --> 00:18:09,145
Are you sure one
of them is missing?

289
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:11,414
Does anybody know why
these are all over the lawn?

290
00:18:11,415 --> 00:18:13,316
I think that answers
your question.

291
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:15,651
Look, there's no good
in going after it now,

292
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:18,921
we'll lose the light in half
an hour. We'd have no chance.

293
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:21,090
First light then. Let's
hope it's not too late.

294
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:24,894
- But that means it'll be out there all night.
- Just make sure you're not.

295
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,796
We'll evacuate the naturalists
camp. I'll have a word with them.

296
00:18:27,797 --> 00:18:29,499
What are you going
to say to them?

297
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,866
I don't know-
poachers.

298
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:33,136
We've got a band of
poachers, armed and dangerous.

299
00:18:33,137 --> 00:18:35,571
No, I'll do it.

300
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,473
After all,
like you said,

301
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:39,608
they're my
responsibility.

302
00:18:49,286 --> 00:18:51,320
Dunc, we'll get
this wolf back.

303
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:54,123
It'll be too late by then.
Everything's going wrong.

304
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:56,059
And they were
my big chance.

305
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,161
- Who?
- The naturalists.

306
00:18:58,162 --> 00:19:01,630
Only they're not naturalists
because, well, they're something else.

307
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:04,667
- And on top of that I haven't told Golly yet.
- Told Golly what?

308
00:19:06,002 --> 00:19:09,205
If I tell you and you
tell somebody else,

309
00:19:09,206 --> 00:19:11,307
I'd have to kill you.

310
00:19:11,308 --> 00:19:14,643
Oh, so it's really
serious then, eh?

311
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:16,345
I'm seeing someone.

312
00:19:16,346 --> 00:19:18,847
Oh, that's good,
Duncan.

313
00:19:18,848 --> 00:19:22,452
- It's Irene.
- Oh, not so good.

314
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,521
You do know how
Golly feels about her?

315
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:28,023
Oh, and I've been
encouraging him.

316
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:31,827
- What am I gonna do?
- You need to talk to him.

317
00:19:31,828 --> 00:19:35,931
- I've tried.
- Try a bit harder.

318
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:39,168
Aye, but I've got to see
these naturalists first.

319
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,649
<i>Ian:
Hello there.</i>

320
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,585
Can I help you?

321
00:20:10,534 --> 00:20:12,468
<i>( bird crying )</i>

322
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,716
Duncan, what are you
doing behind here?

323
00:20:31,155 --> 00:20:34,323
I just heard a noise,
checking it out.

324
00:20:34,324 --> 00:20:36,259
Not hiding then?

325
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,694
<i>- Why would I be?
- so I don't catch you</i>

326
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,430
sneaking down to see
your little girlfriend.

327
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:44,600
She's not my-
you are.

328
00:20:44,601 --> 00:20:47,670
And you wouldn't keep
anything from me, would you?

329
00:20:47,671 --> 00:20:49,838
Like what?

330
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:52,642
Like the fact that they're
prancing around without clothes on.

331
00:20:52,643 --> 00:20:54,109
<i>I've just been
down there.</i>

332
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,879
You don't suppose we can
just keep that between us?

333
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,847
You think no one
else is going to notice?

334
00:20:58,848 --> 00:21:00,916
No one else is gonna know. I'm on my way

335
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:02,585
down there to tell
them to leave now.

336
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:04,253
Why?

337
00:21:04,254 --> 00:21:07,190
Because there's a gang
of poachers on the loose!

338
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:10,560
- You're kidding.
- Yeah, I am. It's a wolf really.

339
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:24,340
- Evening, Duncan.
- Hi, Ian.

340
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:27,310
Do you not recognize
me with my clothes on?

341
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:31,013
It's a bit chilly to be wandering
about without them, even for me.

342
00:21:31,014 --> 00:21:33,182
<i>But tomorrow's
another day, eh?</i>

343
00:21:33,183 --> 00:21:36,352
Ah, well, that's just-
not for you.

344
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:38,754
I don't suppose you could
translate that for me?

345
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,023
You've got to go.

346
00:21:41,024 --> 00:21:43,292
Oh, I know what this is.

347
00:21:43,293 --> 00:21:44,860
It's victimization.

348
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:47,663
<i>- You think we might lower the tone, do you?
- no!</i>

349
00:21:47,664 --> 00:21:50,132
<i>- No, it's not that.
- yes, it is.</i>

350
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:52,901
We've been thrown off sites
before and I promised myself

351
00:21:52,902 --> 00:21:56,672
- it wouldn't happen again. We're not
going anywhere. - Please, just listen. it's-

352
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:02,411
we think there might
be poachers on the estate.

353
00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:04,280
Oh, I see.

354
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,948
Well, it's your
lucky day then.

355
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,051
<i>Did I not tell you?</i>

356
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:10,653
I'm a policeman.

357
00:22:16,693 --> 00:22:18,728
<i>( wolf howling )</i>

358
00:22:35,946 --> 00:22:39,115
Golly: It won't roam too far,
not to begin with, anyway.

359
00:22:39,116 --> 00:22:41,918
So we start the search, say,
within a mile of the house.

360
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,054
- Yeah, that should do it.
- Then we'll widen out from there.

361
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:46,989
<i>( knocks )</i>

362
00:22:52,796 --> 00:22:54,797
Nice of you
to join us.

363
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:56,565
I didn't sleep
so good.

364
00:22:56,566 --> 00:22:58,201
Ta.

365
00:22:58,202 --> 00:23:00,870
As long as you've got your
wits about you this morning.

366
00:23:00,871 --> 00:23:04,240
We can't open the place but at least
we're the only ones on the estate.

367
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:08,377
Ah, I was going to talk
to you about that.

368
00:23:08,378 --> 00:23:10,679
You did tell the naturalists
they had to leave?

369
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,582
- Oh, aye, absolutely.
- Good.

370
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,853
The only thing is...
they wouldn't listen.

371
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,821
So they're still here?

372
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:25,895
There is something else
perhaps you ought to know.

373
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,197
Yes?

374
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:34,670
What's going on
there?

375
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:38,374
It looks like Duncan's got
his wires crossed again.

376
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,510
Ah, well he might
not be the only one.

377
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:43,712
What do you mean?

378
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,849
Well, you know, I just don't
think you should push it.

379
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,817
You know, with Irene.

380
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:51,787
Do you think I'm gonna
make a fool of myself?

381
00:23:51,788 --> 00:23:55,057
- Oh, no, it's not that.
- What changed your mind?

382
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,226
It's just that we don't
know her very well

383
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,796
and I wouldn't want you getting hurt
on account of something I've said.

384
00:24:00,797 --> 00:24:04,367
Thanks for your concern, Lexie, but I
think I'm old enough to look after myself.

385
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:08,938
( softly )
Great.

386
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,553
<i>- Molly: spotted anything?
- Yes, unfortunately.</i>

387
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:31,127
Kilwillie:
Morning, Archie.

388
00:24:31,128 --> 00:24:33,195
I hope you haven't
had breakfast.

389
00:24:33,196 --> 00:24:36,665
Trout, fresh from
the Kilwillie smokery.

390
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:39,668
No time I'm afraid,
Kilwillie, bit of a crisis on.

391
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:44,040
- I did rather wonder. What's going on?
- We've got a runaway.

392
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:46,943
Irene: Archie! Archie, I've seen it
- the wolf.

393
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,011
Where?

394
00:24:49,012 --> 00:24:51,347
It's just outside
the enclosure.

395
00:24:52,816 --> 00:24:54,683
Molly: Wild animal to recapture.

396
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:57,386
Don't worry, Archie,
Kilwillie will give you a hand.

397
00:24:58,655 --> 00:25:00,289
Of course I'd love to,
but I've got-

398
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,758
rather an important
business appointment.

399
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:06,128
Kilwillie, we need all the help
we can get and I would consider it

400
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,897
a personal favor
if you would volunteer.

401
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:11,500
Oh, well... in that case,

402
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:13,735
I'd be delighted
to offer my services.

403
00:25:13,736 --> 00:25:15,504
Duncan!

404
00:25:16,606 --> 00:25:18,307
Oh no, it's him.

405
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,009
- Who?
- Ian.

406
00:25:22,446 --> 00:25:24,447
But he's dressed.

407
00:25:24,448 --> 00:25:26,815
Yeah, well, you know, they don't always
- do it with...

408
00:25:28,452 --> 00:25:30,552
the man that runs this show,
I want to see him.

409
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,094
That's me.

410
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:41,297
Oh good, 'cause I thought we'd
found quite a little paradise,

411
00:25:41,298 --> 00:25:44,666
but judging by your man Duncan
here's attempt at eviction, it seems

412
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:48,304
you're just as prejudiced as the
rest of the so-called moral majority.

413
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:50,873
Sounds like a public
relations matter to me, Ian,

414
00:25:50,874 --> 00:25:53,342
and that's very much
my department.

415
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,711
Duncan, come on.

416
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,180
- I may call you Ian, mayn't I?
- It is my name.

417
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:01,150
Suits you.
Strong, manly.

418
00:26:01,151 --> 00:26:03,752
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

419
00:26:03,753 --> 00:26:06,522
A Kilwillie's word
is his bond.

420
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,725
I know my mother sometimes
likes to take advantage.

421
00:26:09,726 --> 00:26:12,194
Nonsense.
Glad to be of service.

422
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,664
I often wish I'd been called
Marilyn. So exotic, don't you think?

423
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:17,633
Where are we going?

424
00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:19,535
Tea, scones

425
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,470
and a good old chin-wag.

426
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,944
Tranquilizer guns.

427
00:26:28,945 --> 00:26:33,149
There are still people on the estate,
so speed is what really matters.

428
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,185
Nothing the matter is there?
We've practiced this often enough.

429
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:38,987
- It would be quicker and cleaner to shoot to kill.
- No!

430
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:41,990
And less dangerous. We don't know
how it'll react to being darted.

431
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:43,926
It'll be unconscious
in no time.

432
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:46,929
When an animal's cornered, there's
no telling what might happen.

433
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,631
They do everything they can
to avoid contact with people.

434
00:26:49,632 --> 00:26:52,668
<i>- Oh, I do hope so.
- Golly: that's just textbook stuff.</i>

435
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:56,472
Now it's got a taste of the pheasant,
who knows how many it's gonna take?

436
00:26:56,473 --> 00:26:58,374
Knocking it out solves
the problem as well.

437
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:01,177
It wouldn't have been a problem
if we'd stuck to what we know.

438
00:27:01,178 --> 00:27:03,312
The wolves have been a
mistake from the beginning.

439
00:27:03,313 --> 00:27:06,415
If my memory serves correctly,
the mistake was made

440
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,951
by the person who let one out
in the first place!

441
00:27:08,952 --> 00:27:12,354
Aw, that's not fair. It was my fault,
too. I should have stayed with him.

442
00:27:12,355 --> 00:27:14,390
Maybe, but it doesn't
help much now.

443
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:16,825
<i>- no, but I was-
- have you heard yourselves?</i>

444
00:27:16,826 --> 00:27:18,794
<i>This doesn't solve
anything.</i>

445
00:27:18,795 --> 00:27:20,963
Just go and get
the job done.

446
00:27:22,632 --> 00:27:24,800
She's right.

447
00:27:24,801 --> 00:27:26,868
Well, I'm ready.

448
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:30,539
Are you feeling lucky,
wolf? Well, are you?

449
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,008
Just remember this is a wild
animal we're dealing with.

450
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:35,544
We've all seen what wolves
do to their prey.

451
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:38,214
They always go for the soft,
vulnerable bits, Duncan.

452
00:27:38,215 --> 00:27:40,949
So watch the wind
doesn't blow your kilt up.

453
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:55,664
- More tea?
- No offense,

454
00:27:55,665 --> 00:27:59,401
but when the sun's shining I
don't like to be sitting indoors.

455
00:27:59,402 --> 00:28:02,004
So why don't we go and see if
we can't find that son of yours?

456
00:28:02,005 --> 00:28:04,206
Please, as I said,

457
00:28:04,207 --> 00:28:07,643
any grievances you have,
you can air them with me.

458
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,346
I want to speak to the
organ-grinder, not his-

459
00:28:10,347 --> 00:28:13,382
- monkey?
- Now I was going to say mother.

460
00:28:20,724 --> 00:28:22,525
<i>Duncan:
There's Carlin.</i>

461
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:25,828
Yep. rhis shouldn't
be too difficult at all.

462
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,097
I reckon all it takes is
for one of us to nip down there

463
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:31,333
and let her back in.

464
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,637
- It's safer to be sure.
- That gets my vote.

465
00:28:34,638 --> 00:28:37,105
Wait, wait, wait.
Duncan might be right.

466
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:39,141
<i>( radio playing )</i>

467
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,080
- Brilliant.
- Come on.

468
00:28:49,452 --> 00:28:53,488
( techno music playing )
are you feeling so gay?

469
00:28:53,489 --> 00:28:55,925
( screams )

470
00:28:55,926 --> 00:28:58,360
Hey, hey, no need
to panic.

471
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:01,997
- So what are the guns for?
- We're on the trail of an escaped wolf.

472
00:29:01,998 --> 00:29:04,700
( Heather screams )

473
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,536
Thank you very much, Duncan,
that is just what we needed.

474
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:21,850
This whole wolf hunt thing
is a training exercise.

475
00:29:21,851 --> 00:29:23,953
I just thought we ought
to let you know that.

476
00:29:23,954 --> 00:29:26,989
- Thanks.
- But if you'd feel better away from the place

477
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,491
then we'd be happy to
refund your camping fees.

478
00:29:29,492 --> 00:29:32,294
- I don't think that'll be necessary.
- Why not?

479
00:29:32,295 --> 00:29:34,930
Well, it's not as if
we're in any danger, is it?

480
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:39,735
A bit of a slippery customer,
your boy, isn't he?

481
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,269
Difficult to pin down.

482
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,439
Archie's a very busy man.
He always has something on.

483
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,109
Aye, that's as may be,
but there's no excuse

484
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,678
for poor service, eh? The
customer's always right.

485
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,315
Of course, why don't I
show you round?

486
00:29:53,316 --> 00:29:56,652
Ah, Lexie, this is Ian,
you know from the campsite.

487
00:29:56,653 --> 00:29:59,722
He's looking for Archie. You
haven't seen him, have you?

488
00:29:59,723 --> 00:30:01,389
Uh...

489
00:30:03,226 --> 00:30:05,861
no, no, no,
not for a while.

490
00:30:05,862 --> 00:30:08,897
I mean, he's probably halfway up
that mountain or something by now.

491
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:12,334
Why don't you stay here, you know,
and wait for him until he gets back?

492
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:14,369
What a splendid idea.

493
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:17,673
If you don't mind, Mrs. MacDonald,
I think I'll just go after him.

494
00:30:17,674 --> 00:30:20,909
Then why don't I show you what
Glenbogle has to offer on the way?

495
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,679
- Come on.
- Right.

496
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,615
Now, this is...

497
00:30:43,332 --> 00:30:45,634
( mimicking gunfire )

498
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,138
Duncan!

499
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,609
- Where have you been?
- To fetch this.

500
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,478
You're not gonna
use it, are you?

501
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,080
It will be better
this way.

502
00:30:58,081 --> 00:30:59,982
Come on.

503
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:07,656
I wish I'd brought
my sandwiches.

504
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,792
- Focus, Duncan.
- I'm hungry.

505
00:31:09,793 --> 00:31:13,295
No doubt Irene will have something
hot waiting for us when we get back.

506
00:31:13,296 --> 00:31:16,464
<i>- Now you mention it, I meant
to say- - don't say a word.</i>

507
00:31:17,767 --> 00:31:19,802
- No, sorry, but I've got to-
- shut up.

508
00:31:24,741 --> 00:31:26,742
( gunshot )

509
00:31:31,647 --> 00:31:33,716
You missed.

510
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:35,617
<i>What happened?</i>

511
00:31:35,618 --> 00:31:38,587
The sights must have
taken a knock or something.

512
00:31:38,588 --> 00:31:40,923
I thought I said
tranquilizers only.

513
00:31:40,924 --> 00:31:43,491
Don't worry, Arch,
he missed.

514
00:31:43,492 --> 00:31:46,428
That's the whole point. You're
putting other people in danger.

515
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:52,201
I'm not gonna say this again
- you either do it my way or not at all.

516
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:55,037
Okay.

517
00:31:56,773 --> 00:31:58,640
But if it's my fault she's
on the loose

518
00:31:58,641 --> 00:32:00,275
then it's up
to me to get her back.

519
00:32:00,276 --> 00:32:02,144
Right.

520
00:32:02,145 --> 00:32:04,546
Which way did she go?

521
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:08,550
- Through the trees.
- Duncan, you circle round. I'll take the other side.

522
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,953
Golly, you make a slow
approach with Kilwillie.

523
00:32:10,954 --> 00:32:12,955
Wilco.

524
00:32:12,956 --> 00:32:15,724
- I would be better on my own, Archie.
- No.

525
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,093
You can keep an eye
on each other.

526
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:32,374
Everyone's nervous
the first time.

527
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:36,578
It's a strange attitude we have
to nakedness in this country.

528
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,982
- Molly: But once you've tried
it- - you'll never look back.

529
00:32:39,983 --> 00:32:42,584
Why don't you come down to
the camp and meet the others?

530
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,753
Who knows, you might
even get the urge.

531
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,688
It's a bit close
to home for me.

532
00:32:46,689 --> 00:32:48,991
Not so sure your boy
would approve.

533
00:32:50,293 --> 00:32:52,694
My daughter's the same.

534
00:32:52,695 --> 00:32:55,463
See, where we live,
no one knows.

535
00:32:55,464 --> 00:32:59,067
Heather would be mortified if
we were the talk of the town.

536
00:32:59,068 --> 00:33:02,938
She has enough to put up with
with me being in the police.

537
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,307
So what do your colleagues think?

538
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:07,042
I haven't told
them either.

539
00:33:07,043 --> 00:33:09,278
You can imagine
the jokes, can't you?

540
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,146
"So where do you keep
your truncheon?"

541
00:33:11,147 --> 00:33:13,515
You're very wise.

542
00:33:13,516 --> 00:33:15,517
( growling )

543
00:33:15,518 --> 00:33:17,019
This way, I think.

544
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,821
Wait a minute.

545
00:33:18,822 --> 00:33:21,890
- Have you seen what I've just seen?
- No, no, what is it?

546
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:23,959
Now let's not
play games.

547
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:32,367
This.

548
00:33:32,368 --> 00:33:35,237
Broken glass
and bare feet don't mix.

549
00:33:35,238 --> 00:33:38,073
Safety, safety, safety.

550
00:33:38,074 --> 00:33:40,375
It's the first rule
of the naturist's bible

551
00:33:40,376 --> 00:33:42,744
and I'm a stickler for
what's right and proper.

552
00:33:42,745 --> 00:33:44,713
It doesn't always
make me popular,

553
00:33:44,714 --> 00:33:48,016
but somebody has
to make a stand.

554
00:33:48,017 --> 00:33:50,986
Thank goodness you were there.
I hadn't even noticed it.

555
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,188
You've got to keep
your wits about you.

556
00:33:53,189 --> 00:33:56,624
It's all part of the training.
There's not much gets past me.

557
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,462
We'll have to find a
wee bin to put this in

558
00:34:00,463 --> 00:34:02,464
and put notices up,
Mrs. MacDonald.

559
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:04,566
We don't want glass
left anywhere around.

560
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:06,101
It's very,
very dangerous.

561
00:34:16,446 --> 00:34:18,947
- ( Irene growls )
- Ah!

562
00:34:18,948 --> 00:34:21,249
<i>( Irene laughing )</i>

563
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,251
I suppose you think
that's funny, do you?

564
00:34:23,252 --> 00:34:25,354
You could have given me
a heart attack.

565
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,021
Get away with you.

566
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:29,324
Here, I think these
are yours.

567
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:34,996
No prizes for guessing
what you were up to, then.

568
00:34:34,997 --> 00:34:36,998
Looking for Carlin.

569
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:39,300
Or having a little squint
down at the naturists.

570
00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:41,403
See if you can catch that
girl with her kit off.

571
00:34:41,404 --> 00:34:43,638
- I was not.
- If you say so.

572
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,374
Aye, I do.

573
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,609
I'm surprised you're
not down there with her,

574
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,611
getting a bit
of sunshine.

575
00:34:49,612 --> 00:34:51,179
Or are you one
of those who goes

576
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,015
all red and blotchy
when you expose yourself?

577
00:34:54,016 --> 00:34:56,150
My family tan
very quickly.

578
00:34:56,151 --> 00:34:59,821
- We're known for it.
- Is that right?

579
00:34:59,822 --> 00:35:02,624
And what else are
you good at?

580
00:35:12,935 --> 00:35:15,336
( sniffing )

581
00:35:15,337 --> 00:35:18,673
Look, I'm gonna go on
up the hill.

582
00:35:18,674 --> 00:35:21,943
A sighting is more
likely from the top.

583
00:35:21,944 --> 00:35:23,612
Good idea,
old boy.

584
00:35:23,613 --> 00:35:26,180
Why don't I take
a look over there?

585
00:35:57,847 --> 00:35:59,614
Golly!

586
00:36:04,253 --> 00:36:06,354
Golly!

587
00:36:08,324 --> 00:36:11,059
Golly, I was gonna
tell you.

588
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,261
I tried, but I knew
how hurt you'd be.

589
00:36:13,262 --> 00:36:15,196
I didn't do
it deliberately.

590
00:36:15,197 --> 00:36:17,098
Irene and me
just sort of happened.

591
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:20,569
Please, Golly,
I'm really sorry.

592
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,873
We've still got
a wolf to catch.

593
00:36:32,582 --> 00:36:35,083
Maybe you'd be more
comfortable speaking to my wife.

594
00:36:35,084 --> 00:36:36,952
Oh, I'd really rather
not bother her.

595
00:36:36,953 --> 00:36:39,955
Mrs. MacDonald, I don't think
you're interested in naturism at all.

596
00:36:39,956 --> 00:36:42,223
This is some wild goose
chase you've got me on.

597
00:36:42,224 --> 00:36:45,527
I am not gonna let you
waste any more of my time.

598
00:36:45,528 --> 00:36:47,462
Ian!

599
00:36:49,131 --> 00:36:50,799
- Did you find her?
- No.

600
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,201
Then you'd better be quick
'cause if he gets

601
00:36:53,202 --> 00:36:55,570
so much as a whiff
of what's really going on-

602
00:36:55,571 --> 00:36:57,973
perhaps if we didn't have
kilwille holding us up...

603
00:36:57,974 --> 00:37:01,242
- you really shouldn't encourage him, mother.
- Whyever not?

604
00:37:01,243 --> 00:37:05,213
If you give him reasons to stay, he'll be
here all the time. Not that he isn't anyway.

605
00:37:05,214 --> 00:37:09,050
He's a very dear, old friend and as far
as I'm concerned he has an open invitation.

606
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:11,853
<i>Well, you- you've got
the estate to run,</i>

607
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:14,122
you've got Lexie,
you're a busy man.

608
00:37:14,123 --> 00:37:16,257
Me?

609
00:37:16,258 --> 00:37:18,527
I miss your father.

610
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,129
Now go and make
Glenbogle safe again.

611
00:37:28,103 --> 00:37:29,871
I'll take over
if you like.

612
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,973
Ah, where
have you been?

613
00:37:31,974 --> 00:37:34,042
<i>- Sidetracked.
- Eh?</i>

614
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,945
Have you ever had the feeling
you're missing something?

615
00:37:36,946 --> 00:37:40,314
That it's happening right under
your nose but you just can't see it?

616
00:37:40,315 --> 00:37:42,350
You're imagining
things.

617
00:37:42,351 --> 00:37:44,753
Am I?

618
00:37:49,224 --> 00:37:50,759
Now the important thing-

619
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,028
is not to panic.

620
00:37:54,229 --> 00:37:55,797
<i>So what do we do?</i>

621
00:37:55,798 --> 00:37:58,199
You're the ones that wanted
to get back to nature.

622
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,267
Not this close.

623
00:37:59,268 --> 00:38:02,537
On my signal.
Everybody ready?

624
00:38:04,974 --> 00:38:06,808
- Run!
- ( whining )

625
00:38:31,466 --> 00:38:33,501
Nothing here.

626
00:38:38,808 --> 00:38:40,742
Hang on, Archie.

627
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,950
<i>- ( gunshot )
- ( howling )</i>

628
00:38:50,285 --> 00:38:52,721
Bull's-eye.
I think it's good news.

629
00:38:52,722 --> 00:38:54,388
( groaning )

630
00:39:02,497 --> 00:39:04,365
On the other hand.

631
00:39:15,577 --> 00:39:17,812
So the two of you
just let Golly catch you?

632
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,881
Of course not. We
didn't mean it to happen.

633
00:39:19,882 --> 00:39:22,450
We were just having
a laugh, that's all.

634
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:24,219
And how was he?

635
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,989
- He could do with some practice, but not bad.
- I meant Golly.

636
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,159
Oh, he didn't
look too happy.

637
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,129
- Duncan should have told him.
- Or I could have.

638
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,631
Why didn't you, instead of
driving a wedge through them?

639
00:39:36,632 --> 00:39:38,800
Because for the first time
since I don't know when

640
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:40,935
I just wanted to cut loose
and have some fun.

641
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:43,972
Nothing heavy, nobody getting
hurt and nobody getting upset.

642
00:39:43,973 --> 00:39:45,774
It didn't work out that way, did it?

643
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:48,743
Irene:
No, and I'm sorry.

644
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,247
Oh- never mind.

645
00:39:52,248 --> 00:39:55,449
I think that's the least of
our worries right now. look.

646
00:40:02,091 --> 00:40:05,393
- I'll get some help.
- Yeah, quick as you can, eh?

647
00:40:05,394 --> 00:40:08,329
( growling )

648
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:12,733
Duncan!

649
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:14,669
Over here.

650
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,470
How serious
is this accident?

651
00:40:16,471 --> 00:40:18,873
I guess that's what
we're about to find out.

652
00:40:23,112 --> 00:40:25,746
He's gone,
and it's all my fault.

653
00:40:25,747 --> 00:40:28,382
Molly: Keep calm. That's
not going to help anyone.

654
00:40:29,852 --> 00:40:33,288
Molly? is that you?

655
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:34,622
Yes, Kilwillie,
it's me.

656
00:40:34,623 --> 00:40:37,091
It's all right,
we're going to get help.

657
00:40:37,092 --> 00:40:38,927
It's too late for that.

658
00:40:38,928 --> 00:40:40,995
No, no it's not.

659
00:40:40,996 --> 00:40:43,298
I just wanted
to hang on

660
00:40:43,299 --> 00:40:45,566
until you got here
so that I could

661
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:47,836
tell you
how much I care.

662
00:40:47,837 --> 00:40:51,172
Kilwillie, please. There
are people listening.

663
00:40:51,173 --> 00:40:53,074
Then let them
all be witness

664
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:56,277
to my total devotion.

665
00:40:56,278 --> 00:40:58,379
I knew it.

666
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,216
<i>- He's delirious.
- Kilwillie: Only with happiness,</i>

667
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:05,419
that yours will be the
last face I lay my eyes upon

668
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,289
before I shuffle off
this mortal coil.

669
00:41:09,725 --> 00:41:12,426
Archie, please,
can't we do something?

670
00:41:13,863 --> 00:41:16,331
How long is it since
you fired the shot?

671
00:41:16,332 --> 00:41:18,333
10 minutes.

672
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:22,303
Then I'm afraid not,
mother, no.

673
00:41:30,846 --> 00:41:33,714
( growling )

674
00:41:56,405 --> 00:41:59,774
Look, it's the tunnel
of light.

675
00:42:01,277 --> 00:42:03,912
Does anybody else
hear a harp?

676
00:42:03,913 --> 00:42:07,181
When I pop my clogs, I hope
it'll be quicker than this.

677
00:42:07,182 --> 00:42:10,118
- I've had a good life.
- Oh, please.

678
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:13,321
Archie, try to show
a little compassion.

679
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,890
He's not going to die.
It's just a tranquilizer.

680
00:42:17,192 --> 00:42:20,594
- Oh, Kilwillie!
- I didn't know, did I?

681
00:42:20,595 --> 00:42:23,631
It might make you feel a
little drowsy, that's all.

682
00:42:23,632 --> 00:42:26,034
Well, I've got a pretty
robust constitution.

683
00:42:26,035 --> 00:42:28,803
I dare say, I can
survive a little-

684
00:42:28,804 --> 00:42:31,005
( snoring )

685
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:35,576
What are we
gonna do with him?

686
00:42:35,577 --> 00:42:38,246
Leave him here. It's one
less thing to worry about.

687
00:42:40,482 --> 00:42:42,917
The wolf, it's down
by the house.

688
00:43:27,296 --> 00:43:28,929
( softly )
Lexie, get clear.

689
00:43:36,671 --> 00:43:39,007
( growling )

690
00:43:45,547 --> 00:43:47,081
Nice one.

691
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,418
We still have
to dart her.

692
00:43:53,889 --> 00:43:55,823
Golly?

693
00:43:57,826 --> 00:43:59,927
<i>( wolf growling )</i>

694
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:06,434
<i>( growling continues )</i>

695
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,102
Golly, don't go in there.

696
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,670
Stay back.

697
00:44:33,728 --> 00:44:36,730
<i>( wolf whining )</i>

698
00:44:50,045 --> 00:44:52,780
It's okay.

699
00:44:52,781 --> 00:44:55,416
I'll take her back
to the enclosure.

700
00:45:02,057 --> 00:45:06,260
- Well done, Golly.
- What sort of set up are you clowns running here?

701
00:45:06,261 --> 00:45:08,262
Look, I can
explain everything.

702
00:45:08,263 --> 00:45:11,399
Save it for the authorities. Oh, yes,
I'm gonna have them all down here.

703
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,935
Zoo inspectors, health
and safety, local council.

704
00:45:14,936 --> 00:45:18,005
I'm sure we can
sort this out amicably.

705
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,740
I doubt it.
If I wanted to walk

706
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:22,076
amongst wild animals, I
would have gone on safari.

707
00:45:22,077 --> 00:45:23,611
Think of the publicity.

708
00:45:23,612 --> 00:45:25,980
The more people that know
about this the better.

709
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:27,815
But your name will
be attached to it

710
00:45:27,816 --> 00:45:29,984
and then it'll come out
as to why you were here.

711
00:45:29,985 --> 00:45:33,954
The questions, "where do
you keep your truncheon?"

712
00:45:33,955 --> 00:45:37,425
I know a man of integrity such
as yourself can cope with that-

713
00:45:37,426 --> 00:45:40,128
- of course.
- But think of Heather.

714
00:45:40,129 --> 00:45:42,363
The embarrassment
for her.

715
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:46,200
We both have children who'll
be affected if this comes out.

716
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,302
But what if this
was to happen again?

717
00:45:48,303 --> 00:45:50,871
I think we've learned
our lesson.

718
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,479
Our two heroes,
you were so brave.

719
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,348
Archie: And you're sure
Ian won't say anything?

720
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:03,818
He gave me his word,
and I believe him.

721
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:06,688
Carlin seems happier now
she's back with the pack.

722
00:46:06,689 --> 00:46:10,925
<i>So, all's well
that ends well, eh?</i>

723
00:46:10,926 --> 00:46:12,927
It's not though, is it?

724
00:46:12,928 --> 00:46:15,963
Somebody could have got badly
hurt today because of me.

725
00:46:15,964 --> 00:46:19,400
That fella was right to be angry.
We were lucky to get off so lightly.

726
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:22,804
In future we'll be
taking no more chances.

727
00:46:22,805 --> 00:46:24,739
Are we getting rid
of the wolves?

728
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,608
<i>- no, I'm sending you on a course.
- What sort of a course?</i>

729
00:46:27,609 --> 00:46:31,012
Just to brush up
your basic skills.

730
00:46:31,013 --> 00:46:34,782
Look, if you don't mind me saying so,
even your numeracy is questionable,

731
00:46:34,783 --> 00:46:37,919
<i>judging by those figures
you did for the feed.</i>

732
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,588
- What's numeracy?
- Adding up.

733
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:43,024
Surely you don't
mean that, Archie?

734
00:46:43,025 --> 00:46:45,626
Yes, I do. If I'm going
to run this estate properly

735
00:46:45,627 --> 00:46:48,395
then I need to make sure
that I can rely on everybody.

736
00:46:48,396 --> 00:46:51,398
I would hate to be a drain
on your resources, Archie.

737
00:46:51,399 --> 00:46:53,234
So you just keep
your money.

738
00:46:53,235 --> 00:46:55,302
<i>I don't need a course.</i>

739
00:46:55,303 --> 00:46:59,807
It's not my mind that is
feeble, it's my eyesight.

740
00:46:59,808 --> 00:47:02,810
That's why I didn't lock
the enclosure properly.

741
00:47:02,811 --> 00:47:05,146
That's why I missed
my shot and that...

742
00:47:05,147 --> 00:47:07,581
that's why I can't
do my sums.

743
00:47:07,582 --> 00:47:10,118
So you need glasses.

744
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:13,654
- It's not that simple.
- Of course it is, I wear them myself.

745
00:47:13,655 --> 00:47:16,590
Molly, I've got
this rare condition.

746
00:47:16,591 --> 00:47:18,659
It runs in my family.
My father was

747
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,528
complaining about it just
before he had his heart attack.

748
00:47:21,529 --> 00:47:24,031
<i>By the end you
can barely see at all.</i>

749
00:47:24,032 --> 00:47:26,834
I suppose you could
say he was spared.

750
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:33,841
So, Archie,

751
00:47:33,842 --> 00:47:38,012
you can consider
my resignation tendered.

752
00:47:39,948 --> 00:47:42,183
I'll not be a burden
to you anymore.

753
00:47:46,288 --> 00:47:47,855
Golly!

754
00:47:47,856 --> 00:47:49,957
Archie.

755
00:47:52,227 --> 00:47:54,428
You should stay,
as well.

756
00:47:54,429 --> 00:47:56,363
Well, no one's
stopping me.

757
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,847
Golly.

758
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,449
<i>There's no need
for this.</i>

759
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:17,518
I can't see
any other way.

760
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,054
Glenbogle's your home.

761
00:48:20,055 --> 00:48:23,224
- All your friends are here.
- Friends?

762
00:48:23,225 --> 00:48:24,859
Is that what they are?

763
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,928
Then how can they
treat me like this?

764
00:48:26,929 --> 00:48:28,662
<i>Every one of them-</i>

765
00:48:28,663 --> 00:48:30,932
Archie, Duncan, Irene.

766
00:48:30,933 --> 00:48:33,234
Even you.

767
00:48:33,235 --> 00:48:36,003
Don't say that.

768
00:48:36,004 --> 00:48:38,405
Come on, Lex,
it's the truth.

769
00:48:38,406 --> 00:48:40,607
You knew about
those two all along.

770
00:48:42,244 --> 00:48:45,112
That's what you were
trying to tell me earlier.

771
00:48:45,113 --> 00:48:46,948
You're not
really leaving?

772
00:48:49,918 --> 00:48:51,853
Yeah.

773
00:48:57,592 --> 00:48:59,693
Give this to Archie
for me.

774
00:48:59,694 --> 00:49:01,829
I've no further use
for it.

775
00:49:03,498 --> 00:49:06,167
Golly, please.

776
00:49:06,168 --> 00:49:08,236
<i>Not like this.</i>

777
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:10,404
My mind's made up.

778
00:49:22,117 --> 00:49:24,518
I hope you're happy.

779
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:26,988
I'm sorry.
I really am.

780
00:50:36,524 --> 00:50:39,093
I was just wondering how
many it would be for dinner.

781
00:50:40,728 --> 00:50:43,397
Four.

782
00:50:43,398 --> 00:50:45,532
Lord Kilwillie
won't be eating then?

783
00:50:46,801 --> 00:50:49,103
Both:
Kilwillie!

784
00:50:49,104 --> 00:50:51,038
