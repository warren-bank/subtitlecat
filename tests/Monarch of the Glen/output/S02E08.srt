1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,367
<i>Hector: Now then
- walk towards me, swearing your loyalty</i>

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:07,437
to your lord
and chieftain.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,001
Halt.

4
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:13,238
Now you present to me the ancient
standard of the MacDonalds,

5
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:16,340
carried in battles from
Prestonpans to El Alamein.

6
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:18,409
Then you say
the sacred words

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,211
handed down
from history.

8
00:00:20,212 --> 00:00:22,580
- Hello, dad.
- Give me that!

9
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:26,017
It seems to me, you're not treating
this ceremony with the proper respect.

10
00:00:26,018 --> 00:00:27,786
- Sorry.
- Quite.

11
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:30,421
And I pass the standard
to the lord's attendant,

12
00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:32,257
the lowest member
of my house.

13
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:34,225
Where is Duncan,
by the way?

14
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:44,936
- You must now kiss me.
- I knew there was a catch.

15
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,207
I now proclaim you

16
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,009
chieftain
of this proud land,

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,811
<i>and master
of these men assembled.</i>

18
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:54,712
No need to be formal,
just call me boss.

19
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:57,982
I'm still chief,
for two days more.

20
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:02,320
Then my life's work
is done.

21
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:03,654
Hello, welcome-

22
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:05,890
Joe, the welcome committee
is here.

23
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:10,528
Hello, welcome
to Scotland, my name-

24
00:01:11,663 --> 00:01:13,965
I kiss this ground.

25
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:16,434
The prince
from over the water

26
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:18,169
is home at last.

27
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:20,939
Mr. MacDonald?

28
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,374
( American accent) Chief
MacDonald to you, son.

29
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,810
<i>I'm here to reclaim
my inheritance.</i>

30
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:29,847
I'm the real Laird
of Glenbogle.

31
00:01:29,848 --> 00:01:31,782
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

32
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:09,087
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Glenbogle

33
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:10,889
Retail Experience.

34
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,558
Where the milch cow
of the daytripper will graze.

35
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:17,561
( grumbles )

36
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:18,997
High quality
consumer goods.

37
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:21,299
Granny McCray's
Conserve?

38
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,067
A genuine artifact
celebrating

39
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:25,236
the unique history
and culture of Scotland.

40
00:02:25,237 --> 00:02:26,771
( blows raspberry )

41
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,640
A Nessie
whoopee cushion.

42
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:31,175
"Made in Hong Kong. "

43
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:33,378
To attract the more
discerning shopper.

44
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:36,080
"Amuse your friends with
this rib-tickling Jimmy wig.

45
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:37,681
It's hilarious. "

46
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:40,919
( laughing )

47
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,455
You really think
this will work?

48
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:47,125
Imagine it
- busloads of old codgers let loose in here.

49
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:49,760
Backed up all along
the driveway.

50
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:51,829
If this is the future,
I'm glad I'm in the past.

51
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,464
I think you've done
a marvelous job.

52
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,366
<i>- Thank you, mother.
- and it's perfect</i>

53
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:58,369
that you're opening on the day
of the clan gathering and games.

54
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,072
So, who's going
to do the honors?

55
00:03:01,073 --> 00:03:04,675
That's a good point, I hadn't
thought. What about you, father?

56
00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:07,979
Very well. Kilwillie?

57
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,748
What about Katrina?

58
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:12,850
She got you the grant
for this place.

59
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:14,252
Katrina?

60
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:16,087
She's back?

61
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:20,691
Bonnie, you see
what I'm seeing?!

62
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:23,894
God, if my ma could see this,
she'd never believe it!

63
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:25,763
It's incredible.

64
00:03:25,764 --> 00:03:28,333
Come here, son.

65
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:29,400
See that?

66
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:31,902
<i>It's beautiful, huh?</i>

67
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:35,340
One of these days, that's all
going to be yours. Your destiny.

68
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:38,876
Maybe Angus wants to decide for
himself what to do with his life. Joe!

69
00:03:38,877 --> 00:03:41,512
<i>- where are you going, now?
- I got to walk in the water.</i>

70
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:45,116
I got to feel the good old earth
of Scotland between my toes.

71
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:56,060
The timber's
from the estate-

72
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:59,297
Golly found an old Scots pine
up on the hill.

73
00:03:59,298 --> 00:04:02,467
For centuries it grew
proud on a hill.

74
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:04,702
Giving shelter
to pine martins,

75
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,037
and gold crests,

76
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,239
and what's it
reduced to?

77
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,674
A receptacle
for Jimmy wigs-

78
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:11,775
come on.

79
00:04:11,776 --> 00:04:13,211
- And dust.

80
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,746
I'm sorry if what I've done
upsets you.

81
00:04:17,582 --> 00:04:19,783
I have to get on,
loads to do.

82
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,155
But isn't that
the way of all flesh?

83
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:40,104
Duncan: And in a minute...
Glenbogle, the big house.

84
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:41,805
Golly:
It's probably nothing,

85
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:44,742
but if you're planning on
bringing lorries and coaches over,

86
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,378
- you might want it checked out.
- Looks all right to me.

87
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:49,480
It was built
140 years ago

88
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:51,282
for horse drawn
carriages.

89
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:53,217
And it's the only way
to the house, so...

90
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:54,818
if anything
happened to it...

91
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:57,888
I suppose we'd better get
an engineer to check it out.

92
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:01,192
In the meantime, we'll put up a
sign, keep the heavy stuff off.

93
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:02,260
( bolts rattling )

94
00:05:05,997 --> 00:05:08,066
Our American friends.
I'd better get back.

95
00:05:12,704 --> 00:05:15,106
Archie, something
you should know-

96
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,975
I'll speak to you later.
Hello, welcome to Glenbogle.

97
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:21,112
I second that.
My son Archie.

98
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,680
- Hi, nice to see you.
- Hi.

99
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:25,516
Hi. Thank you for inviting
us into your lovely home.

100
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:27,518
Look at this.

101
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,720
Great Sword of the
MacDonalds, am I right?

102
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:31,489
Huh-
that old thing.

103
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,092
Think it dates
from the 17th century.

104
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:35,526
<i>16th, I think.</i>

105
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:38,496
Forged by a Bavarian
ironmaster

106
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:40,598
called...
Gustavus Mecklin,

107
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:43,033
<i>- if my memory serves.
- Please forgive my husband.</i>

108
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:45,636
I'm afraid he's always
been a bit of a know-it-all.

109
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:49,073
I like to do my research,
dear. Be fully prepared.

110
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:51,109
It's great to have

111
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,811
some American MacDonalds
here for the clan gathering.

112
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,746
Wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

113
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:58,182
And please, this place isn't
a hotel, it's a home.

114
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:01,486
<i>- You must treat it as if it's your own.
- oh, we will.</i>

115
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:06,090
- Won't we, Bonnie?
- Thank you. You're most gracious.

116
00:06:06,091 --> 00:06:08,058
Well...
dinner is at 8:00.

117
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:10,928
Duncan, here, will
show you to your rooms.

118
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:14,832
It's just
a short climb.

119
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,835
Oxygen tanks to be
picked up at base camp,

120
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,203
on the second floor.

121
00:06:25,944 --> 00:06:27,411
Are you going out?

122
00:06:27,412 --> 00:06:29,413
Just popping over
to see Katrina.

123
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:32,550
Right.
Be careful, eh?

124
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:34,519
Okay...

125
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,954
what's that
supposed to mean?

126
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:39,089
I mean...

127
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,091
that the girl
is fragile.

128
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:43,694
She only just
broke up with Fergal.

129
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,563
So, it might not
be best to go

130
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:47,665
stomping over there
in your size 12s,

131
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,934
offering yourself
as a substitute for him.

132
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:53,204
Give her some space
for a while.

133
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,705
<i>Do you get me?</i>

134
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,475
Okay...
thanks.

135
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:02,846
Archie MacDonald.

136
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:13,624
Hi.

137
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,626
Timing impeccable
as usual.

138
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:17,628
Sorry?

139
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:20,130
I didn't realise you
were coming so soon.

140
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:21,599
I would have
cleaned up.

141
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,201
I must look
a right state.

142
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:25,102
No, you look great.

143
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:27,037
Just- great.

144
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,676
Do I...?
Thanks.

145
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:33,678
How are you,
Katrina?

146
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:38,616
Oh, you know.
Okay.

147
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:41,051
That's not true.

148
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:42,486
I feel terrible.

149
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:46,724
All that business
with Fergal was...

150
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,594
it was just a complete disaster.

151
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:52,263
Yeah, right.

152
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,098
Still, the house
looks nice.

153
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:58,736
Sorry?

154
00:07:58,737 --> 00:08:02,005
You using the weathershield
stuff? Golly swears by it.

155
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:04,242
<i>- Archie-
- I suppose in this climate,</i>

156
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:05,843
with all the wind
and the rain,

157
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:08,512
outdoor surfaces need all
the protection they can get.

158
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:12,049
- Why don't you just shut up?
- Eh?

159
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,018
I thought you might
have come here to talk...

160
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:17,187
make human contact.

161
00:08:17,188 --> 00:08:18,922
Right.

162
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:20,424
So?

163
00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:22,460
Well- there
is something.

164
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:26,731
I was wondering...

165
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,369
I was wondering if you'd
like to open the shop.

166
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:34,238
You what?

167
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:37,007
Cut the tape, say a few choice
words. You're good at that,

168
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:38,976
getting on your feet
and sounding off

169
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,646
about something you know
very little about.

170
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,147
Ahem.
That was a joke.

171
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,817
So what do you say?

172
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,320
I say thanks
for dropping by.

173
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,756
It's been
a real comfort.

174
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:53,624
A tonic,
you might say.

175
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,459
Now if you'll
excuse me,

176
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,828
I'm just going to stick
my head in a gas oven.

177
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,032
<i>( door slams )</i>

178
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:04,669
That'll be a "no,"
then.

179
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:10,274
Hector!

180
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:11,475
Hector?

181
00:09:11,476 --> 00:09:13,110
What is it, Monty?

182
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:14,111
( dog whimpers )

183
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:16,447
End of another
day, eh?

184
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:19,650
"And darkness steals across the land. "

185
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:22,252
Oh, there you are.

186
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:25,189
It's nearly dinnertime.

187
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,991
I was thinking
about old digger.

188
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:30,361
The look on that
old dog's face

189
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,797
when the vet
stuck the needle in.

190
00:09:32,798 --> 00:09:35,299
Hector, that was
years ago.

191
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,134
What's the matter?

192
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:38,936
Why have you been
mooning around

193
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:41,439
like old king lear,
these last few days?

194
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,940
It's hard
to explain.

195
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:44,942
( scoffs )
Is it now?

196
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:46,844
Well, let me try then.

197
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:49,714
All Archie's hard work
is coming to fruition.

198
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,916
Conversely, your grip
on what you regard

199
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:55,519
as your life's work,
is weakening.

200
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:59,557
<i>You're a monarch.
About to be dethroned.</i>

201
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,426
<i>Consequently, you feel</i>

202
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:05,128
<i>old and useless,
and redundant.</i>

203
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:06,530
"What,"
you ask yourself,

204
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:08,532
"is the point of
carrying on?" Am I right?

205
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:11,569
That about sums
it up, yes.

206
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,137
I know you're right,
but what am I to do?

207
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:17,742
Look at it this way. You
live in a beautiful place.

208
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,043
You have two
lovely children.

209
00:10:20,044 --> 00:10:22,713
One grandchild,
you have good health,

210
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:25,716
and last
but no means least,

211
00:10:25,717 --> 00:10:28,686
a beautiful
and loving wife.

212
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:31,455
So...?

213
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:34,692
Snap out of it, Hector, for
goodness sakes! There's a dear.

214
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:37,728
Come on.

215
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:39,597
( dog whimpering )

216
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,801
<i>( car door slams )</i>

217
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:46,970
Impossible woman!
Ridiculous...

218
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:49,339
- how did it go?
- How did it go?

219
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,943
Famously, swimmingly,
expi-ali-dociously!

220
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,245
Archie-
this is important.

221
00:10:55,246 --> 00:10:57,114
- Are you and Katrina-?
- Finished.

222
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,949
Not that we
ever got started.

223
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,185
Am I physically grotesque,
Lexie? Am I gross or insensitive?

224
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:03,987
Boorish, or dull or-

225
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:06,857
no, you're not, Arch.
Far from it.

226
00:11:06,858 --> 00:11:09,359
I think you and I need
to have a conversation

227
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,261
about a matter
of a mutual interest.

228
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:12,596
Later, after dinner.

229
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:16,600
I'll be waiting,
sunshine.

230
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:18,969
<i>Joe: You know, when I was a kid</i>

231
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,605
my old ma use to sit me on her knees

232
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:24,274
<i>and tell me stories
about how her family</i>

233
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:26,644
were descended from these
big people in Scotland.

234
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,413
- Hector?
- Sorry- fascinating.

235
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:31,582
I bet a lot of Americans
have stories like that.

236
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,484
<i>It wasn't till recently
that I discovered</i>

237
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,052
<i>just how big
these people were,</i>

238
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:36,687
<i>or how close
the connection was.</i>

239
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:39,323
Joe, what are we
going to do tomorrow?

240
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,592
We have to find something
that Angus will enjoy.

241
00:11:41,593 --> 00:11:43,794
<i>I got this Mormon genealogist
to check it out,</i>

242
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:46,129
and got my lawyers
on the case.

243
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,899
The results were
really very interesting.

244
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,234
<i>- And what were they?
- well, Archie-</i>

245
00:11:51,235 --> 00:11:53,838
- can I call you Archie?
- Sure.

246
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,305
Bottom line is...

247
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:57,875
the rightful Laird
of Glenbogle,

248
00:11:57,876 --> 00:12:01,144
<i>the real commander-in-chief
of the MacDonalds,</i>

249
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:03,080
is me.

250
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:04,582
( chuckles )

251
00:12:06,084 --> 00:12:07,985
<i>Isn't that
the darndest thing?</i>

252
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:10,988
Molly: Sure is... the darndest thing.

253
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:14,358
<i>- Well, well.
- Archie: this is ridiculous.</i>

254
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,760
Have you got any proof?
Any evidence to back it up?

255
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:18,328
Kind of.

256
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:21,198
<i>If you don't
believe me,</i>

257
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,667
take a look at this.

258
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:30,440
<i>Archie:
This is unbelievable.</i>

259
00:12:30,441 --> 00:12:33,043
<i>Joe: Hmm, I know what you mean.</i>

260
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,946
It was kind of tough
for me too at first, but...

261
00:12:35,947 --> 00:12:38,716
now I'm getting used
to the idea.

262
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,184
<i>You have the nerve to
sit at our dining table,</i>

263
00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:45,255
and calmly announce that you're
going to take this family's home away?

264
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:48,859
Archie, please, there are certain
obligations of hospitality.

265
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,829
Bonnie, Joe, you're most
welcome, as long as you don't do

266
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,498
what our ancestors may
have done- run Archie through

267
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:56,366
<i>with a sword
in the middle of the night.</i>

268
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:58,802
( group laughing )

269
00:12:58,803 --> 00:13:01,005
Oh, Angus...

270
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:05,175
your mommy sent me up
with your milk and cookies,

271
00:13:05,176 --> 00:13:07,411
so why don't you

272
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,179
( sweetly )
Come and get it?

273
00:13:14,185 --> 00:13:16,119
<i>- good night, Joe.
- Night, Hector.</i>

274
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,188
- Night, Bonnie.
- Night, Hector.

275
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:24,929
Why are you being
so nice to them?

276
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,496
Put them
off their guard.

277
00:13:26,497 --> 00:13:28,432
Don't let them see
we're worried.

278
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,467
What are we gonna do?
This is serious.

279
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:32,803
Think hard and act
expeditiously.

280
00:13:32,804 --> 00:13:34,304
That'll make
a change.

281
00:13:34,305 --> 00:13:37,441
Why don't you just
leave it to Archie?

282
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,909
Night, boys.

283
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,644
Good night.
I need whiskey.

284
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:42,279
This is
a three-dram problem.

285
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,915
We need somebody who knows
about this sort of thing,

286
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,984
with a cool head
and a sharp brain.

287
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:50,420
- And low animal cunning.
- Exactly.

288
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:52,856
I know just the man.

289
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:04,635
<i>Bonnie: Never been so
embarrassed in my whole life!</i>

290
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,336
Don't know why
it's such a big deal.

291
00:14:06,337 --> 00:14:08,138
We had a deal,
which you broke.

292
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,208
<i>We'd come and see if it suited
all of us before you started-</i>

293
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:14,578
we did, and it does.
It's perfect.

294
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,480
Just what we need
right now.

295
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,615
Joe, I-

296
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:19,516
Joe, I'm talking
to you.

297
00:14:19,517 --> 00:14:20,651
Where are you
going?

298
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,886
To say good night
to the son and heir.

299
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,057
Ah, Lexie,
just the girl.

300
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:28,425
That's me.

301
00:14:28,426 --> 00:14:31,061
We need lots of coffee.
We'll be staying up all night.

302
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:33,230
Sounds promising.

303
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:34,932
Well, I'm ready.

304
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,299
Ready for what?

305
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,802
Our chat. We arranged to have a chat-

306
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:41,404
I have no time for that. I
have to speak to Kilwillie.

307
00:14:41,405 --> 00:14:42,572
Kilwillie?!

308
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:44,274
Yea, lo and verily,

309
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:47,377
the savior did leave Galilee
and come unto Glenbogle.

310
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:49,780
Kilwillie,
am I glad to see you.

311
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:52,349
Well, as soon as we're
all sitting comfortably,

312
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,651
we'll begin.

313
00:14:53,652 --> 00:14:56,419
<i>Joe:
The tale of Ranald MacDonald,</i>

314
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,222
chief of the Clan MacDonald
of Glenbogle,

315
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:01,925
who fought bravely
by Bonnie Prince Charlie's side

316
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:04,294
right to the very end
of the 45.

317
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:06,063
Noble defeat
at Culloden.

318
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:08,465
He slipped away after the
battle and hid in a cave,

319
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:10,701
<i>here, while the redcoats
ransacked the house.</i>

320
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,836
Later took a boat for
the colonies in Virginia,
321
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:14,571
cut down forests,
and grew tobacco.

322
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:16,807
And promptly picked
another fight with the English.

323
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:18,508
He led a regiment
of militia

324
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:20,110
in the War of Independence.

325
00:15:20,111 --> 00:15:21,845
He was so smart

326
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:23,714
and so brave

327
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,483
that they called him
"the Hammer of the English. "

328
00:15:26,484 --> 00:15:28,251
<i>- Then what?
- Hector: well, nothing.</i>

329
00:15:28,252 --> 00:15:30,253
That side of the family
just got lost.

330
00:15:30,254 --> 00:15:33,256
Until now.
It's all in here.

331
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:34,825
You descend

332
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:37,661
from Ranald's
younger brother Donald.

333
00:15:37,662 --> 00:15:40,530
<i>He snatched his elder brother's
lands and titles,</i>

334
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:43,333
apparently illegally.

335
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:46,336
Well, this Joe person
is a direct descendant...

336
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:48,772
...of Ranald himself.

337
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:49,907
Your great-great-

338
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:53,210
great-great-great-
great-great-grandfather.

339
00:15:56,014 --> 00:15:57,881
What do you think
of that?

340
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:01,318
<i>One day, Angus...</i>

341
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:04,321
you'll know just what a great
thing in your life this is.

342
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:17,267
Now, does everyone understand
the general strategy?

343
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,269
Yes, find out as much
as we can about them,

344
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,004
look for weaknesses
in their case.

345
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:22,606
Which I have
to report, amigos,

346
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,141
looks as robust
as the dollar.

347
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:26,043
At the same time,
put them off the place.

348
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:27,444
Shouldn't be
too difficult.

349
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,880
Emphasise the irritating
problems of living here.

350
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:32,349
Maybe spend an afternoon
with you, Hector.

351
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,919
Or even better, Archie.

352
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,654
How about...

353
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:39,823
getting the bog
in their bathroom

354
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,992
to back up
from the septic tank?

355
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:46,596
Meanwhile, I shall seek
the opinion

356
00:16:46,597 --> 00:16:48,331
of Kilwillie's ace lawyer.

357
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:51,235
Hector, forgive me, but isn't
this all rather two-faced?

358
00:16:51,236 --> 00:16:52,803
What's the matter
with that?

359
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,704
We're fighting
for our lives here!

360
00:16:54,705 --> 00:16:57,307
Time, as they would say,
to play hard bowl.

361
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,942
Ball, Hector.

362
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:00,377
They call it hardball.

363
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:02,112
Oh, yeah!
Hardball, sorry.

364
00:17:02,113 --> 00:17:04,681
Right, this session of the
war cabinet is now over.

365
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:06,616
You know your tasks,
go to them.

366
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:28,772
<i>( vehicle approaching )</i>

367
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,346
Have you run out
of paint?

368
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,949
My notice to quit
the cottage.

369
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,351
<i>One month, I think.</i>

370
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:53,730
If you're going
to move in here,

371
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:55,765
you need to know
what you're taking on.

372
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:58,001
Very good of you,
Hector.

373
00:17:58,002 --> 00:18:01,171
- Morning.
- ( surly ) is it?

374
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:02,472
Who was that?

375
00:18:02,473 --> 00:18:04,107
Our head man
MacKenzie.

376
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:05,642
What's he like?

377
00:18:05,643 --> 00:18:07,610
All right, when
he's not on strike.

378
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:10,447
- ( crashes )
- Or drunk.

379
00:18:10,448 --> 00:18:12,615
Best avoided then,
fearful temper.

380
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:14,617
When he's sober?

381
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:16,586
When he's sober?
Well...

382
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:18,889
he's never
completely sober.

383
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,290
Sad, really.

384
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:25,329
If you're going to be
spending more time here,

385
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,030
I should show you
the local shops.

386
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:30,167
- Great. Is there a mall?
- Oh, the shop's here.

387
00:18:30,168 --> 00:18:31,434
Just the one?

388
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:34,471
The garage and the funeral
director are down there.

389
00:18:34,472 --> 00:18:36,740
That's it? You get
everything you need here?

390
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,575
There's a sweet
little supermarket

391
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,510
an hour's drive
that way.

392
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,113
Clothes? Makeup?
Accessories?

393
00:18:43,114 --> 00:18:45,849
Harrods.
12 hours that way.

394
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:49,253
Sure is in
a parlous state, Hector.

395
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,256
Oh, these outbuildings are
nothing compared to the house.

396
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,124
Dry rot, wet rot,
the roof...

397
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,394
- you don't say? - We've had estimates
for the work, of course,

398
00:18:57,395 --> 00:19:00,163
but
- ha! Never seen so many naughts in my life.

399
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:02,732
- How much?
- Oh, ridiculous sum.

400
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:04,034
Three million.

401
00:19:04,035 --> 00:19:06,503
- Sterling or dollars?
- Sterling, of course.

402
00:19:06,504 --> 00:19:08,605
That's okay.
Within budget.

403
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,274
When we sold
the company,

404
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,109
we were left
pretty comfortable.

405
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,510
Really?

406
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:16,679
Cashed in to the tune
of 110 million-

407
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,415
dollars.

408
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,820
( coughing )

409
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:27,357
Duncan, have you got some kind
of dead animal in this vehicle?

410
00:19:27,358 --> 00:19:29,426
Just my old coat, Molly.

411
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:32,095
Sorry if it's a bit ripe.

412
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:35,165
I'm really sorry, Molly,
but I think I'm gonna upchuck.

413
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,633
( Bonnie choking )

414
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,435
( sniffing )

415
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:51,982
Oh!

416
00:19:58,056 --> 00:20:00,623
Beautiful.
Just beautiful.

417
00:20:00,624 --> 00:20:02,892
Well, we've tried to
look after it for you.

418
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:04,361
You're lucky,

419
00:20:04,362 --> 00:20:06,196
having your son
beside you here.

420
00:20:06,197 --> 00:20:08,765
He's a good boy. No life
for him here, you know.

421
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:10,434
Terrible hole.

422
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:12,169
Your crest, huh?

423
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,338
Guess I'll be needing
one of those.

424
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,273
Oh, yeah? What symbol will you have,

425
00:20:16,274 --> 00:20:17,807
a pair of crossed
hamburgers?

426
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:19,409
You're a funny guy,
Hector.

427
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,445
But if you think
you're gonna put me off

428
00:20:21,446 --> 00:20:23,413
this wonderful place,
you're wrong.

429
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:25,048
This is my life now.

430
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:31,288
All right,
judgment day has come!

431
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,992
You come smarming over here
with your helicopters

432
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:37,060
and your
thousand dollar trainers!

433
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:39,662
You think you're so much
better than us, don't you?

434
00:20:39,663 --> 00:20:41,865
<i>You give no respect.</i>

435
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,633
Well, let me tell you,

436
00:20:43,634 --> 00:20:46,603
you spoiled little brat,

437
00:20:46,604 --> 00:20:48,838
<i>you are nothing!</i>

438
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:51,041
You're less
than nothing!

439
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:54,944
You are minus nothing
to the power 10!

440
00:20:54,945 --> 00:20:56,346
<i>Do you get me?!</i>

441
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,485
<i>( Angus sniffling )</i>

442
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:08,725
Angus-

443
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:12,029
that's my dad's
stupid name for me!

444
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,431
All my friends
call me Ricky.

445
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:18,735
Listen...
I didn't mean-

446
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,870
me and my brother,

447
00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:22,539
Joe Junior-

448
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,741
we used to play tricks
on each other.

449
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,544
Joe Jr.?

450
00:21:33,817 --> 00:21:35,985
Is that "Pictish invader"?

451
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:39,089
<i>( game beeping )</i>

452
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,792
What level
are you at?

453
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,238
You're a bit early
for fond farewells.

454
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:57,607
I'm not leaving
for another four weeks.

455
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,176
Before you go...

456
00:21:59,177 --> 00:22:01,411
there's a few things
I'd like to say to you.

457
00:22:01,412 --> 00:22:03,813
Are you sure they're
worth listening to?

458
00:22:03,814 --> 00:22:05,682
I think so.

459
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:09,086
Why don't you come around
for a drink tonight?

460
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:11,154
I would really like
to see you.

461
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:14,691
Yeah, all right.

462
00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:23,333
Ah. Well?

463
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:26,436
Well, according
to your lawyers,

464
00:22:26,437 --> 00:22:28,838
he has
a very strong case.

465
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,740
I feared as much.

466
00:22:30,741 --> 00:22:33,210
Exhaustively researched...

467
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:36,446
and backed up by a heap
of legal opinion.

468
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:38,348
Can't we challenge it
in court?

469
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:40,217
<i>Kilwillie's man
said it was futile.</i>

470
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:42,885
We'd probably lose, and spend
a fortune in the process,

471
00:22:42,886 --> 00:22:44,454
which of course
we don't have.

472
00:22:45,523 --> 00:22:47,524
Of course...

473
00:22:47,525 --> 00:22:50,827
you could always try the
chieftain's challenge.

474
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,863
Kilwillie...

475
00:22:53,864 --> 00:22:56,399
you lovely,
clever man!

476
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,268
Terribly risky,
though.

477
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:01,771
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

478
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:05,408
And what on earth is
"The Chieftain's Challenge"?

479
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:07,511
It was a way of solving
leadership disputes

480
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:09,246
in the good old
bad old days.

481
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:12,382
Rivals were tested to see who
was the best man for the job.

482
00:23:12,383 --> 00:23:15,718
Made rather more sense than
plunging the clan into civil war.

483
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:18,755
But this is the 21st century, right?

484
00:23:18,756 --> 00:23:20,423
I have a terrific case in law.

485
00:23:20,424 --> 00:23:23,160
Oh, you don't know
Scottish law, Joe.

486
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:24,994
We would fight you
to the death.

487
00:23:24,995 --> 00:23:27,497
<i>It'd be a war of attrition, I'm afraid.</i>

488
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:29,732
- Might last five years, 10...
- easily.

489
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:31,834
At the end of the day,
the only winners

490
00:23:31,835 --> 00:23:33,470
would be the lawyers.

491
00:23:33,471 --> 00:23:36,506
Kilwillie: It always distresses
me when I see good men

492
00:23:36,507 --> 00:23:39,309
contemplate lining the
pockets of the shyster brigade.

493
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,144
Indeed, but that's
beside the point.

494
00:23:41,145 --> 00:23:43,246
The clan used the procedure
centuries ago

495
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:45,448
to find the best leader,
the man most worthy.

496
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:47,584
I thought you'd like
that kind of challenge.

497
00:23:47,585 --> 00:23:50,220
<i>Kilwillie: If you wish to
be considered a gentleman.</i>

498
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,489
I'm not a gentleman.
I'm an American.

499
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:57,026
- But a challenge, right?
- A test of brain,

500
00:23:57,027 --> 00:23:59,162
a test of brawn,
and...

501
00:23:59,163 --> 00:24:01,231
a test of wisdom.

502
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:05,101
Okay.

503
00:24:06,304 --> 00:24:07,804
I'll do it.

504
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,808
This is so sweet.

505
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:13,710
My little refuge.

506
00:24:13,711 --> 00:24:16,246
I can see how
you might need it.

507
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:19,549
You don't really want to be a
laird's wife, do you, Bonnie?

508
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,017
It's my husband's dream.

509
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:23,886
Guess I haven't got it in
my heart to deny it to him.

510
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:30,227
What's this?

511
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,730
Ooh, it's... Jamie.

512
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:35,865
He died here
some years ago.

513
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:37,234
<i>In the loch.</i>

514
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:39,869
He was our boy,
our eldest son.

515
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,871
<i>( Bonnie gasps )</i>

516
00:24:41,872 --> 00:24:43,806
What is it?

517
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:47,176
We lost a son.
Last year.

518
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:49,946
Our eldest,

519
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,581
Joe Jr.

520
00:24:51,582 --> 00:24:52,915
Oh...

521
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:55,318
he kinda lost himself.

522
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,656
He and his father
hadn't spoken in... years.

523
00:24:59,657 --> 00:25:01,258
He died of an overdose.

524
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:03,360
Oh, my dear girl.

525
00:25:03,361 --> 00:25:05,428
Joe blames himself.
I mean...

526
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:07,264
that's why
he sold the business.

527
00:25:07,265 --> 00:25:09,699
That's what this is all
about, this obsession,

528
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,201
getting away, making a
fresh start somewhere.

529
00:25:12,202 --> 00:25:14,471
Oh, I understand,
I do, I do.

530
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,606
I've longed for that
for myself, but...

531
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:18,441
then Archie went away
for years.

532
00:25:18,442 --> 00:25:20,176
It wasn't easy
for him.

533
00:25:20,177 --> 00:25:22,044
It's not for Angus-

534
00:25:22,045 --> 00:25:23,946
Ricky.

535
00:25:23,947 --> 00:25:26,349
He loved his brother
so much.

536
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:29,852
You stayed.

537
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:38,662
You can't leave here,
can you, Molly?

538
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,463
Your boy's here.

539
00:25:41,532 --> 00:25:43,933
At peace.

540
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:45,468
( Molly sobs )

541
00:25:48,272 --> 00:25:50,039
<i>( clock striking )</i>

542
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,178
Psst!

543
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,021
So...?

544
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,556
Tonight's
the night, then?

545
00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:07,657
I'm sorry?

546
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:09,192
For our wee
t�te-�-t�te?

547
00:26:10,494 --> 00:26:12,696
I can't, I've got
this revision to do.

548
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:15,164
If you don't know it now,
you never will, Archie.

549
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:17,867
This can't wait any longer.
It's really important.

550
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,669
Archie, come on.

551
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,205
I'll test you on the clan
wars of the 15th century.

552
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:25,074
Sorry, Lex. Next week's dinner
menu will just have to wait.

553
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:27,811
It's not dinner men-
Arch!

554
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:38,588
Looks good, huh?

555
00:26:38,589 --> 00:26:40,089
Unbelievable.

556
00:26:42,593 --> 00:26:44,461
<i>- Joe?
- Uh-huh?</i>

557
00:26:44,462 --> 00:26:47,930
<i>When are you gonna face up
to reality? Never mind a kilt,</i>

558
00:26:47,931 --> 00:26:51,868
what you've been wearing for the last
year is a pair of oversized blinkers.

559
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:54,838
- Ever since Joey died.
- I don't want to talk about that.

560
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:57,306
Of course not.
That's my point.

561
00:26:57,307 --> 00:27:00,176
You want to escape to
some fantasy land somewhere

562
00:27:00,177 --> 00:27:03,346
where everything is safe
and cozy and free from pain.

563
00:27:03,347 --> 00:27:05,849
What are you
talking about?

564
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,184
How do you think
these good people feel

565
00:27:08,185 --> 00:27:10,253
about being put out
of their home?

566
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,789
Where their children
were born and grew up and-

567
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,591
oh yeah, where one
of them died.

568
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:15,892
You don't understand.

569
00:27:15,893 --> 00:27:19,328
This place is our future.
It's our destiny.

570
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:21,664
No, it isn't.
It's your weird obsession.

571
00:27:21,665 --> 00:27:24,100
It has nothing to do
with us or our son.

572
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,568
You're wrong!

573
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:27,336
It's him I'm doing it for,
all of it!

574
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:30,507
Joe, he doesn't want it!
It means nothing to him!

575
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:33,009
He's miserable here!

576
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,712
- Oh!
- Yes!

577
00:27:35,713 --> 00:27:37,714
You dancer!
Well done, mate.

578
00:27:37,715 --> 00:27:39,181
You want a fruit gum?

579
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,061
Well,

580
00:27:52,062 --> 00:27:53,563
what can we do
for you?

581
00:27:53,564 --> 00:27:55,998
Lexie, I've come
to see Archie.

582
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:58,267
You'll be lucky.

583
00:27:58,268 --> 00:27:59,769
He asked me over.

584
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,707
Archie?
Asked you?

585
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,142
For a chat.

586
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,814
Don't you think
he's suffered enough?

587
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,014
Sorry?

588
00:28:12,015 --> 00:28:13,716
<i>Have you no idea
what he went through</i>

589
00:28:13,717 --> 00:28:16,285
<i>when you were dabbling with
your dreamboat from Dublin?</i>

590
00:28:16,286 --> 00:28:19,021
<i>But now you've dumped him,
and you snap your fingers</i>

591
00:28:19,022 --> 00:28:21,157
and expect Archie
to come running.

592
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:24,761
That sounds like a pretty good
definition of mental cruelty to me.

593
00:28:24,762 --> 00:28:25,762
That is not fair.

594
00:28:25,763 --> 00:28:27,797
Och!
Give me a break, darling!

595
00:28:29,934 --> 00:28:32,702
Hasn't it occurred to you,
maybe our mutual friend

596
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:34,604
looked for a more
reliable partner

597
00:28:34,605 --> 00:28:37,507
while you were leading him
such a not-very-merry dance?

598
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:39,241
What?

599
00:28:39,242 --> 00:28:41,344
Do you mean...
Archie and you...

600
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,647
I'm fond
of a slow smooch, myself.

601
00:28:44,648 --> 00:28:47,116
Maybe that's what he wanted
to talk to you about, eh?

602
00:28:48,452 --> 00:28:50,019
Right.

603
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,254
Well, I better go.

604
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:53,656
Good night, Lexie.

605
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:01,097
( humming )

606
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:05,001
<i>( humming continues )</i>

607
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,175
- Arch, that you?
- Yep?

608
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,919
Lexie, what are you doing? I'm-

609
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,489
busy, I know. I've got
something important to tell you,

610
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,424
<i>and it can't keep
any longer.</i>

611
00:29:29,627 --> 00:29:31,160
Now...

612
00:29:31,161 --> 00:29:34,030
you know I fancied you
from the minute I saw you.

613
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:37,299
<i>And since I've got to
know you as a person,</i>

614
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,301
a man...

615
00:29:39,302 --> 00:29:40,637
my feelings have grown.

616
00:29:41,872 --> 00:29:43,039
Have they?

617
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:47,176
You're... caring,

618
00:29:47,177 --> 00:29:48,678
you're kind...

619
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:50,914
<i>you think
about other people...</i>

620
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:53,115
at the same time,
you're strong.

621
00:29:54,552 --> 00:29:56,485
You're special, Arch.

622
00:29:59,322 --> 00:30:01,057
I want to be with you.

623
00:30:02,526 --> 00:30:04,027
Understand me?

624
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:09,498
What do you say?

625
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:13,036
Um...

626
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,172
it's difficult.

627
00:30:18,408 --> 00:30:20,577
I don't know
what to say.

628
00:30:20,578 --> 00:30:22,745
Well,
work it out-

629
00:30:22,746 --> 00:30:24,280
<i>quick.</i>

630
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,749
Lexie, you're...

631
00:30:28,218 --> 00:30:30,252
you're funny,
you're...

632
00:30:30,253 --> 00:30:33,189
<i>clever, you're
beautiful, you're... wise,</i>

633
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,592
<i>you're very,
very sweet.</i>

634
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:37,894
But?

635
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,031
Katrina got to me first.

636
00:30:46,604 --> 00:30:47,704
I see.

637
00:30:48,906 --> 00:30:50,573
I'm sorry, Lexie.

638
00:30:50,574 --> 00:30:51,741
<i>I really am.</i>

639
00:30:53,877 --> 00:30:56,679
It's all right.

640
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,348
I'd already
guessed it anyway.

641
00:30:59,349 --> 00:31:01,217
Archie-
oh, morning, Lexie-

642
00:31:01,218 --> 00:31:03,052
<i>your father's
anxious to leave.</i>

643
00:31:03,053 --> 00:31:04,787
Come on, my boy!
I've got the keys

644
00:31:04,788 --> 00:31:06,689
I've got the sword.
I need my champion!

645
00:31:07,758 --> 00:31:10,259
( bagpipes playing )

646
00:31:21,238 --> 00:31:24,240
( bandleader
shouting orders )

647
00:31:27,645 --> 00:31:29,712
( bagpipes, drums playing )

648
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,897
<i>( music ends, applause )</i>

649
00:32:58,902 --> 00:33:01,704
With the power
vested in me

650
00:33:01,705 --> 00:33:03,639
as chief of the Clan MacDonald,

651
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,744
I declare
this 147th Gathering and Games

652
00:33:07,745 --> 00:33:09,545
in session.

653
00:33:09,546 --> 00:33:11,848
For those in combat today,

654
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:15,118
<i>may your eye be keen...</i>

655
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,787
<i>and your arm be strong.</i>

656
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:21,724
The Clan MacDonald!

657
00:33:21,725 --> 00:33:24,260
All:
Clan MacDonald!

658
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:26,028
( applause, cheering )

659
00:33:33,036 --> 00:33:35,772
You come
to watch me win?

660
00:33:35,773 --> 00:33:37,539
Make a fool of yourself, you mean?

661
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,142
How could I
stay away?

662
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:44,180
Well...

663
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:46,682
time to begin.
Best of luck.

664
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:48,217
- Thank you.
- Good luck, my boy.

665
00:33:48,218 --> 00:33:50,219
Your ancestors will be
with you in spirit.

666
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,854
Very comforting.

667
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:53,189
Break a leg,
darling.

668
00:33:54,391 --> 00:33:55,624
But not really.

669
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,577
The first part
of the challenge...

670
00:34:15,578 --> 00:34:19,115
tests the rivals' skill
at one of the clan's

671
00:34:19,116 --> 00:34:23,119
most important
and most venerated rituals:

672
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,088
Stealing his neighbor's livestock!

673
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:27,256
( laughter )

674
00:34:27,257 --> 00:34:29,325
To your stations!

675
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,730
One...

676
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:35,865
<i>two...</i>

677
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,666
three... go!

678
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:04,894
Joe MacDonald
wins easily.

679
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:07,563
Archie MacDonald
better buck his ideas up!

680
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,731
( bleats )

681
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,499
( applause, cheering )

682
00:35:12,002 --> 00:35:13,970
( playing )

683
00:35:24,014 --> 00:35:26,648
<i>Kilwillie: The second
part of the challenge...</i>

684
00:35:26,649 --> 00:35:28,817
<i>- swap.
- tests the rivals' knowledge</i>

685
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:31,420
<i>of the clan
they wish to lead.</i>

686
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:34,123
I have selected
10 questions,

687
00:35:34,124 --> 00:35:35,424
five for each candidate,

688
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,894
<i>about the history
of the MacDonalds.</i>

689
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:47,303
Katrina!

690
00:35:47,304 --> 00:35:49,105
I need
to talk to you.

691
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:51,340
I don't want to talk
to you. I'm going home.

692
00:35:51,341 --> 00:35:54,810
Look, I spoke out of turn last night.

693
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:56,312
I want to make it right.

694
00:35:56,313 --> 00:35:58,314
( applause )

695
00:35:58,315 --> 00:36:00,749
Each candidate has dropped
only one point.

696
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,185
<i>So we have a tie
at 4-all.</i>

697
00:36:03,186 --> 00:36:05,521
I'm going to ask
a tie-break question.

698
00:36:05,522 --> 00:36:08,124
<i>How did Angus MacDonald...</i>

699
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,658
<i>choose Glenbogle</i>

700
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:12,028
<i>to be the site
of his castle?</i>

701
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:17,967
<i>Archie: I know this, something
to do with a hawthorn tree.</i>

702
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:33,282
He strapped a chest of gold
to the back of a donkey,

703
00:36:33,283 --> 00:36:36,452
<i>let it wander over his
lands. It headed for the loch,</i>

704
00:36:36,453 --> 00:36:38,754
stopped by a hawthorn tree
and urinated.

705
00:36:38,755 --> 00:36:41,958
And that's where
he built his castle.

706
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:44,126
<i>- are you sure about that?
- Yes!</i>

707
00:36:44,127 --> 00:36:47,163
- You don't want to change your mind?
- No.

708
00:36:48,231 --> 00:36:50,799
- Correct!
- Yes!

709
00:36:53,603 --> 00:36:55,637
<i>Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

710
00:36:55,638 --> 00:37:00,509
<i>the final part of the Chieftain's
Challenge takes place in five minutes.</i>

711
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,484
Lexie, I've not got time
for this.

712
00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:09,952
Well make time.
Sit down.

713
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:14,991
Now... I want
to talk to you.

714
00:37:14,992 --> 00:37:16,658
<i>About Katrina.</i>

715
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:18,627
Why aren't the pair
of you together?

716
00:37:18,628 --> 00:37:21,697
( sighs )
I don't know...

717
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,733
<i>maybe because there's always
been something in the way.</i>

718
00:37:24,734 --> 00:37:30,639
<i>First, it was Justine, then
there was Fergal. Now he's gone.</i>

719
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,542
<i>I don't know, we just can't
seem to reach each other.</i>

720
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,212
<i>Lexie: Never mind that.
That's all in the past.</i>

721
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:39,982
<i>The only important thing is how
you feel about each other now.</i>

722
00:37:39,983 --> 00:37:42,985
<i>Archie: I feel the same
way I've always felt.</i>

723
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:47,356
<i>Lexie:
Which is, Arch?</i>

724
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:51,293
<i>Archie: I'm nuts about
her. End of story.</i>

725
00:37:53,163 --> 00:37:55,131
Archie?

726
00:37:55,132 --> 00:37:57,833
It's time, old boy.
You're on.

727
00:37:59,536 --> 00:38:02,704
Don't you think you better
do something about it?

728
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:20,322
For goodness sake,
get on.

729
00:38:20,323 --> 00:38:22,558
Go and say something
to him.

730
00:38:24,827 --> 00:38:27,896
Archie...
I-

731
00:38:27,897 --> 00:38:32,000
come on, my boy. We're
all ready. Over there.

732
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:33,102
Good luck.

733
00:38:36,673 --> 00:38:39,308
Ladies and gentlemen,
the final and deciding

734
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:41,777
<i>test of the challenge.</i>

735
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:45,114
With this challenge
for the great sword

736
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,982
<i>of MacDonald of Glenbogle,</i>

00:38:46,983 --> 00:38:48,517

741
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:04,533
<i>the sacred soil here in
the shadow of Benbogle.</i>

742
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:06,235
<i>Gentlemen...</i>

743
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:10,072
address the sword.

744
00:39:10,073 --> 00:39:11,640
<i>Gentlemen...</i>

745
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:13,875

746
00:39:13,876 --> 00:39:15,877
( crowd cheering )

747
00:40:01,224 --> 00:40:03,692
( yelling )

748
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:21,310
<i>I declare
Archie MacDonald to be</i>

749
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:25,181
<i>the right and true chief

00:40:31,988 --> 00:40:34,122
( chatting )

751
00:40:34,123 --> 00:40:36,392
I failed.

752
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,627
I failed you,

753
00:40:38,628 --> 00:40:41,096
I failed Angus,

754
00:40:41,097 --> 00:40:43,365
in fact,
I failed Joe Jr.

755
00:40:43,366 --> 00:40:44,900
Joe.

756
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,702
I'm scared, Bonnie.

757
00:40:46,703 --> 00:40:48,870
It's like I'm looking
into a black hole,

758
00:40:48,871 --> 00:40:50,839
and there's Joe Jr.
Staring back at me.

759
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,842
Joe, maybe someone
failed him,

760
00:40:53,843 --> 00:40:55,110
maybe you and me,

761
00:40:55,111 --> 00:40:57,045
maybe even himself.

762
00:40:57,046 --> 00:41:00,182
We have to face up
to this,

763
00:41:00,183 --> 00:41:02,851
and we're gonna
do it together,

764
00:41:02,852 --> 00:41:05,020
and we're gonna
do it at home, okay?

765
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,897
Let's go find Ricky.

766
00:41:15,898 --> 00:41:17,999
He needs a father, too.

767
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,469
Hey, guess what
he just called me.

768
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,738
- What?
- Unc Dunc.

769
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:24,139
( laughs )

770
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,141
I've never been
an uncle before.

771
00:41:27,844 --> 00:41:30,479
Hector:
Members of the clan.

772
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,716
The time has come
for me to lay down my burden,

773
00:41:33,717 --> 00:41:37,853
and for a fitter, younger man
to take the reins of office.

774
00:41:39,055 --> 00:41:40,356
My son.

775
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:48,264
Archibald Horatio
Hector MacDonald,

776
00:41:48,265 --> 00:41:52,268
<i>do you pledge
to uphold the traditions</i>

777
00:41:52,269 --> 00:41:54,370
<i>of the MacDonalds
of Glenbogle,</i>

778
00:41:54,371 --> 00:41:56,772
<i>and to keep forever
a home in the hills</i>

779
00:41:56,773 --> 00:41:58,407
<i>for members of the clan</i>

780
00:41:58,408 --> 00:42:00,342
wherever they may
have roamed?

781
00:42:00,343 --> 00:42:02,177
I do so pledge.

782
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,516
I hand to you
the ancient keys

783
00:42:07,517 --> 00:42:09,351
of the house
of MacDonald,

784
00:42:09,352 --> 00:42:11,253
and trust them
to your care.

785
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:19,227
I now pronounce you
chieftain of this proud clan,

786
00:42:19,228 --> 00:42:22,298
and master
of these men assembled.

787
00:42:22,299 --> 00:42:24,500
( cheering )

788
00:42:30,707 --> 00:42:33,208
Well, laddie,
you tell them.

789
00:42:33,209 --> 00:42:36,578
I've been thinking
about this day

790
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:38,647
for most of my life.

791
00:42:38,648 --> 00:42:41,817
Thinking about it, but
never expecting it to happen.

792
00:42:41,818 --> 00:42:45,621
Firstly, because it was
never supposed to be me.

793
00:42:45,622 --> 00:42:48,724
<i>And then when suddenly,</i>

794
00:42:48,725 --> 00:42:50,992
terribly it was,

795
00:42:50,993 --> 00:42:54,062
I ran away
because I didn't want it.

796
00:42:54,063 --> 00:42:56,031
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

797
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,700
<i>And now...</i>

798
00:42:57,701 --> 00:43:00,602
finally...

799
00:43:00,603 --> 00:43:04,039
crazily
I'm standing here...

800
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,074
holding these
funny old keys,

801
00:43:06,075 --> 00:43:08,410
saying those
funny old words,

802
00:43:08,411 --> 00:43:11,680
<i>and all of a sudden
it just seems-</i>

803
00:43:11,681 --> 00:43:13,716
<i>right.</i>

804
00:43:14,917 --> 00:43:16,952
I've made my pledge,

805
00:43:16,953 --> 00:43:19,054
and I will work hard
to keep it.

806
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:23,158
Long live the MacDonalds!

807
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:25,394
( cheering )

808
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:35,404
I want to thank
those people who helped me,

809
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:38,707
and I want them
to come and join me up here.

810
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:44,346
My father and Duncan
are already here.

811
00:43:44,347 --> 00:43:49,385
The best ghillie in Scotland,
Golly MacKenzie.

812
00:43:56,359 --> 00:43:58,827
My dear mother, Molly.

813
00:44:07,637 --> 00:44:11,306
My very,
very best pal, Lexie.

814
00:44:25,922 --> 00:44:28,824
And finally,
our ex-head teacher,

815
00:44:28,825 --> 00:44:31,259
<i>ex-councilor,</i>

816
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,295
but hopefully not
ex-friend,

817
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:34,630
Katrina Finlay.

818
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,432
( crowd applauding )

819
00:44:53,616 --> 00:44:56,017
Is that the best
you can do?

820
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,866
Ahem- right.

821
00:45:10,867 --> 00:45:12,434
Everyone back to the house

822
00:45:12,435 --> 00:45:14,402
for the opening
of the visitors' center,

823
00:45:14,403 --> 00:45:17,773
and the wildest hoolie
in the history of the clan.

824
00:45:17,774 --> 00:45:19,575
( cheering )

825
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:25,313
All: # a moo-moo here
and a moo-moo there #

826
00:45:25,314 --> 00:45:27,483
here a moo, there a moo
everywhere a moo-moo

827
00:45:27,484 --> 00:45:29,485
old MacDonald had a farm

828
00:45:29,486 --> 00:45:31,620
E-I-E-I-O

829
00:45:31,621 --> 00:45:33,655
Old MacDonald had

E-I-E-I-O

831
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:37,726
and on that farm
he had a duck

832
00:45:37,727 --> 00:45:39,528
E-I-E-I-O

833
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:41,697
with a quack-quack here
quack-quack there

834
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:45,367
here a quack, there a quack
everywhere a quack-quack Old MacDonald-

835
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:48,704
<i>- ( brakes squeal )
- Driver, what are you playing at?!</i>

836
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:50,772
It's the bridge.
It's not safe.

837
00:45:50,773 --> 00:45:52,774
It's been there
for 140 years, man!

838
00:45:52,775 --> 00:45:54,543
It's not gonna
fall down now.

839
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:56,478

840
00:45:56,479 --> 00:45:58,213

841
00:45:58,214 --> 00:45:59,915
Go, Hector!

842
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:01,917
<i>All right!</i>

( hooting )

844
00:46:07,824 --> 00:46:09,157
All right, Hector.

845
00:46:09,158 --> 00:46:11,159
- Well done!
- Now, get on!

846
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,461
<i>I take full
responsibility.</i>

847
00:46:13,462 --> 00:46:15,597
Where were we?

848
00:46:15,598 --> 00:46:17,599
Old MacDonald
had a farm

849
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,502
E-I-E-I-O

850
00:46:20,503 --> 00:46:23,572
and on that farm
he had a pig, E-I-

851
00:46:25,107 --> 00:46:27,475
may god bless her,

852
00:46:27,476 --> 00:46:29,545
and all who buy
knickknacks in her.

853
00:46:33,049 --> 00:46:34,750
Would you stop
doing that?

854
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,451
- What?
- Grinning like a loon.

855
00:46:36,452 --> 00:46:38,654
You've done nothing
else for the last hour.

856
00:46:38,655 --> 00:46:41,389
What do you expect? All my
Christmases have come at once.

857
00:46:43,626 --> 00:46:46,028
<i>Hector:
Ahem-hem!</i>

858
00:46:46,029 --> 00:46:46,995
Thank you.

859
00:46:48,364 --> 00:46:49,798
Father?

860
00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:51,633
<i>Are you all right?
What's happened?</i>

861
00:46:53,469 --> 00:46:57,072
I... I think you'd better
come and have a look.

862
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,334
<i>Hector: Shouldn't be
too difficult to fix.</i>

863
00:47:26,335 --> 00:47:29,104
Just the odd
new girder or two.

864
00:47:29,105 --> 00:47:32,240
And the odd
hundred grand.

865
00:47:36,378 --> 00:47:38,614
It's okay.
Be calm.

866
00:47:38,615 --> 00:47:40,548
It's all right.

867
00:47:40,549 --> 00:47:42,484
So this may be
the only way in or out.

868
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:45,954
We'll just have to ferry the
visitors across. It's no big deal.

869
00:47:45,955 --> 00:47:48,724
This sort of thing
happens every day, right?
