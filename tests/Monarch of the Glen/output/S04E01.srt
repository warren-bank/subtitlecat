00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:05,770
<i>( wolves howling )</i>

2
00:00:13,078 --> 00:00:15,046
( growling )

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,736
My father's dream was that
Glenbogle would be great again.

4
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:26,806
One way would have been
to avoid saddling us

5
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:30,243
with a mountain of death duties,
but never mind.

6
00:00:30,244 --> 00:00:33,079
So, we are gonna give
the paying public

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,047
what they most desire-

8
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:38,718
a glimpse
of the dark side.

9
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:41,954
<i>Lexie:
The Glenbogle wolves.</i>

10
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:44,724
<i>They'll be the biggest
draw in the highlands.</i>

11
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:46,926
We'll get visitors
by the coachload.

12
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:49,996
Take more than a few wolves to
raise the kind of money we need.

13
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:54,900
How does "the Glenbogle
Wildlife Center" sound?

14
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:57,003
Bison, wild horses,
native birds,

15
00:00:57,004 --> 00:00:58,871
brought back
to the highlands.

16
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:00,507
Well, I hate to think

17
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:02,708
what your mother'll
say when she gets back.

18
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:33,640
Oh dear, is my hair
a terrible mess?

19
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:38,645
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

20
00:02:13,948 --> 00:02:15,582
My dear brother
sends his love.

21
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,217
- Especially to you, Lexie.
- How is Jolyon?

22
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:20,620
He's doing rather well.
He's broken into green beans.

23
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:22,722
I think he's going to
stay in Kenya for good.

24
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:24,090
Not that I saw
much of him.

25
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:26,926
White-water rafting,
elephant tracking,

26
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:29,496
there is so much to do
for the lone traveler.

27
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:31,163
And the journey?

28
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:33,500
I bought an old Jeep
and drove to Morocco.

29
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:35,502
But that's across
the Sahara desert.

30
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:38,104
You'd hardly expect
me not to notice.

31
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:39,706
And what happened
to the Jeep?

32
00:02:39,707 --> 00:02:42,675
Oh, it got stolen in Tangiers along with the money
- everything.

33
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:45,945
Then an old friend who'd moved to
the Costas for professional reasons

34
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:47,914
gave me a lift
in his tiger moth.

35
00:02:47,915 --> 00:02:49,549
You flew all the way
home in that?

36
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,917
Well, very nearly.

37
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:53,052
But the coast guards
fished us out of the drink

38
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:54,788
and here I am.

39
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:57,189
Oh, I've missed
this old place.

40
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,292
And you.

41
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:08,100
It's your home, Molly.
It's where you belong.

42
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:10,670
Come on, Lexie, you must
fill me in on all the news.

43
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:14,874
Lexie: Well, nothing
much has been happening...

44
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:20,847
you ready for the big day
tomorrow, Golly?

45
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:24,183
- Duncan: Do I have to sit an exam?
- No, just the head keeper.

46
00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:26,218
<i>The guy's name
is Burns,</i>

47
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:28,254
and we only open
on his say-so.

48
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:30,723
Glenbogle's future in the
hands of a zoo inspector?

49
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:34,260
The new wolf's
arriving tomorrow.

50
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:36,496
She'll need collecting
at the station.

51
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:39,265
That sounds like a job
for the head keeper.

52
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:46,072
( barking )

53
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:51,578
That's the alpha female,

54
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,546
<i>the only one with cubs.</i>

55
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:55,348
She's magnificent.

56
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:57,416
Why don't you away in
and get a closer look?

57
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:01,020
( growls )

58
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:04,090
We're not supposed
to get too close.

59
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:06,526
- It frightens them.
- Ah.

60
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:11,564
You know,
Archie's right.

61
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:13,700
Loads of people are gonna
come and see these.

62
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:16,402
- Trippers, yes.
- As long as they pay the entrance fee.

63
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:18,872
Is that all anyone
cares about anymore?

64
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:22,675
Like the boss said, this
estate's going to be great again.

65
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:26,278
No, Duncan, it might be a rich
estate. There is a difference.

66
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:36,055
Where's mother?

67
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:38,491
Probably up to her
neck in hot water.

68
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:41,494
She really
is something, eh?

69
00:04:41,495 --> 00:04:43,396
So are you.

70
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:45,498
Don't.

71
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:48,100
What's the matter?

72
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:50,803
Now that Molly's back,

73
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:52,839
it just feels like
I'm taking over.

74
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,574
Well you are, Lex.

75
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:56,843
You're gonna be the next
lady of Glenbogle

76
00:04:56,844 --> 00:05:00,179
and mother will be only too
happy to pass the mantle on.

77
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,214
Molly's always been
really good to me.

78
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:04,751
It can't be easy
for her

79
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:07,153
just watching
a new model moving in.

80
00:05:09,557 --> 00:05:12,725
I just don't feel good
about it, that's all.

81
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:14,794
Well, I do.

82
00:05:23,037 --> 00:05:24,971
Are you sure that you
should be cuddling

83
00:05:24,972 --> 00:05:26,873
the housekeeper,
your lairdship?

84
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:30,910
- What?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

85
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:34,280
Just reminded me of a
little surprise, that's all.

86
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:36,415
Oh, will I like it?

87
00:05:38,786 --> 00:05:40,753
I thought we said
no secrets.

88
00:05:40,754 --> 00:05:43,422
Yeah, but that's
once we're married.

89
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:46,893
Look, you know I don't want
to rush you into anything.

90
00:05:46,894 --> 00:05:49,528
But?

91
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,798
But, um...

92
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:53,700
no, nothing.
Nothing.

93
00:05:58,205 --> 00:05:59,772
Oh!

94
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:01,741
Can I help you?

95
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:04,477
- I was looking for the kitchen.
- Why?

96
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:06,045
Are you Mrs. MacDonald?

97
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:08,948
- No, not yet.
- I'm sorry for just walking in.

98
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:11,417
There was no one around
and the door was open.

99
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:14,153
So, who are you?

100
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:16,388
I'm Irene Stuart,

101
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:18,257
the new cook
and housekeeper.

102
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:37,810
What is that woman
doing in my kitchen?

103
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:39,979
Who? Oh, she's arrived. Good.

104
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,849
- This is your surprise?
- I really appreciate

105
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,251
how you've looked after us
over the last few months.

106
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:48,087
- Appreciate?
- Carrying on as if nothing had changed.

107
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:50,823
<i>- I really had no right to ask.
- I'm the housekeeper.</i>

108
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:53,726
I've hired Irene to run
the wildlife center catering

109
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:56,129
and I thought she could do
the housekeeping as well.

110
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,998
( laughing )
Over my dead body.

111
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,433
<i>Why, what's the matter? I
thought you'd be pleased.</i>

112
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:03,335
You never even thought
to ask me first?

113
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:05,672
Then it wouldn't have
been a surprise, would it?

114
00:07:05,673 --> 00:07:07,974
- If we're gonna be married-
- if's right.

115
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:11,210
<i>When we're gonna be married, you
can't be the housekeeper, can you?</i>

116
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:13,479
It was the housekeeper
you proposed to.

117
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,715
And it was the laird
that you accepted.

118
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:18,551
So this is a taste of what
being Mrs. Laird's like?

119
00:07:18,552 --> 00:07:21,353
I think I'll stay as I am,
thank you very much.

120
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:22,989
<i>I need you with me.</i>

121
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,158
We've an estate to run,
staff to look after.

122
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:27,026
And this is how you
look after your staff?

123
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:29,996
- But you're not staff.
- Then what am I?

124
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:32,298
You're part of
the management team now.

125
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:34,033
I want to share
everything with you-

126
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:36,703
the running of the estate,
the hiring, the firing.

127
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:39,538
Right, okay, I'll start off
with what's-her-face then.

128
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,875
I can hire and fire with the best
of them, Arch. Especially fire.

129
00:07:44,578 --> 00:07:47,313
- Lex.
- Only if it's important.

130
00:07:47,314 --> 00:07:48,915
I'm management now.

131
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:52,819
Well, that's that sorted.

132
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,121
Seems to be some
misunderstanding.

133
00:07:55,122 --> 00:07:58,124
- Oh?
- See, the post's filled.

134
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,193
But I've come
all this way.

135
00:08:00,194 --> 00:08:02,862
- It was agreed with Mr. MacDonald.
- Sorry.

136
00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:05,932
- I'd better take this up with him.
- No need.

137
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:07,967
If he's given the job
to someone else.

138
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:11,270
He didn't. I'm the cook
so there's no vacancy.

139
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,973
Mr. MacDonald made
me an offer in writing.

140
00:08:13,974 --> 00:08:16,109
You might want to brush up
on your employment law

141
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,077
before you go
any further.

142
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:25,118
See, I don't think you
would like it here anyway,

143
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:27,019
they're a right
difficult lot.

144
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,822
Most of the chefs I've
worked with are on a good day.

145
00:08:29,823 --> 00:08:32,225
I mean, they're on
your back day and night.

146
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:34,961
You've obviously never
worked in a top hotel.

147
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:37,897
- And I suppose you have?
- The Grand Lothian.

148
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:40,566
<i>( laughing )
Not the Grand Lothian?</i>

149
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:45,138
Did you get tired
of peeling veg?

150
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:47,774
I was the sous-chef. That
means I was in charge of-

151
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:49,942
yes, I know
what that means.

152
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:51,710
You've come down
in the world.

153
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,846
I needed a new challenge.

154
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:55,148
Right.

155
00:08:56,683 --> 00:08:59,585
You see, people
only come to Glenbogle

156
00:08:59,586 --> 00:09:01,620
for two reasons:

157
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:03,589
One is to deliver
a final demand

158
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,292
and the other is to
get away from something-

159
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:08,294
- I told you.
- -Or someone.

160
00:09:08,295 --> 00:09:10,696
- I needed a new-
- challenge, right.

161
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:15,802
Well, Irene Stuart, you've
completed your first challenge.

162
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:17,569
You have found
the kitchen.

163
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,438
( chuckling )

164
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:22,975
I thought this would be for the
tourists, "how we used to live. "

165
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:25,511
No, this would be for us,
the way we live now.

166
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:28,281
It has character.

167
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:31,083
So does the Bates Motel but
you wouldn't want to cook in it.

168
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:33,786
If you show me to my
room I'll get changed.

169
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:35,988
Your room?

170
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:37,890
Okay.

171
00:09:41,562 --> 00:09:43,763
Archie: I'm asking
you to set a few traps.

172
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:45,531
They're only rabbits.

173
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:47,634
It would help the
feeding budget go further.

174
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:49,702
They'll just have
to catch their own.

175
00:09:49,703 --> 00:09:52,639
On this estate an animal dies
either from a clean shot or old age.

176
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,641
You and Duncan,
you both do the training.

177
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:56,942
You know what has to be
done. What's at stake.

178
00:09:56,943 --> 00:10:00,413
I will help you
- but as a ghillie, not as a butcher.

179
00:10:00,414 --> 00:10:02,749
Fine.

180
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,820
Before you walk away we have a
season's shooting to start planning.

181
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:09,989
Look, I respect
your principles.

182
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,057
I'm not gonna ask
you to go against them,

183
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:13,926
but I really do believe

184
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,162
that the wildlife park
is the future.

185
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:17,664
<i>That's your plan,
is it?</i>

186
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:20,566
To phase out the traditional
sports in favor of a zoo?

187
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:24,003
We make decent enough
money from the game parties,

188
00:10:24,004 --> 00:10:25,772
<i>I'm not arguing
with that.</i>

189
00:10:25,773 --> 00:10:28,775
<i>But, if and when the
wildlife park takes off,</i>

190
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:30,543
then yes, the emphasis
will change.

191
00:10:30,544 --> 00:10:32,578
- I see.
- As I said-

192
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:35,247
yes, yes, ideas develop,
yes, you said.

193
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:38,351
<i>This is a far cry from a few
wolves to please the punters.</i>

194
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:41,754
What you're talking about is
the slow death of a way of life

195
00:10:41,755 --> 00:10:43,690
that this estate has
depended on for generations.

196
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,828
I'll not be
a party to that.

197
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:51,297
What about the inspector?
The head keeper's exam?

198
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:52,732
Let me ask you
something here.

199
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,834
Would your father have
gone along with this?

200
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:56,669
<i>- Nope.
- no.</i>

201
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,472
Then how in all
good conscience can I?

202
00:10:59,473 --> 00:11:02,775
Well, that all depends where your
loyalties lie, with him or with me.

203
00:11:08,349 --> 00:11:11,917
I'll have Lexie liaise with you
over booking the shoots.

204
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:19,325
How's it going, Dunc?

205
00:11:19,326 --> 00:11:22,294
One electric fence,
fitted and working.

206
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:24,964
- Have they been fed today?
- Golly does that.

207
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:26,699
Not anymore.

208
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,234
That exam.

209
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:30,636
Head keepers only
you said.

210
00:11:30,637 --> 00:11:32,938
As of 10 minutes ago,
you are the head keeper.

211
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,340
That's Golly's job.

212
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:36,308
- He won't do it.
- Why not?

213
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:38,978
He has his reasons, but it's
you that I'm interested in.

214
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:40,747
I don't know.

215
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:42,482
It's a big promotion.

216
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:45,050
More money.

217
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:47,253
Company PlayStation.

218
00:11:49,757 --> 00:11:51,391
It wouldn't be right.

219
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:54,794
There's no one else I can ask,
believe me. If there was I-

220
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:56,763
I wouldn't put you
in this

221
00:11:56,764 --> 00:11:58,898
morally ambiguous
position.

222
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:02,034
What about
the exam though?

223
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:03,669
It's your big chance.

224
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:07,840
- Head keeper?
- You'd best start work.

225
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:12,945
- I won't let you down.
- I know you'll do your best.

226
00:12:12,946 --> 00:12:14,914
Ahh!

227
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:21,954
<i>( knocks, door opens )</i>

228
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:33,699
I shouldn't have gone away
at a time like that but-

229
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,168
no, no.
You did absolutely

230
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:38,571
the right thing.
I totally understand.

231
00:12:38,572 --> 00:12:41,373
And those beastly death
duties still to face.

232
00:12:41,374 --> 00:12:43,443
Yes, 200 grand.
You'd think they'd

233
00:12:43,444 --> 00:12:45,511
name a hospital
after him for that.

234
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:48,614
A ward at the very least.

235
00:12:48,615 --> 00:12:50,049
Um...

236
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,951
I thought we might eat in
the dining room tonight.

237
00:12:51,952 --> 00:12:53,920
Where have you
been eating?

238
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:56,556
The kitchen.

239
00:12:56,557 --> 00:13:00,192
Oh, you'll have your father
haunting you as a class traitor.

240
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:02,361
I wanted you
to be here before we-

241
00:13:02,362 --> 00:13:04,730
reopened
the dining room.

242
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:06,799
Don't stand on ceremony
for me. Eat where you like.


243
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:10,302
The dining room then.

244
00:13:10,303 --> 00:13:12,304
As you wish.

245
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:17,076
I missed you,
Archie.

246
00:13:17,077 --> 00:13:18,945
I missed you too,
mother.

247
00:13:28,288 --> 00:13:31,824
- Who are you?
- Who's asking?

248
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:34,660
- And what are you doing in my freezer?
- Your freezer?

249
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:36,996
Can't you say anything
that isn't a question?

250
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:38,297
Can't you?

251
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:41,266
I'm the housekeeper.

252
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,435
No, you're not.

253
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:45,705
<i>I'm the new housekeeper.
Which brings us back to you.</i>

254
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:49,675
I'm Duncan.
The head ra-

255
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:52,077
the head keeper of the
Glenbogle wildlife center.

256
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,947
Hmm... pleased to meet you,
Duncan.

257
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:57,884
It's Irene.

258
00:13:57,885 --> 00:13:59,785
Head keeper. That's quite a
job. You been doing it long?

259
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:01,387
Aye.

260
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:03,856
Now, what can I
get you to eat?

261
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:07,627
You wouldn't have a few rabbits
kicking about, would you?

262
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:10,496
- A few?
- Yeah, say 20?

263
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:14,433
Golly normally feeds
the wolves

264
00:14:14,434 --> 00:14:16,736
- and I don't know where he gets it.
- Ask.

265
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:19,772
I can't ask-

266
00:14:19,773 --> 00:14:21,674
I have to work this
out for myself.

267
00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:23,609
I doubt he feeds them
from the kitchen freezer.

268
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,377
There must be
a local game dealer.

269
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:27,179
Yeah, and I can
afford his prices.

270
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,882
Aren't there any poachers
left in the highlands?

271
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:31,817
Well, yeah, there's old
Tommy the Shepherd but...

272
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:37,356
your chance remark
might have saved the day.

273
00:14:43,697 --> 00:14:46,398
My dear Molly.

274
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,400
Kilwillie.

275
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:51,403
Home at last
from Africk shores.

276
00:14:53,006 --> 00:14:55,107
Oh, Molly,
what a hollow shell

277
00:14:55,108 --> 00:14:58,844
the world can seem when the
sweetest nut has been removed.

278
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:01,113
Yes... dear Hector.

279
00:15:01,114 --> 00:15:02,815
Hmm?

280
00:15:02,816 --> 00:15:06,586
Oh, Hector, yes.

281
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:08,854
Glenbogle will feel
rather lonely, I dare say.

282
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:11,490
Well, I've got Archie
and Lexie and the boys-

283
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:14,126
- and you of course.
- At your service.

284
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:17,597
Who could possibly
be lonely?

285
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:20,265
I've been admiring
Archie's wolves.

286
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:22,668
Mmm, so many changes.

287
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:25,071
Too many, perhaps?

288
00:15:25,072 --> 00:15:28,373
Well, I intend to make some
myself starting tomorrow.

289
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:31,543
- Oh, can I help, extra pair of hands?
- Would you?

290
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:33,813
I'll be around first
thing in the morning,

291
00:15:33,814 --> 00:15:36,849
shall we say 11:30?

292
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,785
Yes, quite early
enough for a gentleman.

293
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:50,462
No rabbits,
I'll grant you,

294
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:53,499
but I doubt your wolves'll
turn their noses up, eh?

295
00:15:56,436 --> 00:15:59,404
Well, it doesn't say
they can't eat fish.

296
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:03,776
<i>- fresh are they, Tommy?
- Aye.</i>

297
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:08,380
- They're not ours, are they?
- No.

298
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:23,663
You'll want to watch
that water.

299
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:26,766
- It could scald you straight from the tap.
- I will.

300
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:32,938
And that oven runs
at 10 degrees cool.

301
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:35,641
Only nine, I checked.

302
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:42,715
You'll find the silver
cutlery in the dresser.

303
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:45,350
It was in dire need of a good
clean, as was the dining room.

304
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:50,589
This ring
- you'll find it a bit slow if you're used to cooking with gas.

305
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,191
I've cooked
on everything.

306
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:54,593
So, any more questions?

307
00:16:54,594 --> 00:16:57,997
No, thank you. Dinner will
be at 8:00. Until then.

308
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:04,570
<i>( door slams )</i>

309
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:14,279
<i>( electricity crackling )</i>

310
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,148
Fetch.

311
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:18,017
( sizzling )

312
00:17:18,018 --> 00:17:21,286
They like salmon, Dunc,
but not grilled.

313
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:23,255
I just thought I'd
try something different.

314
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:25,758
I know this
is controversial,

315
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,860
but why not use
the feeding tube?

316
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:29,929
I was just away to.

317
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:38,437
Where did you get these?

318
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:40,106
I've got my sources,
Archie.

319
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:42,074
I've got my sources.

320
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:44,043
- They are fresh?
- Oh, aye.

321
00:17:45,545 --> 00:17:47,713
They are ours, yes?

322
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:49,581
Yes.

323
00:17:57,924 --> 00:17:59,792
( growling )

324
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:12,238
Oh, Badger.

325
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:14,874
Lay out my dungarees
for tomorrow, will you?

326
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:18,610
I don't imagine we possess
dungarees, your lordship.

327
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:21,213
Then something appropriate
for manual labor.

328
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:22,748
Very good, m'lord.

329
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:24,383
- Oh, Badger.
- M'lord?

330
00:18:24,384 --> 00:18:26,585
I may have a guest for
dinner tomorrow night.

331
00:18:26,586 --> 00:18:29,321
Make sure the dinning
room is well set out.

332
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:32,391
What hour can we expect
the gentleman, m'lord.

333
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:35,094
The gentleman is a lady.

334
00:18:37,164 --> 00:18:39,031
Golly: I'm sorry, but
I can't get excited

335
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:41,366
over a bunch of howling
dogs taking over the estate.

336
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:44,402
They lived here for centuries before
they were hunted into extinction.

337
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:47,172
I think it would be nice for
people to see them back in the glen.

338
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:48,841
In a pound though, eh?

339
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:51,710
So be it, and seeing how they're native,

340
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:53,746
surely they can survive
without my assistance.

341
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:03,756
You look the part.

342
00:19:03,757 --> 00:19:05,557
<i>Golly:
That you do, lass.</i>

343
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:07,659
Well, looks
aren't everything.

344
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,162
They certainly help,
though.

345
00:19:10,163 --> 00:19:12,197
I think I'd be
more use in the kitchen.

346
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:14,299
You know,
in a managerial sense.

347
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,534
No, I'm quite certain
it's all under control.

348
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:18,670
Do you want a drink?

349
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:20,973
I'm not in the mood.

350
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:27,279
Something the matter?

351
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,115
No, Molly,
you look great.

352
00:19:30,116 --> 00:19:32,117
Thank you.

353
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:34,853
Golly, the pipes.

354
00:19:34,854 --> 00:19:37,322
As you say, Molly.

355
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:40,025
Oh, I am absolutely
starving.

356
00:19:40,026 --> 00:19:42,494
Mother, please.

357
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:44,396
Sweetheart.

358
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:58,443
Duncan, would you?

359
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:02,747
Thank you.

360
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:04,783
<i>( bagpipes playing )</i>

361
00:20:24,437 --> 00:20:26,805
Oh, no, no, Lexie,
you must sit here.

362
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:29,541
But that's
your place, Molly.

363
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,710
I'm so hungry,
I've lost the will to argue.

364
00:20:34,714 --> 00:20:37,415
Archie, you must
sit here, of course.

365
00:20:39,185 --> 00:20:41,086
Come on.

366
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:54,166
Come on, boys.
Don't stand on ceremony.

367
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:56,568
Sit down, join us.

368
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:03,641
Duncan, I'm dying for
a drink, would you pour?

369
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:08,146
You won't believe this,
but that helicopter

370
00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:11,049
didn't even have
a drinks trolley.

371
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:15,187
Ah, that's better.

372
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:17,155
We're all here,
dear friends.

373
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:19,391
<i>We must count
every blessing</i>

374
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:21,393
<i>and cherish
every moment.</i>

375
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:25,230
Thank you.

376
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,533
Good choice, Archie.

377
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:32,104
Ah, supper.

378
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:37,109
Ooh, and what treat have
you got in store for us,

379
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,676
Irene, isn't it?

380
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:40,845
Yes, Mrs. MacDonald.

381
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:43,248
It's seared sea trout
with a chicory flavored

382
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:45,717
tender sauerkraut
and a red wine jus.

383
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:47,752
It looks absolutely...

384
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:50,422
fine.

385
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:56,395
Bon appetit.

386
00:22:01,534 --> 00:22:03,501
( sighs )

387
00:22:11,177 --> 00:22:12,978
Well?

388
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:14,313
Very good.

389
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:17,715
Of its kind, of course.

390
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:21,453
- Is everything all right?
- Excellent, Irene.

391
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:24,556
Mmm, aye.

392
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,061
Yeah, well,
if the main course

393
00:22:29,062 --> 00:22:31,596
is as good as that,
I'll be well satisfied.

394
00:22:31,597 --> 00:22:33,065
That was the main course.

395
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:35,767
( muffled snickering )

396
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:41,306
I'm...
I'm terribly sorry.

397
00:22:42,608 --> 00:22:45,110
<i>I meant no offense.</i>

398
00:22:45,111 --> 00:22:47,912
Well, I'm full.

399
00:23:03,196 --> 00:23:04,863
Will you give it a rest?

400
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:06,898
The exam's tomorrow.

401
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:09,834
I want to be the head
keeper even if you don't.

402
00:23:09,835 --> 00:23:12,404
What brought this on?

403
00:23:12,405 --> 00:23:14,339
I've always played
second fiddle to you

404
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,041
ever since I can remember.

405
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:18,176
<i>It's not that I'm
complaining, mind.</i>

406
00:23:18,177 --> 00:23:21,213
I don't have your
experience. I'm not a ghillie.

407
00:23:21,214 --> 00:23:24,249
But I could
be a head keeper.

408
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,651
You don't think being scared
to death of the creatures

409
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:29,321
is just a wee bit
of a disadvantage, no?

410
00:23:29,322 --> 00:23:31,223
I'm not scared.

411
00:23:31,224 --> 00:23:34,326
I'm in the process
of forming a relationship

412
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:37,295
based on mutual respect.

413
00:23:37,296 --> 00:23:39,564
Well, they haven't
eaten you yet, I suppose.

414
00:23:41,634 --> 00:23:44,169
Why don't you put that down
and get something inside you?

415
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,670
You must be
as hungry as I am.

416
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:47,672
I thought dinner
was very tasty.

417
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:50,208
That kind of modern fanciness
has no place round here.

418
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:52,511
You could give
her a chance.

419
00:23:52,512 --> 00:23:54,379
You might get
to like her.

420
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,748
If her heart's
as big as her portions,

421
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:58,417
I seriously doubt it.

422
00:23:58,418 --> 00:24:01,019
- She's good looking, though.
- Mmm.

423
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:04,289
Too old for me,
eh, Golly?

424
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,525
Old?

425
00:24:06,526 --> 00:24:08,427
That makes me prehistoric.

426
00:24:08,428 --> 00:24:11,163
Get away.
You're in your prime.

427
00:24:11,164 --> 00:24:13,598
- Where are you going?
- The wolf pound.

428
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,133
It'll be dark soon.

429
00:24:15,134 --> 00:24:17,169
A head keeper's place
is with his charges,

430
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,604
not stuffing his face
with bread and cheese.

431
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:27,478
If you were going
to go behind my back,

432
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:30,849
you might as well have hired someone
that could turn out a decent meal.

433
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,618
You're her manager, why
don't you take it up with her?

434
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:36,320
'Cause I didn't
bring her here.

435
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:38,990
I had hoped that you
might give her a chance.

436
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:41,092
What, like you hoped
Golly would welcome

437
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:44,896
your grand plan with
open arms? Get real, Arch.

438
00:24:44,897 --> 00:24:47,165
I am getting real.

439
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:49,568
I'm about the only
one around here who is.

440
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:52,704
If those wolves don't pay off then
we're sunk. That real enough for you?

441
00:24:52,705 --> 00:24:55,273
And you don't care who you
tread on in your progress march?

442
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:56,942
I offered Golly a job,
he turned it down.

443
00:24:56,943 --> 00:24:58,777
No, you asked
Golly to change

444
00:24:58,778 --> 00:25:01,112
his whole way
of life overnight.

445
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:03,448
Now we're getting to it.

446
00:25:03,449 --> 00:25:05,650
At least Golly had
a chance to say no.

447
00:25:05,651 --> 00:25:08,954
- Meaning?
- Meaning you can't ask people to be something

448
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:11,556
that they're not, Arch,
just because you want it.

449
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:14,258
Look, Lex, things are
bound to be different.

450
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:16,294
We're talking
about marriage.

451
00:25:16,295 --> 00:25:18,429
No, you're talking
about marriage.

452
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:25,203
What are you doing?

453
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:27,271
I'm just gonna move
back into my own room.

454
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:31,109
Just for now, eh?

455
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:03,407
- Hi.
- Oh, are you starving, too?

456
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:05,910
No, not really. Here,
sit down. I'll get that.

457
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:07,478
Poor Irene.

458
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:10,348
She'll have to beef up our
portions or we'll all fade away.

459
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:12,416
It's the modern way

460
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:14,853
and you can't teach
a new dog old tricks.

461
00:26:14,854 --> 00:26:16,988
Isn't it an old dog
new tricks?

462
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:19,858
Works both ways.

463
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:21,793
Now, here we are.

464
00:26:24,163 --> 00:26:26,765
Here, now back
your cart in.

465
00:26:26,766 --> 00:26:29,300
Oh, pardon,
bon appetit.

466
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:31,770
Would you like some?

467
00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:33,471
No, I'm fine.

468
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,676
You know, Lexie dear,

469
00:26:37,677 --> 00:26:40,645
it takes time to get used
to a new role. It isn't easy.

470
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:43,114
When you've been
the housekeeper.

471
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:45,917
All families need
new blood.

472
00:26:45,918 --> 00:26:47,886
Life used
to be so certain.

473
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:52,190
I used to be able to read
all the signs and now,

474
00:26:52,191 --> 00:26:55,459
now I can't
even see one.

475
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,962
Golly's finding it hard
too, and so is Archie.

476
00:26:57,963 --> 00:27:00,165
He's lost
his father remember,

477
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:02,701
and I've been useless.

478
00:27:02,702 --> 00:27:05,837
Hector didn't cast
a giant shadow

479
00:27:05,838 --> 00:27:09,107
but he did provide a little
shade, and now he's gone.

480
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:11,209
Archie's feeling
the heat.

481
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,978
Everything depends on
him now, and his plans.

482
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:17,615
Are things
all right between you?

483
00:27:17,616 --> 00:27:19,383
What?

484
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:21,485
Yeah, yeah.

485
00:27:33,132 --> 00:27:35,033
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

486
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:39,337
Lex?

487
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:45,576
What time is it?

488
00:27:45,577 --> 00:27:49,080
I'm on my way out, just thought
I'd see if you were okay.

489
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:51,950
<i>- I'll get you some breakfast.
- no, no, no.</i>

490
00:27:51,951 --> 00:27:53,618
You can't go out
on an empty stomach.

491
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:55,153
I'm fine, really.

492
00:27:55,154 --> 00:27:57,021
It'll take me
five minutes.

493
00:27:57,022 --> 00:27:58,957
Irene was about.
She did me some eggs.

494
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:03,027
Oh.

495
00:28:03,028 --> 00:28:05,163
So you don't need
me then.

496
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,800
Of course I do.

497
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,641
I'd better go see
to the wolves then.

498
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:29,353
<i>Duncan:
She's not eating.</i>

499
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:31,355
<i>She hasn't
moved in ages.</i>

500
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:33,792
You sure about
that salmon?

501
00:28:33,793 --> 00:28:36,494
He said it was fresh.

502
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:38,930
Well, something's
troubling her, poor thing.

503
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:42,733
Perhaps-

504
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:44,936
perhaps she knows that
the new female's coming

505
00:28:44,937 --> 00:28:47,605
and she's feeling
a bit not wanted.

506
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:51,142
They're not people, Dunc.
Don't anthropomorphize.

507
00:28:51,143 --> 00:28:53,311
I'll try not to, boss.

508
00:28:53,312 --> 00:28:55,713
You'll have to get your
skates on after the exam.

509
00:28:55,714 --> 00:28:58,082
The handler will meet you
at the station with the wolf.

510
00:28:59,218 --> 00:29:00,885
She'll be in
a traveling box.

511
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:02,553
Aye, right.

512
00:29:02,554 --> 00:29:04,823
No problem.

513
00:29:04,824 --> 00:29:06,691
They don't attack people,
you know that.

514
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:10,161
Not in the pack,
but this one's on her own.

515
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:13,097
The lone wolf is an
entirely different story.

516
00:29:13,098 --> 00:29:15,366
<i>She won't be alone,
will she?</i>

517
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:17,302
You'll be there.

518
00:29:22,475 --> 00:29:26,010
- Morning.
- Did you sleep well?

519
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:27,979
Eventually...
whilst someone

520
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,981
was up and about
frying sausages.

521
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:31,616
Don't take it personally,

522
00:29:31,617 --> 00:29:33,985
it's just the way you
were taught how to cook.

523
00:29:33,986 --> 00:29:35,820
I was taught the basic
good manners

524
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:37,955
of not invading another
person's work space.

525
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:40,091
I'll bear that in mind.

526
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:41,993
That's...
that's me away.

527
00:29:41,994 --> 00:29:46,097
I thought maybe I'd bring back
a couple of rabbits.

528
00:29:46,098 --> 00:29:48,032
Would that be
a peace offering?

529
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:50,668
It is the finest food
in creation if it's...

530
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:52,803
if it's cooked properly.

531
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:55,540
Hmm. And what are you
going to treat us to?

532
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:58,075
A wee slice of rabbit
on some bruschetta

533
00:29:58,076 --> 00:30:00,411
with a drizzle
of vinaigrette?

534
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:02,614
How would rabbit pie
be for lunch?

535
00:30:02,615 --> 00:30:04,915
Would that get us off
on the right foot?

536
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:07,051
Aye, that would
suit me fine, Irene.

537
00:30:07,052 --> 00:30:09,521
Well, you off and do
your job then,

538
00:30:09,522 --> 00:30:11,422
and I'll do mine.

539
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:17,028
Don't try and cook native.
Just stick to what you know.

540
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:19,664
You think I can't manage
a simple rabbit pie?

541
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:22,567
A complicated one, maybe.
A simple one, I doubt it.

542
00:30:22,568 --> 00:30:24,435
We'll see
about that, won't we?

543
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:26,704
I'll cook lunch.
I'll not see good food ruined.

544
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:28,139
<i>- Ruined?
- yes, ruined.</i>

545
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,542
- ( door opens )
- What's going on?

546
00:30:30,543 --> 00:30:32,076
<i>( dog barks )</i>

547
00:30:32,077 --> 00:30:35,446
- Just girlie talk.
- Talk? I could hear it in the hall.

548
00:30:35,447 --> 00:30:38,349
This person seems to think
she's a better cook than I am.

549
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,786
I only suggested
I cook rabbit pie.

550
00:30:41,787 --> 00:30:43,754
<i>- I am the cook.
- were the cook.</i>

551
00:30:43,755 --> 00:30:46,624
- Are you firing me?
- No one's firing anyone.

552
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:49,394
So, who's to cook lunch?

553
00:30:51,163 --> 00:30:53,164
Irene, perhaps under
the circumstances-

554
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:56,601
you hired me to be
the cook, Mr. MacDonald.

555
00:30:56,602 --> 00:30:58,002
She's right, Lex.

556
00:30:58,003 --> 00:31:00,338
That's it,
take her side.

557
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:03,874
Do you know, there are too many ifs
and maybes in my life at the moment.

558
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:06,143
This one gets
sorted out right now.

559
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:09,046
I'll tell you who's going to cook
- you both are.

560
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:12,750
For the title
housekeeper/cook of Glenbogle.

561
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:16,221
Irene, if you lose, there's still
a job at the wildlife center.

562
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:18,356
Lose? in her dreams.

563
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:22,360
- Who'll judge?
- We all will.

564
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:26,497
Democracy rules.
Rabbit pies at 10 paces.

565
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:28,533
The laird has spoken.

566
00:31:28,534 --> 00:31:30,535
Come on, dogs.

567
00:31:30,536 --> 00:31:33,104
( dogs barking )

568
00:31:40,346 --> 00:31:42,947
We can't have
all this clutter.

569
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:45,683
There's no hurry.

570
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:47,818
No better time
to spring clean,

571
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:51,256
throw open the windows and get
some fresh air into Glenbogle.

572
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:55,860
I thought father had left
all his clothes to Duncan.

573
00:31:55,861 --> 00:31:58,028
Yes, he did.
He's taken what he wants,

574
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:00,798
the rest are going
to the charity shop.

575
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,369
It's about time your father did
something for the deserving poor.

576
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:07,238
Now that he's
not here to object.

577
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,274
Are you taking
all of it?

578
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:11,842
Every last jot
and tittle.

579
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:15,179
<i>I'm glad Monty and Rommel
have taken it so well.</i>

580
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,015
Poor little Useless.

581
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:20,418
<i>They take me
for a walk every day.</i>

582
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:22,019
Always the same...

583
00:32:23,889 --> 00:32:25,856
the same route.

584
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:29,126
Old habits die hard.

585
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:33,665
( whimpering )

586
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:00,491
Am I intruding?

587
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:03,328
Of course not, and
dressed for action, I see.

588
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:05,229
Well, I'm not one
of those who thinks

589
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,132
that manual labor
is a Spanish butler.

590
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:10,935
Spam?

591
00:33:10,936 --> 00:33:14,004
Hector took the nuclear
threat very seriously.

592
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:16,541
There's enough under the
bed to feed a small army.

593
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:18,075
Or small village perhaps.

594
00:33:18,076 --> 00:33:21,479
<i>What about Glenbogle?
Noblesse oblige.</i>

595
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,614
A stack of these, too.

596
00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:27,284
Ah, a full stomach
and a hearty chuckle.

597
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:29,487
Isn't that
just like Hector?

598
00:33:29,488 --> 00:33:31,689
He wanted you
to have these.

599
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,257
You always admired them.

600
00:33:33,258 --> 00:33:35,025
I shall wear them
with pride.

601
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:37,294
They fitted him like
the day they were made.

602
00:33:37,295 --> 00:33:39,364
He kept his figure
to the end.

603
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:44,369
( exhales )

604
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,572
What a blessing
to be a small-boned man.

605
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:53,043
What's the book?

606
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:56,180
I've got an exam
this afternoon.

607
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:58,182
<i>Head keeper business.</i>

608
00:33:58,183 --> 00:34:00,217
You'll be okay.

609
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:02,253
I'm not good
at exams.

610
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:06,491
I mean I liked-
I was good at history

611
00:34:06,492 --> 00:34:08,593
but when it came
to the exam,

612
00:34:08,594 --> 00:34:11,429
I didn't even remember how
long the 100 years war lasted.

613
00:34:12,865 --> 00:34:15,566
Like cooking, it's all
in the preparation.

614
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:17,268
Give me the book.

615
00:34:17,269 --> 00:34:20,170
And I've got to pick up
the new wolf from the station.

616
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:22,106
One thing at a time.

617
00:34:22,107 --> 00:34:25,209
So, the ancient wolf's
natural prey?

618
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,714
Red deer, giant deer,

619
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:31,516
megalosaurus,

620
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:34,452
wild horse,

621
00:34:34,453 --> 00:34:38,355
wild ox,

622
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:40,257
wild...

623
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:45,162
hare.

624
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:50,735
( bell jingles )

625
00:34:50,736 --> 00:34:53,504
Well, that's
the hard part done.

626
00:34:53,505 --> 00:34:55,105
<i>Courage, mon brave.</i>

627
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:57,074
If I had your courage,
Molly.

628
00:34:57,075 --> 00:34:59,410
We must both be brave
and count on each other.

629
00:34:59,411 --> 00:35:01,679
This lot'll
go down well.

630
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,749
It's rather heart-warming to
think that the poor of Africa

631
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,318
will enjoy the bracing
chafe of the tweed.

632
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:10,321
- It doesn't work like that.
- We sell them here.

633
00:35:10,322 --> 00:35:14,224
- Oh.
- That'll be one of ours, I dare say.

634
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:16,226
My dear good woman,

635
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:18,596
all my attire comes
from Savile Row.

636
00:35:18,597 --> 00:35:21,332
We have branches
everywhere.
637
00:35:25,136 --> 00:35:28,105
Now you mustn't become
a stranger to Glenbogle.

638
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:29,707
Nor you
to Kilwillie castle.

639
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:31,509
As a matter of fact,
I've just added

640
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,478
a particularly delicious
vino to my cellar

641
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:35,513
which it would be
sacrilege to drink alone.

642
00:35:35,514 --> 00:35:39,416
- Perhaps you'd join me?
- It's a little early, even for me.

643
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:42,052
- This evening?
- I've so much to do.

644
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:44,856
We could take a turn
in the launch.

645
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:48,325
Shall we say 6:30?

646
00:35:50,428 --> 00:35:52,262
Good.

647
00:35:57,903 --> 00:36:00,037
Ah, the hunter
home from the hill.

648
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,043
- Where are they?
- I'm afraid there were no rabbits to be had.

649
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:08,045
Golly,
the estate's overrun,

650
00:36:08,046 --> 00:36:10,882
I mean they breed like-
like rabbits.

651
00:36:10,883 --> 00:36:13,217
Nonetheless.

652
00:36:13,218 --> 00:36:15,486
So, how's it all going?

653
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:18,355
- Wee problem. - Nimrod
has returned empty-handed.

654
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:21,358
Maybe the rabbits moved out
when the wolves moved in.

655
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,328
Golly, I know they have
sensitive noses but-

656
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:27,364
Archie, those wolves create
a terrible strong odor.

657
00:36:31,403 --> 00:36:34,939
- I guess lunch is off then.
- We could have the competition at dinner.

658
00:36:36,842 --> 00:36:38,676
Fine.

659
00:36:38,677 --> 00:36:40,578
It's your turn
to decide the menu, Lex.

660
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:42,880
Oh, we are in
for a gastronomic treat.

661
00:36:44,315 --> 00:36:45,883
Cullen skink!

662
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:48,185
Cullen skink?

663
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:50,387
Cullen-
excuse us.

664
00:36:51,857 --> 00:36:53,758
Come here.

665
00:36:58,096 --> 00:36:59,797
What?

666
00:36:59,798 --> 00:37:02,667
Of all the things, you choose
some obscure highland fish stew.

667
00:37:02,668 --> 00:37:04,769
She's probably
never heard of it.

668
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,472
- It just popped into my head.
- You really want to win, don't you?

669
00:37:08,473 --> 00:37:11,809
I want to marry you and you'd
rather be my housekeeper.

670
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,878
You're gonna have to
make your mind up, Lex.

671
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:29,794
Golly?

672
00:37:29,795 --> 00:37:32,196
Golly!

673
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:37,101
I'm just getting out of your
way now your zoo man's arrived.

674
00:37:37,102 --> 00:37:41,405
- You still work here. - But if he asks me,
I'm gonna have to give him my opinion.

675
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:43,874
You don't want a conscientious
objector around on a day like this.

676
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:46,210
No, I want somebody
who understands animals.

677
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:49,981
All I know I've learnt from a book. He's
an expert, he'll see right through me.

678
00:37:49,982 --> 00:37:53,918
- I'm sorry, son, but this was your decision,
not mine. - You're leaving me to it?

679
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:56,621
No, I'm going to do the
job that I was hired to do.

680
00:37:56,622 --> 00:38:00,290
- By my father. - Oh- okay,
Archie, maybe you're right.

681
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:03,193
Let's just forget what's gone,
get rid of the baggage.

682
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:05,429
I mean, who cares?

683
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,364
That's not the way
I feel, Golly.

684
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:10,501
No.

685
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,606
I know you don't.

686
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:21,578
<i>( clock chiming )</i>

687
00:38:26,384 --> 00:38:29,053
Don't you want to check
your answers, Mr. McKay?

688
00:38:29,054 --> 00:38:31,922
I've got a train to meet.
I'm late already.

689
00:38:35,694 --> 00:38:37,628
Duncan, slow down.

690
00:38:37,629 --> 00:38:40,230
<i>- is there a wolf chasing you?
- It's worse than that.</i>

691
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:42,066
Is Arch giving you
a hard time, too?

692
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:43,934
No, I've got to go
pick up the new wolf

693
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:45,636
and Burns is here
for the inspection

694
00:38:45,637 --> 00:38:48,739
and we can't open without him
and Archie's really worried

695
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,341
and... and... and he's depending on me.

696
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:54,278
On you?

697
00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:56,213
Aye, great, isn't it?

698
00:39:04,556 --> 00:39:08,125
Well, your man's scraped
through the written paper.

699
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:09,860
Well done, Duncan.

700
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:12,863
Skin of his teeth,
but he made it.

701
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:16,067
The important thing is that
he's good with the animals.

702
00:39:16,068 --> 00:39:18,035
Oh, absolutely.

703
00:39:30,015 --> 00:39:31,949
Here's Duncan now.

704
00:39:36,254 --> 00:39:38,122
<i>Burns: Oh, you're going ahead with it?</i>

705
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:40,457
Aye. I'm not
scared of them.

706
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:42,693
You put a strange wolf
into the pack now,

707
00:39:42,694 --> 00:39:44,829
they'll probably rip
her to pieces!

708
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:50,101
They...

709
00:39:50,102 --> 00:39:51,602
they don't attack
their own.

710
00:39:51,603 --> 00:39:53,738
Well, you can kiss
your certificate goodbye

711
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:57,274
until you can find someone
that has the slightest inkling

712
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:59,110
of what they're doing.

713
00:40:02,748 --> 00:40:04,581
What's the problem?

714
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:07,351
Burns doesn't want me to put
the new wolf in with the others.

715
00:40:07,352 --> 00:40:09,586
He has got a point, the
alpha female is pregnant.

716
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:12,656
<i>You can't
sense it?</i>

717
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:16,293
<i>- Burns: who's he?
- That's our ghillie.</i>

718
00:40:27,338 --> 00:40:29,273
( latch clicks )

719
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,411
<i>Golly:
Easy, easy.</i>

720
00:40:34,412 --> 00:40:36,213
Easy.

721
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,685
Easy, good girl.

722
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:46,190
Good girl.

723
00:40:46,191 --> 00:40:47,958
That's it.

724
00:41:02,774 --> 00:41:04,975
Go, go.

725
00:41:10,081 --> 00:41:11,849
Easy, easy.

726
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,951
Good girl, that's it.

727
00:41:16,221 --> 00:41:18,422
No one means you
the slightest harm.

728
00:41:18,423 --> 00:41:21,058
You can still be
the boss of the pack.

729
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,262
- Easy, easy.
- ( wolf whining )

730
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:27,631
You show some respect
for your elders.

731
00:41:27,632 --> 00:41:31,135
You might learn
something.

732
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,270
Here.

733
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:34,872
That's a girl.

734
00:41:34,873 --> 00:41:37,141
That's a girl,
get the scent.

735
00:41:37,142 --> 00:41:41,111
Good girl. see?
Nothing to worry about.

736
00:41:41,112 --> 00:41:43,981
May come in handy
for the babysitting.

737
00:41:43,982 --> 00:41:46,083
Good girl,
easy, easy.

738
00:41:47,585 --> 00:41:49,353
Good girl.

739
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:08,973
<i>Burns:
He's a natural.</i>

740
00:42:08,974 --> 00:42:11,842
Providing he takes the exam
you've got your head keeper

741
00:42:11,843 --> 00:42:14,178
and your license.

742
00:42:14,179 --> 00:42:15,913
Well?

743
00:42:17,548 --> 00:42:20,450
Well, it is not what
I'm used to, Archie,

744
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:23,587
but if you ask me
to do the job,

745
00:42:23,588 --> 00:42:26,123
I'll do it.

746
00:42:26,124 --> 00:42:28,058
Thank you.

747
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:31,762
Sorry, son.

748
00:42:33,464 --> 00:42:35,465
I handled it badly,
Golly.

749
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:37,534
That you did.

750
00:42:37,535 --> 00:42:39,069
Not just you.

751
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,670
I really messed up
with Lex.

752
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:42,873
I don't know how I could
have been so thoughtless.

753
00:42:42,874 --> 00:42:44,508
You had a lot
to deal with,

754
00:42:44,509 --> 00:42:47,411
but now is the time
to mend some bridges.

755
00:42:47,412 --> 00:42:49,113
What about Duncan?

756
00:42:49,114 --> 00:42:50,915
Mightily
disappointed.

757
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:53,717
But he's young,
he can take the knocks.

758
00:42:53,718 --> 00:42:56,720
The older you get,
the harder that becomes.

759
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:03,260
( laughing )

760
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:22,712
My granny taught me
how to cook.

761
00:43:22,713 --> 00:43:24,848
She taught me
everything I know.

762
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:27,884
I used to dream
of living in a castle

763
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:29,786
and cooking for
a great family.

764
00:43:29,787 --> 00:43:32,256
Is that still
what you want?

765
00:43:32,257 --> 00:43:35,092
- What if it is? You're here.
- True.

766
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:37,527
It's a far cry
from the Grand Lothian.


767
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:40,697
I made a mistake. Is that
what you want to hear?

768
00:43:40,698 --> 00:43:43,100
A mistake?
And you ended up here?

769
00:43:43,101 --> 00:43:45,436
What did you do,
poison the president?

770
00:43:45,437 --> 00:43:47,537
It wasn't a professional
mistake, and no,

771
00:43:47,538 --> 00:43:49,440
I didn't poison
the president.

772
00:43:49,441 --> 00:43:51,108
I won him over,
actually.

773
00:43:52,143 --> 00:43:54,445
<i>- Not the president.
- He was then.</i>

774
00:43:54,446 --> 00:43:57,581
Bill Clinton spent a night in
the hotel and I cooked for him.

775
00:43:57,582 --> 00:44:00,550
So, you see, I was destined
to be in the kitchen.

776
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:03,087
Maybe I am too.

777
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:08,725
So, what did you
cook Mr. Clinton?

778
00:44:08,726 --> 00:44:10,394
What I'm best
known for.

779
00:44:10,395 --> 00:44:12,629
My signature dish
if you like.

780
00:44:14,299 --> 00:44:16,266
Cullen skink.

781
00:44:21,306 --> 00:44:24,375
That was so exhilarating.

782
00:44:24,376 --> 00:44:28,012
The wind and the spray, oh,
you really must try it sometime.

783
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:32,649
"A.E.S. Kilwillie,
Eton, second 11." Oh...

784
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:37,121
well, I was quite an
all-rounder in those days.

785
00:44:37,122 --> 00:44:40,491
- Delicious.
- You must have another one.

786
00:44:40,492 --> 00:44:42,792
Or, perhaps
something to eat.

787
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:44,561
<i>Nothing formal,
you understand,</i>

788
00:44:44,562 --> 00:44:47,498
just whatever
the kitchen can muster.

789
00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:49,199
I really must get back.

790
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,702
Our new housekeeper is pitting
her skills against Lexie tonight.

791
00:44:52,703 --> 00:44:55,972
There'll be tears before
bedtime. Another time perhaps.

792
00:44:55,973 --> 00:44:58,275
Yes.

793
00:44:58,276 --> 00:45:00,777
Another time.

794
00:45:13,424 --> 00:45:15,659
Look, Lexie,

795
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,795
we don't have
to do this.

796
00:45:17,796 --> 00:45:20,130
I was wrong,
I'm sorry.

797
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:24,267
Irene can work
at the wildlife center,

798
00:45:24,268 --> 00:45:26,103
you can carry on here.
What do you say?

799
00:45:28,907 --> 00:45:31,141
Let battle commence.

800
00:45:34,846 --> 00:45:36,880
Thank you.

801
00:45:39,183 --> 00:45:40,851
Well done, Irene.

802
00:45:40,852 --> 00:45:42,786
A new take
on an old favorite.

803
00:45:44,255 --> 00:45:46,556
<i>Golly:
Yes, it's very nice.</i>

804
00:45:46,557 --> 00:45:49,860
Though haddock were just
a wee bit bigger in my day.

805
00:45:49,861 --> 00:45:52,930
Never mind. You can
fill up on Lex's later.

806
00:45:52,931 --> 00:45:56,133
<i>- eh, Lex?
- One thing at a time, Duncan.</i>

807
00:45:56,134 --> 00:45:58,769
I'm sorry I'm late but
Kilwillie absolutely insisted

808
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,105
on dragging me out
on the loch.

809
00:46:01,106 --> 00:46:03,440
And how is Kilwillie?

810
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:39,076
That was absolutely
delicious.

811
00:46:39,077 --> 00:46:40,544
Thank you.

812
00:46:40,545 --> 00:46:42,813
Don't worry, left plenty
of room for yours, Lex.

813
00:46:42,814 --> 00:46:45,482
So you've
really done it.

814
00:46:45,483 --> 00:46:47,918
You've made your choice?

815
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,354
Yeah.

816
00:46:59,998 --> 00:47:01,799
No more doubts.

817
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,934
No more cooking?

818
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,669
Why would I want
to be in the kitchen

819
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,637
when I could be here

820
00:47:07,638 --> 00:47:09,940
at my own table

821
00:47:09,941 --> 00:47:12,509
with my own man?

822
00:47:20,085 --> 00:47:22,519
Duncan: So that's a no
to the cullen skink then?

823
00:47:24,622 --> 00:47:27,958
I still can't believe you
got engaged with a ring pull.

824
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:30,227
It's all we could
find at the time.

825
00:47:33,899 --> 00:47:37,567
- The new wolf seems to have fitted in fine.
- Well enough.

826
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:40,237
I think it's great, this
wildlife center idea.

827
00:47:40,238 --> 00:47:42,706
Makes life
more interesting.

828
00:47:42,707 --> 00:47:45,175
Well, you're young.

829
00:47:45,176 --> 00:47:49,046
You're not old, Golly.
You're- experienced.

830
00:47:50,115 --> 00:47:51,982
Some women like that.

831
00:47:51,983 --> 00:47:53,850
For example?

832
00:47:53,851 --> 00:47:55,585
No one in particular.

833
00:47:55,586 --> 00:47:58,355
You can put all such ideas
right out of your head, Duncan.

834
00:47:58,356 --> 00:48:01,926
She's a looker,
and sophisticated.

835
00:48:01,927 --> 00:48:04,094
I've no mind
to go courting Irene.

836
00:48:05,496 --> 00:48:08,532
Aye, like you'd no
mind to be head keeper,

837
00:48:08,533 --> 00:48:10,867
but here you are.

838
00:48:17,775 --> 00:48:19,810
What do you think,
Lexie?

839
00:48:19,811 --> 00:48:23,180
This yellow for the
golden sands of the Sahara

840
00:48:23,181 --> 00:48:26,616
or the blue
of the African sky?

841
00:48:26,617 --> 00:48:28,953
Yellow.

842
00:48:28,954 --> 00:48:31,088
Yellow's more... cheerful.

843
00:48:31,089 --> 00:48:32,990
Then yellow it is.

844
00:48:34,826 --> 00:48:36,560
Um...

845
00:48:36,561 --> 00:48:39,163
I've been thinking
about my room.

846
00:48:39,164 --> 00:48:41,631
Redecorating?

847
00:48:41,632 --> 00:48:45,269
Moving out... and moving
into Archie's room.

848
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:49,073
- May I ask- - if you
don't approve, it's fine.

849
00:48:49,074 --> 00:48:51,741
May I ask what has
taken you so long, Lexie?

850
00:48:51,742 --> 00:48:55,346
Love is precious, every single
moment of it. Don't waste it.

851
00:48:55,347 --> 00:48:57,414
<i>You're not young
forever,</i>

852
00:48:57,415 --> 00:48:59,450
even if you're
in love forever.

853
00:49:01,453 --> 00:49:04,621
Are you?
In love forever?

854
00:49:07,492 --> 00:49:10,327
Now, when Archie
drives you mad,

855
00:49:10,328 --> 00:49:12,729
<i>which he will from time
to time, you can move</i>

856
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:15,565
into Hector's old room.
I'm going to decorate it next.

857
00:49:15,566 --> 00:49:18,568
Something very warm

858
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:21,271
and very colorful,
don't you think?

859
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:41,992
What's this?

860
00:49:41,993 --> 00:49:46,330
Archie MacDonald, will you
take this former brainless idiot

861
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:48,832
to be your lawful
wedded wife?

862
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:54,971
Yes.

863
00:49:56,807 --> 00:49:58,942
But...

864
00:49:58,943 --> 00:50:01,011
there is one condition.

865
00:50:01,012 --> 00:50:02,812
Oh, yes?

866
00:50:04,182 --> 00:50:06,983
Do you think that
we might improve

867
00:50:06,984 --> 00:50:08,818
on a ring pull?

868
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:11,188
You stingy,
Scottish cheapskate.

869
00:50:11,189 --> 00:50:14,258
That is nothing to what
my mother called me.

870
00:50:19,997 --> 00:50:21,865
But that's Molly's.

871
00:50:21,866 --> 00:50:23,534
She wanted you
to have it.

872
00:50:34,412 --> 00:50:36,947
So, we do get
our fairy tale ending.

873
00:50:57,935 --> 00:51:00,704
Good night, Mr. Laird.

874
00:51:00,705 --> 00:51:02,973
Good night, Mrs. Laird.
