1
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,735
Justine.

2
00:00:18,736 --> 00:00:20,570
Did you sleep
all right?

3
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:23,406
- Eventually, thanks.
- I missed you.

4
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:25,942
Come back to bed.

5
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,111
Are you sure?

6
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:30,681
I'm sorry, there's
no need to quarrel,

7
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:33,784
Especially when I've
come all this way.

8
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:36,186
I only wanted to know who was
looking after the restaurant.

9
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:37,688
What?

10
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:39,923
You're asking me who's
looking after the restaurant?

11
00:00:39,924 --> 00:00:41,158
I just meant-

12
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:43,160
( sighing )
it's okay.

13
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:45,295
<i>Let's just
forget about it.</i>

14
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:48,298
Let's just...
( sighs )

15
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,333
Yeah, let's.

16
00:00:56,874 --> 00:00:58,709
<i>Archie: We make a right pair, don't we?</i>

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,443
<i>Justine: A good pair, I thought.</i>

18
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:03,714
Let's make the most
of the next couple of days, huh?

19
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:05,481
I'd like that.

20
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,850
Just the two of us.

21
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,120
( clears throat )

22
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:14,457
Sorry.
You've got visitors.

23
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,059
Who is it?

24
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:20,263
Julie Andrews
and the Von Trapp family.

25
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:22,398
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,969
- Just hold that there.
- Katrina.

27
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,503
Good morning.

28
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:01,537
Shona...

29
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,207
Mr. MacDonald,

30
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,609
We'd like to thank you,
on behalf of the school,

31
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,811
For your generosity

32
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:10,013
<i>In donating land
for our new gym,</i>

33
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:12,015
<i>Which will be
a valuable resource</i>

34
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:14,818
For the whole community
of Glenbogle.

35
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,119
Why, thank you.

36
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,189
- That's you wearing a kilt.
- All right.

37
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,795
Thanks.

38
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:27,264
I'm sorry we got off
on the wrong foot.

39
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:30,867
And I was thinking,

40
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:33,003
If you really want a hand
with the estate accounts,

41
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:35,806
I'd be happy to help out...
Until you got someone better.

42
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,441
No, no, you'd be great.
I'll take you up on that.

43
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:42,512
Okay kids, say goodbye
to Mr. MacDonald.

44
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:46,249
All:
Goodbye, Mr. MacDonald.

45
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,185
<i>Goodbye.
Thank you.</i>

46
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:53,389
Thanks,
that was really nice.

47
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,657
Archie?

48
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:58,795
Oh, sweetheart,
I was just-

49
00:02:58,796 --> 00:03:01,064
I thought you
were never coming.

50
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:02,598
Morning.

51
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,868
<i>Aren't you going
to introduce me?</i>

52
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:06,769
Oh, right. Um...

53
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,272
Justine, this is Katrina.
Katrina, Justine.

54
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,375
Hi.

55
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,327
<i>So, what are you two
going to do today?</i>

56
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:32,362
<i>- Hunting? Fishing?
- Definitely not.</i>

57
00:03:32,363 --> 00:03:34,530
The business with the hook,
in the fish's mouth.

58
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:39,302
Actually, I thought
we'd just hang out together.

59
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,271
Hang what out?

60
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:43,740
Take no notice
of my husband, Justine.

61
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:45,375
He's a very rude man.

62
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:48,011
Quality time.
You know.

63
00:03:49,847 --> 00:03:51,381
Is this-

64
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:53,483
...Porridge.

65
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:54,985
Is it gluten free?

66
00:03:56,254 --> 00:03:58,388
( sighs )

67
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:00,790
Archie: Justine, are you
sure about those shoes?

68
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,293
No, but I certainly
wasn't putting my feet

69
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:05,028
Into your dad's
old wellies.

70
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:06,863
They can go for a walk
on their own.

71
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:08,999
Oh, aren't they
sweet, Hector?

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,800
Do you remember when
we were like that,

73
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:12,602
Star-crossed
young lovers?

74
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:14,404
Molly, please,
act your age.

75
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:17,140
Why don't we hang out
together? Just like them?

76
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:19,475
Well why? What would
be the point of that?

77
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:25,315
What do you think
of her, then?

78
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:27,150
A bit gothic.

79
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:28,885
A bit forbidding.

80
00:04:28,886 --> 00:04:30,820
A bit of a monstrosity.

81
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:32,455
Monstrosity?

82
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:36,226
I can see you're
very attached to it.

83
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:40,030
You must admit, it is like
the house in "Psycho. "

84
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,932
Remind me not
to have a shower.

85
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,599
That's all right,
'cause there aren't any.

86
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,101
Not just yet, anyway.

87
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:50,440
Now, who's that, then?

88
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,544
What's he up to?

89
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:01,551
<i>Hector:
Morning, boys.</i>

90
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,219
<i>Long time, no see.
A bit busy, then?</i>

91
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,887
Quiet of late, sir.

92
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,190
Since we finished
the nuclear power plant.

93
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:09,292
Right, jolly good.
I'll lead on, then.

94
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:14,464
Just wait here,
will you, Justine?

95
00:05:14,465 --> 00:05:16,666
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Archie!?

96
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,868
Where are you going?
I want to talk to you!

97
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:20,971
( insects buzzing )

98
00:05:20,972 --> 00:05:23,340
Ooh-ugh.

99
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:25,241
Biting things!

100
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:31,714
<i>Man:
Eight foot...</i>

101
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:34,817
Four inches.

102
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:36,486
I've never understood
this modern obsession

103
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:38,621
For having a lavatory
within five feet of the bed.

104
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:40,656
Weak bladder,
weak mind.

105
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:42,225
Quite.

106
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:46,296
<i>- What's going on?
- MacSween brothers, Archie.</i>

107
00:05:46,297 --> 00:05:48,465
Probably last saw the boy
in short trousers.

108
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:52,102
Aye.

109
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:54,871
Father, can I have a word?

110
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:56,306
<i>Yeah.</i>

111
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,248
Archie!

112
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:06,782
What are
you doing?

113
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,784
You said we needed builders
to tart the place up

114
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,354
For your precious paying guests.
So I telephoned the MacSweens.

115
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:13,956
- But father- - I thought you'd
be pleased. It's what you wanted.

116
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,426
Well, yes but...
Are they any good?

117
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:18,895
- They're very reasonable.
- They're not, are they?

118
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:21,197
Don't tell me they're the
ones that did the rewiring?

119
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:24,034
Their family has done all the
maintenance on the house since the war.

120
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:26,136
Good heavens. Their great
grandfather built it.

121
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:27,870
I was going to get
a firm in from Inverness,

122
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:29,539
Edinburgh even,
somewhere with a bit more-

123
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,374
One thing about
being the Laird,

124
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,044
You spend close to home,
support local people.

125
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:35,711
That way, you keep
the peace, all right?

126
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,854
Very well.
One condition.

127
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:47,590
I'm in charge.
I supervise everything.

128
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:49,325
All right.

129
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:57,067
- Golly?
- Uh-huh.

130
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:59,235
Can I ask
you something?

131
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:01,871
Wish you would. You've been
building up to it all day.

132
00:07:01,872 --> 00:07:04,907
<i>Well, the thing is,</i>

133
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:06,842
I've got two tickets
to the ball.

134
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,578
Ach, that's awful
sweet of you, Duncan,

135
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:10,646
But, I have to wash
the dogs tomorrow night.

136
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,516
No.

137
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:17,587
<i>- The thing is-
- you want to take Lexie,</i>

138
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:19,755
But you don't know how
to ask her.

139
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:20,990
How did you know that?

140
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:23,460
Just tell her
you want to take her.

141
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:27,964
But how?

142
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:30,533
Oh, Duncan, Duncan,
Duncan.

143
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:31,734
Just tell her
that she's...

144
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:34,170
The bonniest lass
north of Perth

145
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:36,239
<i>And you want to prove it
by taking her</i>

146
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,309
To the premier event
in Scotland's social calendar.

147
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,010
Right.

148
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,513
Okay.

149
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,349
That's it.

150
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,684
Hello? It's me.

151
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,220
Are we on, then?

152
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:53,223
Ooh, you terrible man.

153
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:55,691
I feel wonderfully
conspiratorial.

154
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:57,293
See you in a trice.

155
00:07:57,294 --> 00:07:59,729
� I feel pretty �

156
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,498
� oh, so pretty
I feel pretty- �

157
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:02,798
You look it.

158
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,667
Thank you.
What's an old maid to do?

159
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:05,901
Are you going out?

160
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,571
<i>- Yes, dear.
- You go out Fridays.</i>

161
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,106
Poodle 'round
Inverness fridays.

162
00:08:10,107 --> 00:08:13,343
- I know.
- Today isn't Friday.

163
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:16,112
Where would we be without your
razor-like intelligence, dear?

164
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,451
<i>( door closes )</i>

165
00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:22,918
Now, this is important.

166
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,889
Not this room, okay?

167
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,725
- Not this room.
- I'll put a cross on it.

168
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:33,763
- Blasphemy.
- Sideways cross.

169
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:41,771
- All right?
- Nothing that a hot bath

170
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:44,040
And some hydrocortizone
won't fix.

171
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:47,076
Right.

172
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:50,980
These five bedrooms,
right here...

173
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,093
( car honks )

174
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:17,307
Ah, that shocked ya
right enough, eh?

175
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:19,342
Geordie, what's this?
Is it new?

176
00:09:19,343 --> 00:09:20,743
A gambling debt.

177
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:23,313
It was either this,
or a full set of broken fingers.

178
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:25,448
How thrilling.
You're joking?

179
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:27,584
That's the thing
with Geordie McCann,

180
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:30,486
You never quite know.
She's a beauty, eh?

181
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,323
- Ohh.
- And look, shoes to match.

182
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:35,625
<i>Oh, my.</i>

183
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:37,360
Leather. Italian.

184
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:39,729
<i>- Hand-tooled.
- They look it.</i>

185
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,931
You've got to hand it
to the Italians,

186
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:43,833
They know about style.

187
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,502
What can I say, Geordie?
You've done it again.

188
00:09:57,715 --> 00:09:59,115
Lexie?

189
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:02,352
What are you... Doing?

190
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:03,686
Nothing fancy.

191
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,288
Just a leg of mince.

192
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:09,024
You won't be cooking
tomorrow night.

193
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,729
It's my night off too.

194
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,998
What do you want me
to do, bake you a cake?

195
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:21,971
It's the Glenbogle Ball.
Would you-

196
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:24,440
Would you like
to come with me?

197
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:26,075
With you?

198
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:27,843
Why would
I want to do that?

199
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:32,848
Because you're the bonniest
lass north of Perth,

200
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:34,517
And I want to prove it
by taking you

201
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:37,353
To the premier event
in Scotland's social calendar.

202
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:38,988
Oh, I see.

203
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,726
- Did you get that guff from Golly?
- No.

204
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:47,163
Um... Yes.

205
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:50,833
Right.

206
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:52,835
Okay.

207
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:55,171
- What?
- I'll come with you.

208
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:57,940
Oh, right.

209
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:04,814
<i>Yes!</i>

210
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:08,984
Every single time, Lewis.

211
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:10,586
<i>Do I have to show you
everything?</i>

212
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,855
<i>You do the humpin',
I'll do the thinkin'</i>

213
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:15,157
Archie?

214
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:17,327
- You're great at that.
- Brothers...

215
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:19,094
<i>Who needs 'em.</i>

216
00:11:22,132 --> 00:11:23,700
Archie?

217
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:48,658
<i>- Hector: Who's there?
- It's me.</i>

218
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:50,192
<i>Hector:
Who's that?</i>

219
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:52,962
Oh, it's you.

220
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:56,899
I was looking for Archie,
and I found his old room.

221
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,268
- It's Jamie's.
- Jamie?

222
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:00,436
Archie's brother.

223
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:02,304
Brother?
I never knew he had-

224
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,139
He died, some years ago.

225
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,710
I'm very sorry.

226
00:12:07,711 --> 00:12:09,612
Look,
this is private.

227
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:11,280
No one comes in here
except Molly and me.

228
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:15,317
I didn't mean to intrude.

229
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:18,020
There's really nothing much
to see, anyways.

230
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:19,622
It's just full of...

231
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:20,790
Old things.

232
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,034
Sorry.

233
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:43,279
<i>Who did that?</i>

234
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,251
Damn useless.

235
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:54,390
Archie, do you know
why I came up here?

236
00:12:54,391 --> 00:12:55,858
To ravish my body?

237
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,027
Would be nice
to get the chance.

238
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,430
I came to see what
you were doing here,

239
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:02,064
And if you
were coming back.

240
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:04,967
- Of course I'm coming back.
- Are you?

241
00:13:04,968 --> 00:13:07,804
Justine, there's things to be done here
- the renovation.

242
00:13:07,805 --> 00:13:09,872
I've got to get a
business structure sorted.

243
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,240
But, it won't
take long.

244
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:12,875
We'll soon
be together again.

245
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,010
You never told me
about Jamie, either.

246
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:17,513
What happened?

247
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:18,915
It's a long story.

248
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,483
I'll tell you
another time, okay?

249
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:22,251
Right.

250
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:24,186
Tell me about
Katrina, then.

251
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:26,088
Katrina?

252
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:27,690
<i>Archie?!</i>

253
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:29,291
Justine,
they're only sheep.

254
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:30,693
What about when you get

255
00:13:30,694 --> 00:13:32,995
Foot and mouth,
and Lyme's disease?

256
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:35,197
- Ooh.
- Justine.

257
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:37,132
- ( bleating )
- Git, git.

258
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:40,670
<i>- Morning.
- All right?</i>

259
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:44,474
It's okay, love. Their baas
are worse than their bite.

260
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:46,375
( chuckling )

261
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:04,360
( whimpers )

262
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:08,263
<i>( car approaches )</i>

263
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,766
<i>( door closes )</i>

264
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,304
Molly:
Thank you, darling.

265
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:18,440
<i>I had a wonderful time.</i>

266
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,510
Did ya, duchess?

267
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:22,512
And thank you
for the tips.

268
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:36,792
Archie and Justine

269
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,828
Didn't sleep together
last night.

270
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:40,930
He slept there.

271
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:43,699
I'm sure that's nobody's
business but theirs, Lexie.

272
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,834
Really?

273
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:48,337
Come to take him back
to London, you know?

274
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:49,839
And we can't
have that.

275
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,041
He's our Archie,
isn't he?

276
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:56,746
This is very good of you. I really
think we ought to pay you something.

277
00:14:56,747 --> 00:14:58,280
I wouldn't hear of it.

278
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:00,215
Destroy your political cred, would it?

279
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:02,752
Doing Laird's accounts as
well as taking his money?

280
00:15:02,753 --> 00:15:04,386
You could do
a lot more with it

281
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:05,588
Than spend it on me,
you know?

282
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:07,089
I might,
if I had any.

283
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,692
Someone like yourself with energy
and a sense of responsibility-

284
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:11,594
A radical Laird.

285
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:13,295
There's so much
to be done here

286
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:14,363
For the community.

287
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:17,399
People like you and me
should work together.

288
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,068
( floor creaks )

289
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:20,202
Justine.

290
00:15:20,203 --> 00:15:21,470
You feeling better?

291
00:15:21,471 --> 00:15:23,573
Marginally.

292
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:25,174
Hello, again.

293
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:30,980
How 'bout some tea?

294
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,690
Where are they?

295
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:41,958
In the library.

296
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:43,693
You know,
where I come from,

297
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:46,095
Only drug dealers drive
foxy vehicles like that.

298
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:53,435
Oh, well. Can't stand
around gossiping all day.

299
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:54,971
I'm in a pickle
in a stew.

300
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:57,907
I'm here to throw myself
on your charity and generosity.

301
00:15:57,908 --> 00:16:00,175
You are jesting.
You're as rich as Croesus.

302
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:02,011
Whatever's the matter,
Kilwillie?

303
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:06,148
I've done a deal with these
Fujiyama car people,

304
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:08,383
For them to take over my place
for three days,

305
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,452
So they can show
their latest model to the press.

306
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:13,789
I've got 50 journalists
coming to get wined and dined

307
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,291
<i>And play "Damon Hill"
on the mountain roads.</i>

308
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:18,227
What a great way
to diversify income.

309
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,262
<i>Molly: So?</i>

310
00:16:20,263 --> 00:16:22,364
They were due to come
the day after tomorrow.

311
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:25,567
But they've just rung up today and
said now they want to come tomorrow-

312
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,603
Put on a special dinner
in the evening.

313
00:16:27,604 --> 00:16:30,806
- But tomorrow night's the ball.
- I know.

314
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:32,541
It's obvious
what you must do, Kilwillie.

315
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:34,677
Tell them to take a running
jump into Yokohama Bay.

316
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:36,912
<i>Kilwillie:
I can't, old man.</i>

317
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,649
They've given me 50 grand
and a brand new motor,

318
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,317
And... I want them
to come back next year.

319
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:43,653
<i>I warned you.</i>

320
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:46,255
This is exactly the kind
of curse you call upon your head

321
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,557
When you sign a compact
with the devil commerce.

322
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:51,460
Be realistic, father. Kilwillie's
doing exactly what he has to.

323
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:54,830
So, when you said you were throwing
yourself on our thingammies...

324
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:57,767
Well,
I was just wondering-

325
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:58,901
Oh, no!

326
00:16:58,902 --> 00:17:01,370
If you could possibly
see your way to-

327
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:03,372
Absolutely
and definitely not!

328
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:06,208
But you always used to have
the ball here until Jamie-

329
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,847
It's too much to ask,
Kilwillie.

330
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:14,383
One day's notice,
the dust.

331
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:16,652
The thing is, we've got
the builders in.

332
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:20,389
Well,
sort of builders.

333
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,224
Oh, dear.

334
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:24,326
<i>Katrina: But you can't cancel the ball.</i>

335
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:27,797
The whole community's
looking forward to it so much.

336
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:30,099
- ( sighs )
- I'm sorry, we're going to have to say no.

337
00:17:32,936 --> 00:17:34,704
Hang on.
I could do it.

338
00:17:36,506 --> 00:17:37,639
What?

339
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,308
With everyone's help.

340
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,577
- Justine.
- Come on.

341
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:43,179
We run a restaurant.

342
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,514
<i>I used to organize
events just like this.</i>

343
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:48,383
It's a piece of cake,
provided you've got leadership.

344
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,152
Oh, I say.

345
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,787
Now listen here...

346
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:53,789
Let's start
with the basics.

347
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:01,263
Okay,

348
00:18:01,264 --> 00:18:04,066
Nice space.

349
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:06,736
The dancing could be
here. There's a band?

350
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:08,437
Kind of secondhand
Jimmy Shand.

351
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:10,005
Band will go there.

352
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,541
Food in the dining room,
bar in the library.

353
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:16,445
- There's outside caterers?

354
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:18,814
Justine: I'll give them
a call in the morning,

355
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:20,916
Sort out the other
details then.

356
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:22,551
If you really think
you can do it.

357
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:24,253
I wash my hands
of the whole business.

358
00:18:24,254 --> 00:18:26,956
She's completely marvelous.

359
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:28,758
Okay, then, why not?

360
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,726
If everyone
pitches in.

361
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:33,362
Maybe Katrina can
help me tomorrow?

362
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,496
Me?

363
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:36,531
For the sake
of the community.

364
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,700
After all, there's
so much to be done here.

365
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,238
People like you and me
should work together.

368
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,583
It's me.

00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:01,456
Me, you daft gowk.

371
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:08,864
Alan.

372
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:18,674
Make yourself at home,
why don't you?

373
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:20,042
Doing my best.

374
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,578
Got any hobnobs?

375
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,015
You really take the
biscuit, you know that?

376
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:27,983
What are
you doing here?

377
00:19:27,984 --> 00:19:29,584
Fact-finding mission.

378
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,653
New policy document
on agriculture,

379
00:19:31,654 --> 00:19:34,389
The plight of crofters
and tenant farmers.

380
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,892
So the party sends
its spin doctor-in-chief

381
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:38,861
And he just happens
to come to my glen.

382
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:41,330
Smells fishy to me.

383
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:44,033
Any chance of a bed
for a weary traveler?

384
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,303
I'll get you a pillow
for the sofa.

00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:21,403
Who were you gallivanting
with this afternoon?

388
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:23,472
Just a friend.

389
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,742
We don't have any friends
who own off-white Rolls Royces.

390
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:28,777
We don't, but I do.

391
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:30,145
Who is he?

392
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:33,282
His name is Geordie.
He's my bookie.

Your what?

394
00:20:35,685 --> 00:20:37,786
My turf accountant.

Good god.

396
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:41,257
What do you
get up to together?

397
00:20:41,258 --> 00:20:42,892
Well, what do you think?

398
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:46,461
You are shameless.
I don't know what to say to you.

399
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:48,297
Tell me I'm a jezebel.

400
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:50,266

I'm going to my room...

407

Perhaps you'd prefer it
if I retrieved your stick?

414
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,385

Just wood.

418
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:57,532
I've decided.

419
00:21:57,533 --> 00:22:00,202
This was a tick.
Cross was down there.

420
00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:09,044
Well, let's
get to work.

421

00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,192
Off to indoctrinate

423
00:22:23,193 --> 00:22:25,794
Ha, you should
have your own show.

424
00:22:25,795 --> 00:22:27,596
Anyway, it's Saturday,

425
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:29,564
You, whose finger's
on the nation's pulse.

Can I buy you
dinner tonight,

427
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:32,801
For old times' sake?

428
00:22:32,802 --> 00:22:34,370
Which old times
would they be?

429
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:36,738
The time I found you in bed
with somebody else?

430
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:39,708
Come on, where did you
sleep last night,

431
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:40,976
The knife drawer?

432
00:22:40,977 --> 00:22:42,577
Life's too short
for this.

433
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:43,712
I'm out tonight.

434
00:22:43,713 --> 00:22:45,280
I do have a social life.

435
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,482
Where are you going?

00:22:46,483 --> 00:22:48,317
If you must know,

437
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:50,785
I'm going to a ball,
at Glenbogle House.

Molly, these

442
00:23:00,997 --> 00:23:02,697
I stopped buying
clothes years ago,

443
00:23:02,698 --> 00:23:03,865
When the money
ran out.

444
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:05,867
I don't even buy
knickers any more.

445
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:07,236
Really? So...?

446
00:23:07,237 --> 00:23:09,138
I just don't
bother wearing them.

00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:12,674
It's wonderful.
I do recommend it.

It's rather
a splendid thing,

450
00:23:14,577 --> 00:23:16,978
Making sensual discoveries
at my time of life.

451
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,381
Oh, this is exquisite.

452
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:21,383
Mind you, I don't
think Hector's noticed.

00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:23,085
Givenchy, 1959.

Of Jamie and Archie
when they were little.

463
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:46,275
So would I.
We have some of Archie,

464
00:23:46,276 --> 00:23:48,610
But the best ones of Jamie
disappeared years ago.

465
00:23:48,611 --> 00:23:50,179
No.

466
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,881

sort of got lost.

Taking them walkies,
you mean.

472
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:14,436
Different pasture every day.
It's not good for them, you know.

473
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:16,037
I'm trying
to fatten them up,

474
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,307
Not put 'em through
a Jane Fonda exercise course.

475
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:20,175
Have you got a problem?

476
00:24:20,176 --> 00:24:21,943
Landlord-type problem.

"I'll supervise it all,"
you said. The old story.

- Come on, come away.

The skirting
by the fireplace was loose.

508
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,920
Someone must have hid it
years back.

509
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:43,525
"J.M."
it must have been Jamie.

510

What is it?

511
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,732
They found this

00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,315
Ah, well...
One summer,

532
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:15,216
Archie was 14,

533
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,986
Jamie 18, about
to go to Oxford,

534
00:27:17,987 --> 00:27:19,488
And they came
out here one day

535
00:27:19,489 --> 00:27:20,989
In Hector's
old dinghy.

536
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:24,926
Calm as a millpond.

537
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:26,828
<i>Then Archie...</i>

538
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,332
<i>Started acting the goat.</i>

539
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:31,800
<i>Leaping up and down
in the prow.</i>

540
00:27:33,503 --> 00:27:35,604
<i>The top and the bottom
was he capsized the thing.</i>

541
00:27:37,707 --> 00:27:39,140
<i>So in they went,</i>

542
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:41,743
<i>Which was not a problem
as they could both...</i>

543
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,378
<i>Swim like fishes.
But...</i>

544
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,981
<i>They had a dog with them,</i>

545
00:27:46,982 --> 00:27:49,618
<i>Hector's old labrador,
and she-</i>

546
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:51,853
<i>She panicked
and went under.</i>

547
00:27:53,489 --> 00:27:56,124
<i>Now Jamie took a mouthful
of air and swam after her,</i>

548
00:27:58,728 --> 00:28:02,096
<i>Just as Archie
was climbing on to the boat.</i>

549
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,499
And...

550
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,535
He never came back up.

551
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,405
Yeah.
The police divers

552
00:28:10,406 --> 00:28:11,940
Found him
six hours later,

553
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:14,175
Caught up in the weeds
by that inlet there.

554
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:16,978
You know something?

555
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:20,515
<i>It was the day
of the Glenbogle Ball.</i>

556
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:23,685
I had to stand out front,

557
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:25,620
Receive all these folk
in their finery-

558
00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:30,024
Explain what had happened
over and over again.

559
00:28:32,395 --> 00:28:33,862
<i>Molly cried for a year.</i>

560
00:28:35,698 --> 00:28:38,199
<i>Hector never shed a tear,
so she said.</i>

561
00:28:40,202 --> 00:28:43,638
<i>As for Archie
and his father, well...</i>

562
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,107
<i>How could things
ever be the same again?</i>

563
00:28:57,286 --> 00:28:58,754
I'm, uh,

564
00:28:58,755 --> 00:29:01,022
Glad we found
these old things.

565
00:29:02,124 --> 00:29:03,759
It's good to have them.

566
00:29:19,475 --> 00:29:21,042
Dear boy.

567
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:24,546
When will I be
free of it, mother?

568
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:29,050
Archie, get on
with your life.

569
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,854
Take your girl
to the ball.

570
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:35,457
Be happy.

571
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,698
Come on, Lewis.

572
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,199
Come on.

573
00:29:52,107 --> 00:29:54,676
Here, boys.
It wasn't your fault.

574
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:56,645
Thanks, ma'am.

575
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:04,519
<i>( chattering workmen )</i>

576
00:30:18,868 --> 00:30:21,069
Archie, I...

577
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,275
Come on, I'll
give you a lift.

578
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,421
What can I say
to you, Archie?

579
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,323
Only that I'm sorry.

580
00:30:42,324 --> 00:30:45,794
My mother says
"Get on with your life, Archie,"

581
00:30:45,795 --> 00:30:48,930
But sometimes... I don't know
what my life is, you know?

582
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:53,835
It's not just you
wondering that.

583
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:56,404
I know.
I'm so privileged, but-

584
00:30:58,207 --> 00:30:59,574
( deep sigh )

585
00:31:01,544 --> 00:31:02,978
Thanks, Katrina.

586
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,885
Listen, I'd better go.
The ball.

587
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:25,033
<i>( car door closes )</i>

588
00:31:25,034 --> 00:31:27,235
<i>( car starts )</i>

589
00:31:46,756 --> 00:31:50,491
So, that's the Laird
of Glenbogle.

590
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,727
<i>The dashing
young dinosaur.</i>

591
00:31:52,728 --> 00:31:54,729
At least he's trying
to evolve.

592
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,431
<i>Unlike some.</i>

593
00:31:58,067 --> 00:31:59,834
<i>( cabinet slams )</i>

594
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,436
( chuckling )

595
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:04,773
<i>( music playing )</i>

596
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,508
Those chaps
all right?

597
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,011
<i>They seem to be murdering
a perfectly good tune.</i>

598
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:14,348
Oh, lovely,
my dear,

599
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,117
<i>You look lovely.</i>

600
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:18,887
Back in a minute.

601
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:21,189
Back in a kilt, I hope?

602
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,324
Mr. And Mrs.
David Muir.

603
00:32:23,325 --> 00:32:25,226
First guests,
get in line.

604
00:32:41,343 --> 00:32:42,944
Oh, my boy.

605
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:44,445
Check him out.

606
00:32:44,446 --> 00:32:46,781
Straight off
a shortbread tin.

607
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:49,918
What are you doing?

608
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,385
Well done.

609
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,489
Almost got rid of the
stench of deer guts.

610
00:33:15,044 --> 00:33:16,978
You're such bricks.

611
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,016
Um, this is,
er, mister-

612
00:33:21,017 --> 00:33:22,951
These are two gentlemen
from Fujiyama.

613
00:33:22,952 --> 00:33:24,519
Ah.

614
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,454
And, er, they're both very
anxious to know

615
00:33:26,455 --> 00:33:29,290
- What a Caledonian ball is really like.
- Ah.

616
00:33:35,164 --> 00:33:37,598
Ooh! Archie!

617
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:48,476
Kilwillie's daughter,
Flora.

618
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:51,445
The two old fellas
always dreamed about it-

619
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,848
Uniting two
ancient bloodlines...

620
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:55,116
With Laurel
and Hardy there.

621
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:00,855
Mr. Geordie McCann.

622
00:34:06,062 --> 00:34:07,929
Ah, you'll be
the husband then?

623
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,798
Allegedly.

624
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,534
Well, duchess,
may I have the pleasure?

625
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,506
Don't worry about me.

626
00:34:18,507 --> 00:34:19,874
I'm only a cripple anyway.

627
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:22,110
Kilwillie, I need
the stiffest drink

628
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:23,544
<i>This side
of the Arctic.</i>

629
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,619
Come on,
Ginger Rogers.

630
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,121
Strut your stuff.

631
00:34:59,081 --> 00:35:01,282
<i>Lewis: Our father
would choke in his grave</i>

632
00:35:01,283 --> 00:35:02,917
If he could see us now...

633
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:05,686
In a house of dissolution.

634
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,655
Among devil's cavortings

635
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:10,091
And godless Sassenachs.

636
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:12,827
Lewis, you're my brother
and my partner,

637
00:35:12,828 --> 00:35:15,864
But you're
a pure blind bigot.

638
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:18,299
Here, give us
another dram.

639
00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:35,083
Hello, lass.

640
00:35:35,084 --> 00:35:36,617
Hi.

641
00:35:36,618 --> 00:35:38,052
You look the part.

642
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,088
I don't feel it.

643
00:35:43,425 --> 00:35:46,261
Miss Katrina Finlay.

644
00:35:50,532 --> 00:35:52,466
Katrina.

645
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:54,235
Everything okay?

646
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:56,470
What a sweet
little dress.

647
00:35:56,471 --> 00:35:58,173
Does wonders for you.

648
00:35:58,174 --> 00:36:01,209
Just goes to show what
a bit of color will do.

649
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,743
Thank you, Justine.

650
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,245
I suppose you'd
know all about that

651
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,847
With your complexion.

652
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:14,355
Right, boys.

653
00:36:14,356 --> 00:36:16,224
Ready for a spot
of direct action?

654
00:36:16,225 --> 00:36:18,226
What, like chinning
the little git?

655
00:36:18,227 --> 00:36:20,161
That's too easy.

656
00:36:20,162 --> 00:36:22,463
The way to get at folk,
like this Kilwillie,

657
00:36:22,464 --> 00:36:25,133
Is to embarrass him in front
of his social peers.

658
00:36:27,536 --> 00:36:30,705
So, I see...
You brought the, er-

659
00:36:30,706 --> 00:36:34,375
<i>( sheep bleating,
blends into bagpipes)</i>

660
00:36:49,091 --> 00:36:50,725
<i>( bagpipes softer )</i>

661
00:36:50,726 --> 00:36:53,761
<i>Macsween: Can you not
hear other pipes? Far away?</i>

662
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:04,272
Like the ghosts
of a battle...

663
00:37:04,273 --> 00:37:06,975
Fought and lost,
long ago.

664
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,114
Ah, you've
no poetry in you.

665
00:37:13,115 --> 00:37:14,949
Lachie,

666
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:18,052
You're my brother
and my partner,

667
00:37:18,053 --> 00:37:20,521
But I hate your guts.

668
00:37:20,522 --> 00:37:22,190
<i>( bagpipes stop )</i>

669
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:43,912
Ahh.

670
00:37:52,421 --> 00:37:54,188
Oh, hello.

671
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,060
Could I have one of those?

672
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:04,598
You disapprove
of women drinking whisky?

673
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:06,667
Only if they
don't really like it

674
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:08,702
And are just
trying to make a point.

675
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,604
Then it's a sad waste.

676
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:20,714
Ah, not apparently
on this occasion.

677
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:25,320
You disapprove of me though,
don't you, Hector?

678
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:27,288
<i>Just for the record-</i>

679
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:29,057
I approve of you.

680
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:30,925
You say what you think.

681
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,964
And... I'm sorry
about Jamie.

682
00:38:37,632 --> 00:38:39,767
Why should you be sorry?
You never knew him.

683
00:38:39,768 --> 00:38:42,437
No, but...

684
00:38:42,438 --> 00:38:44,905
His death still hurts
someone I care about,

685
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,507
So I'm sorry.

686
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:52,480
And, I understand a little.

687
00:38:53,882 --> 00:38:55,749
I once lost a child.

688
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,885
A miscarriage.

689
00:38:57,886 --> 00:38:59,687
Years ago.

690
00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:02,923
Even Archie doesn't know.

691
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,095
The world is never
the same again, is it?

692
00:39:08,897 --> 00:39:10,264
No.

693
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:15,569
So... You want to marry
my son, do you?

694
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,407
I don't give a damn
about marrying him.

695
00:39:19,408 --> 00:39:21,275
I'd like to go on
living with him.

696
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,444
I'd like to have
children with him.

697
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:25,313
Would you now?

698
00:39:25,314 --> 00:39:27,048
If that's what he wants.

699
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:29,717
I'm not sure that he does.

700
00:39:29,718 --> 00:39:31,219
Ah.

701
00:39:33,155 --> 00:39:35,023
Justine, you know,

702
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:37,325
You're not actually
such a bad chap.

703
00:39:37,326 --> 00:39:39,727
<i>( door opens )</i>

704
00:39:39,728 --> 00:39:40,961
There you are, child.

705
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,296
Will you...

706
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,864
Come and have
a canter with me?

707
00:39:52,074 --> 00:39:53,341

A dinosaur about
to become extinct.

711
00:40:16,465 --> 00:40:17,765
Oh, there you are.

712
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:19,300
<i>Hector: Aye.</i>

713
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:20,935
<i>If you're looking
for Justine,</i>

714
00:40:20,936 --> 00:40:22,903
She's having her feet
flattened by Kilwillie.

715
00:40:22,904 --> 00:40:24,505
I know.

716
00:40:25,574 --> 00:40:27,108
Everything all right
between you two?

717
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:29,177
I don't know.

718
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:30,744
Hmm.

719
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:33,081
Your mother still dancing
with that bookie fella?

720
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:34,482
Yes.

721
00:40:34,483 --> 00:40:37,118
Everything all right
between you two?

722
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,852
I don't know.

723
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,721
Have a drink.

724
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:44,625
Women, eh?

725
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:47,295
Indeed.

726
00:40:47,296 --> 00:40:49,330
Well, I'm glad
we agree about something.

727
00:41:12,421 --> 00:41:13,654
Where have
you been?

728
00:41:13,655 --> 00:41:14,922
Come on.

729
00:41:14,923 --> 00:41:17,458
No, Flora, I can't.
Thank you.

730
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:18,792
Are you
all right?

731
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:24,198
They seem to be
playing our song.

732
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,633
Thursday afternoons.

733
00:41:25,634 --> 00:41:27,201
Miss MacPherson.

734
00:41:27,202 --> 00:41:29,604
Smelly socks
and overcooked cabbage.

735
00:41:29,605 --> 00:41:31,739
I used to hate
that lesson.

736
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,308
Scottish
country dancing.

737
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:36,110
You never had
the right partner.

738
00:41:36,111 --> 00:41:38,246
Maureen MacLeod
always nabbed you.

739
00:41:52,694 --> 00:41:54,629
It's a fine ball,
old man.

740
00:41:55,964 --> 00:41:57,298
Are you all right?

741
00:41:57,299 --> 00:41:59,634
Every man has his
breaking point, Kilwillie.

742
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,248
Right.

743
00:42:48,584 --> 00:42:50,218
You want plumbing?

744
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:52,687
You'll get
bloody plumbing.

745
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:04,532
The windows of heaven
were opened...

746
00:43:06,034 --> 00:43:08,603
And there was rain
upon the earth.

747
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:23,150
Katrina: Thanks for that, Archie.

748
00:43:24,653 --> 00:43:26,320
In the olden days
chiefs like Archie

749
00:43:26,321 --> 00:43:28,422
Could do what they want
with their kinsmen's women.

750
00:43:28,423 --> 00:43:31,091
<i>Sowed more seeds
than a Massey Ferguson.</i>

751
00:43:31,092 --> 00:43:33,227
No wonder we kept
losing to the English.

752
00:43:34,396 --> 00:43:36,597
Ooh, Duncan!
Ha, ha.

753
00:43:36,598 --> 00:43:37,931
So who is
this Alan chap?

754
00:43:37,932 --> 00:43:40,468
Katrina, perhaps you'd like
to take a look at the buffet,

755
00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:42,536
Make sure they don't
run out of chicken legs?

756
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:45,706
Justine, I think maybe you're the
expert in the chicken legs department.

757
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:47,742
Now, come on, girls,
let's just be friends.

758
00:43:47,743 --> 00:43:49,577
- Keep out of this!
- Shut up!

759
00:43:49,578 --> 00:43:51,945
Wonderful. Now I must
go and find Hector.

760
00:43:51,946 --> 00:43:54,448
I thought your first duty
was to your guests?

761
00:43:54,449 --> 00:43:56,517
You're a lovely man,
Geordie,

762
00:43:56,518 --> 00:43:58,118
An even lovelier bookie.

763
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:00,854
But Hector, you see,
he's my husband.

764
00:44:00,855 --> 00:44:02,456
Ach, you're
wasted on him.

765
00:44:02,457 --> 00:44:04,492
Unhand my wife, sir!

766
00:44:04,493 --> 00:44:05,693
Hector,
don't be so stupid.

767
00:44:05,694 --> 00:44:07,561
I demand you stop
this malarkey right now.

768
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,330
Don't be daft,
old timer.

769
00:44:09,331 --> 00:44:11,198
You, sir, are
an appalling little oik!

770
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:12,199
<i>Hector!</i>

771
00:44:22,544 --> 00:44:24,111
Father.

772
00:44:24,112 --> 00:44:25,413
<i>( sheep bleating )</i>

773
00:44:25,414 --> 00:44:26,614
<i>( screaming )</i>

774
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:30,751
Ooh!

775
00:44:48,704 --> 00:44:50,304
Lord Kilwillie,

776
00:44:50,305 --> 00:44:52,172
While you're here
enjoying yourself,

777
00:44:52,173 --> 00:44:56,310
Your tenants and their
stock are suffering.

778
00:44:56,311 --> 00:44:58,011
You're a parasite
and a leech,

779
00:44:58,012 --> 00:45:00,080
And decent folk
want you out.

780
00:45:00,081 --> 00:45:01,716
- Out, out
- out, out.

781
00:45:01,717 --> 00:45:04,184
Just get out!
Get out!

782
00:45:04,185 --> 00:45:05,953
Baa.

783
00:45:08,523 --> 00:45:09,757
<i>( screaming )</i>

784
00:45:13,395 --> 00:45:15,363
No, right, come on,
over here.

785
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:21,134
Whoa... Lexie!

786
00:45:23,572 --> 00:45:25,005
( sarcastically )
ha, ha.

787
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,210
Wild party, old man.

788
00:45:35,784 --> 00:45:36,884
Katrina...

789
00:45:39,187 --> 00:45:40,454
Katrina...

790
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,791
Katrina, come on.

791
00:45:53,034 --> 00:45:56,236
Good night, Justine. I hope you
enjoyed our little entertainment.

792
00:45:56,237 --> 00:45:57,838
<i>Hector:
Good night, Jamie.</i>

793
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,343
Father,

794
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,012
I'm not Jamie.

795
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:06,980
I never was.

796
00:46:06,981 --> 00:46:08,749
I never will be.

797
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:10,918
I'm me.
My name is Archie, okay?

798
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,355
Your... rebuke...
is merited.

799
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,458
I apologize to you.

800
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,494
I'll say good night.

801
00:46:20,495 --> 00:46:22,630
Sleep well, Justine.

802
00:46:34,543 --> 00:46:37,478
I'm leaving in the morning.
Are you coming?

803
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,348
Justine, I can't.
You know I can't.

804
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:43,651
The building work,
the house, everything.

805
00:46:43,652 --> 00:46:46,253
It's not that.
You know, I know.

806
00:46:46,254 --> 00:46:48,622
There are things
to be settled.

807
00:46:48,623 --> 00:46:50,991
But they're all in here.

808
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:54,328
I'm right, aren't I?

809
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:56,997
Okay.

810
00:46:56,998 --> 00:46:58,766
So, I'll wait for you.

811
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:02,369
- Thanks.
- But not forever.

812
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,838
I love you, Archie,

813
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,639
But I won't wait forever.

814
00:47:06,775 --> 00:47:09,643
And stay away from Katrina
or I'll kill you.

815
00:47:17,652 --> 00:47:20,220
<i>Hector: I don't want you to
see that bookie fella again,</i>

816
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:22,490
- Do you hear me?
- Don't be absurd, Hector.

817
00:47:22,491 --> 00:47:24,658
- He's my friend.
- I forbid it.

818
00:47:24,659 --> 00:47:26,527
Well, I shall just
have to defy you then.

819
00:47:26,528 --> 00:47:27,862
Oh, Molly.

820
00:47:27,863 --> 00:47:29,763
After all we've
been through together.

821
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,231
I care for you!

822
00:47:31,232 --> 00:47:33,701
You care more for your
terriers than you do for me.

823
00:47:33,702 --> 00:47:35,736
I need you.
I love you.

824
00:47:35,737 --> 00:47:37,938
Well, if you do,

825
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:41,041
Perhaps the lesson of tonight's
horribly embarrassing,

826
00:47:41,042 --> 00:47:43,911
But in its way,
rather wonderful scene,

827
00:47:43,912 --> 00:47:46,313
Is that you need to show it
rather more.

828
00:47:46,314 --> 00:47:47,982
<i>I'll say good night.</i>

829
00:47:47,983 --> 00:47:49,817
Won't you stay a little?

830
00:47:49,818 --> 00:47:52,386
You looked so wonderful
in that frock tonight.

831
00:47:52,387 --> 00:47:53,654
Is it new?

832
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:58,458
It was...
A quarter of a century ago.
