1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:02,701
<i>Stella: How many rooms do you have here?</i>

2
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:05,837
<i>- Archie: 67. - Stella: 67 rooms
to heat, light and maintain?</i>

3
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:08,539
<i>- no wonder you're broke.
- Archie: never needed to.</i>

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,269
Believe me, we've already
cut overheads to the bone.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,104
If you can find one
example of inefficiency,

6
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:15,806
I'll be the first
to swing the hatchet.

7
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,408
<i>- Hector: fore!
- ( marching music playing )</i>

8
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:25,449
Ah, morning.

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,350
<i>Driving through
the french windows</i>

10
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:29,186
does wonders
for one's accuracy.

11
00:00:29,187 --> 00:00:31,722
Providing you remember
to open them, of course.

12
00:00:31,723 --> 00:00:33,757
Fore!

13
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:37,695
<i>Stella: How do you get the balls back?</i>

14
00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:41,164
I've tried training the dogs but
they're hopeless at holding their breath.

15
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:44,768
A nice chap from paisley sends
me a fresh supply every week.

16
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:46,236
<i>Fore!</i>

17
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:51,508
<i>( classical music playing )</i>

18
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,183
So this is
your studio?

19
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:03,120
Hardly. Just a wee
place where I can dabble.

20
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:05,555
It's so wonderfully
bright-

21
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:07,424
and warm.

22
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:08,926
Don't you find
the view inspiring?

23
00:01:08,927 --> 00:01:12,963
Yes, I'm getting this lovely,
vivid picture in my mind.

24
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:19,536
I think it's time
for that hatchet.

25
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:23,206
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

26
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:01,011
So, how do you budget
the food exactly?

27
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:03,047
We worked
a set routine out.

28
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:05,182
A big breakfast,
a light lunch,

29
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:07,317
and no more than eight
courses at dinnertime.

30
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,554
Eight courses?

31
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:12,522
Seven.

32
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:15,192
That's if they're
feeling informal.

33
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:20,397
We do use a lot
of our own produce.

34
00:02:20,398 --> 00:02:24,534
Aye, we grow our own veg
and catch our own fish.

35
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:26,636
Vintage burgundy,
two cases?

36
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:28,572
Pity you don't
tread your own grapes.

37
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:31,875
<i>- Biscuits from Harrod's.
- Archie: a few luxuries don't hurt.</i>

38
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:33,911
Half a hundred-weight
a week?

39
00:02:33,912 --> 00:02:35,913
Actually,
they're for the dogs.

40
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:38,315
They are working animals.
They do earn their keep.

41
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:39,683
How exactly?

42
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:44,521
Well, they hunt.

43
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:46,389
( barking )

44
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:48,992
Oh, yes.

45
00:02:50,328 --> 00:02:53,263
They've hunted down
my filofax.

46
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:56,867
You must be
so proud.

47
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,072
Stella will giving
her pep talk shortly.

48
00:03:02,073 --> 00:03:05,142
I don't think she was too
impressed by my bookkeeping.

49
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,010
I'm the laird.
I'll take the rap.

50
00:03:07,011 --> 00:03:09,213
<i>It won't
be so bad...</i>

51
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:11,882
though she might make father
dive for his golf balls.

52
00:03:11,883 --> 00:03:13,583
I'd pay good money
to see that.

53
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:15,986
There you are. We're in profit already.

54
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:22,525
Who painted this?

55
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:25,328
Oh, just some
nine-year-old delinquent.

56
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:29,666
"Alexandra. " Oh, that
nine-year-old delinquent.

57
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,334
I thought it was
a picture of Glenbogle.

58
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:33,804
It is- sort of.

59
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:38,275
Used to dream about being a
princess and living in a big castle.

60
00:03:38,276 --> 00:03:40,510
I suppose
I'm halfway there.

61
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,780
You'll always
be my princess, Lexie.

62
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:46,349
Cinderella,
you mean.

63
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,587
So who's Katrina-
the ugly sister?

64
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:52,689
Let's not keep
Stella waiting.

65
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:55,926
His mistress' voice.

66
00:03:57,896 --> 00:03:59,263
( loud clattering )

67
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:01,865
<i>- Archie: Stella-
- this stupid thing is jammed.</i>

68
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,601
These chairs are held
together with cobwebs.

69
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:06,336
( gasps )

70
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:08,272
Is this what they mean
by hands-on management?

71
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,046
Estate income
over the last 12 months,

72
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,481
�42,000.

73
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:24,521
Expenditure over
the same period,

74
00:04:24,522 --> 00:04:29,193
�137,000.

75
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:32,462
Anyone here good at math?
No, I thought not.

76
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:36,867
Here we have outgoings
broken down by percentage.

77
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:40,337
This big cheese
is heating.

78
00:04:40,338 --> 00:04:43,640
<i>This big cheese
is catering.</i>

79
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:45,175
<i>And this one,
oh yes,</i>

80
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:47,344
biscuits
from Harrod's.

81
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:49,746
Cheese and biscuits?
What is she talking about?

82
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,615
This is the projection
from the next quarter.

83
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:55,719
Note the income-
zero.

84
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,025
It'll take three months
to rebuild the bridge.

85
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:05,528
<i>During that time, Glenbogle
will be run on a shoestring.</i>

86
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:07,331
<i>These are my proposals.</i>

87
00:05:07,332 --> 00:05:10,767
<i>First, nonessential rooms
will be closed off.</i>

88
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,204
<i>Most households in this country
get by with two living rooms.</i>

89
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:16,907
Now it's your turn.
Second,

90
00:05:16,908 --> 00:05:20,577
strict control of outlay
on groceries and petrol.

91
00:05:20,578 --> 00:05:24,848
Anything that needs to be
bought, I sign the check.

92
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:27,751
Third, the dogs
have to go.

93
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:29,253
Go? go where?

94
00:05:29,254 --> 00:05:33,023
When you say proposals,
these are open for discussion?

95
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:35,859
Did I say proposals?
I meant decisions.

96
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,763
<i>Staff pay and conditions
will be reviewed separately.</i>

97
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:42,132
Any questions?

98
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:50,573
You're not seriously suggesting
we get rid of the dogs?

99
00:05:50,574 --> 00:05:53,676
Well, they're a drain on
resources. They live here rent-free

100
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:55,979
and consume their own
weight in food every week.

101
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,116
So do golly, Lexie, and Duncan.
we're not getting rid of them.

102
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:02,652
Actually, I was
coming to that.

103
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,854
I know how fond you are of the staff

104
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:06,489
and how loyal
they've been,

105
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,892
- but...
- but what?

106
00:06:08,893 --> 00:06:11,128
I have to explain to
my bank why we're paying

107
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,430
for your family to be
waited on hand and foot.

108
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:16,666
- You think that's all the staff do?
- It doesn't matter.

109
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,535
We can't afford
to have them do it.

110
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:20,870
- We'll have to let them go.
- No way.

111
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:24,607
- We'll keep their jobs open until the bridge
is repaired. - Forget it. Absolutely not.

112
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:26,576
You said you'd help
manage this place.

113
00:06:26,577 --> 00:06:29,079
I will, as long as it doesn't
involve sacking the workforce.

114
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,915
Archie, either they go
or Glenbogle does.

115
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,517
I'm sorry. I wish there was another way.

116
00:06:34,518 --> 00:06:37,387
Hold on.

117
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:40,690
Just wait a minute.

118
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,793
- She wanted to fire us? - I told her
to forget it. It's not going to happen.

119
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:46,696
- Good on you, Arch.
- So what did she say?

120
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,199
Well, this
was the clever bit.

121
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,602
I had to seize the initiative,
come back with a counterproposal.

122
00:06:52,603 --> 00:06:55,105
Go on.

123
00:06:55,106 --> 00:06:59,242
Nobody gets fired. What we do
is adjust the salary levels,

124
00:06:59,243 --> 00:07:01,345
on a temporary basis
over three months.

125
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:04,247
Ah, right.
Sounds good.

126
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:06,583
He means
a pay cut, Duncan.

127
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:08,751
<i>- it sounds like
that, but- - how much?</i>

128
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:11,855
Taking into account
cash flow and overhead-

129
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:14,024
how much, Archie?

130
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:16,393
50%.

131
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:21,365
Did I miss
the "clever" bit?

132
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:26,136
50%? you're not bothered
by wee things like minimum wage?

133
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:28,705
Well, no, accommodation
would count towards that.

134
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:31,174
You'd only be paying
for food and bills.

135
00:07:31,175 --> 00:07:34,744
- You're charging us for food?
- Only till Glenbogle reopens.

136
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,180
Stella has to sell
something to the bank.

137
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:39,483
- So you're selling us?
- It's not like that.

138
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:42,419
What happened to "I'm the
laird, I'll take the rap"?

139
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,588
We stood by you, when
Stella was going to dump you.

140
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:48,958
- This is how you repay us?
- We're all in this together.

141
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,329
Are we? so why not ask us
how the estate can save money?

142
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,598
- Or does what we have to say not
count? - Of course it does, but-

143
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,068
but not as much
as what's-her-name says.

144
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:00,904
For pete's sake.

145
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:03,440
Well, you can shove
your pay cut.

146
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,675
Lexie, it's either that
or we fire everyone.

147
00:08:05,676 --> 00:08:08,445
"We"? who's side
are you on, Arch?

148
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:14,884
Fine. until you've made up
your mind, I'm out of here.

149
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:16,920
- Lexie...
- I'm on strike.

150
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:19,056
<i>And you can sell that
to the bank.</i>

151
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,361
Talk to her,
will you, golly?

152
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:28,031
Seems to me
she said it all, son.

153
00:08:35,273 --> 00:08:37,240
Duncan?

154
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,654
That went well.

155
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:54,958
Never mind. it's part
of the learning curve.

156
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,826
This way we won't have
to pay them at all.

157
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,595
You knew this would
happen, didn't you?

158
00:08:58,596 --> 00:09:00,263
I anticipated it,
yeah.

159
00:09:00,264 --> 00:09:02,466
Well, maybe you've anticipated
how we can run this place

160
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:04,367
with no housekeeper
and no grounds staff.

161
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:07,937
It's called multi-skilling. Management
steps in and keeps the show going.

162
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:10,673
<i>- Management, meaning you and me?
- Meaning you.</i>

163
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:12,809
I'm going to be negotiating
with the workforce.

164
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,444
They're not going to listen
to you anymore, are they?

165
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:17,780
- If you want my advice-
- thanks, Arch,

166
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:19,682
but I've taken on some pretty
heavy unions in my time.

167
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:22,285
I think I can manage
two yokels and a cook.

168
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,657
( motor sputters )

169
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,695
( swearing )

170
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:35,432
Economy drive, eh?

171
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:37,601
My late wife
was fond of those.

172
00:09:37,602 --> 00:09:40,537
She once sold all my cigars and
canceled my club memberships.

173
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,206
Turned out she was spending
the lot on her tango instructor.

174
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,643
I really am grateful,
Kilwillie.

175
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:48,845
Nonsense.
The pleasure's all mine.

176
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:52,015
Could always use good
dogs. Come on, chaps.

177
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:55,485
Don't suppose you've got any
other assets going spare, have you?

178
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:57,621
I'm short of a good chef
just at the moment.

179
00:09:57,622 --> 00:09:59,556
- No, sorry.
- No, course not.

180
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:06,095
Don't worry, they'll be
feted like kings. promise.

181
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:28,084
What on earth? Have the
clocks gone back or something?

182
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,421
- Good morning. What can I get you?
- Breakfast would be a start.

183
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,956
Lexie's not ill,
is she?

184
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:36,926
Help yourself
to cereal.

185
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,096
It's a variety pack.

186
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,232
I know that.
What do I do with it?

187
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:45,535
I could cook something,
providing I have the ingredients.

188
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:47,837
- Porridge, please. Plenty of salt.
- Porridge. right.

189
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:50,773
Eggs, bacon, sausage,
black pudding and fried bread.

190
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:53,510
Just some fruit salad
for me, dear.

191
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:56,145
What are you up to?
Where is Lexie?

192
00:10:56,146 --> 00:10:58,481
Lexie's on strike.

193
00:10:58,482 --> 00:11:01,384
Strike?
Good grief.

194
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:03,486
The red menace
reaches Glenbogle.

195
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:05,422
Just give me
20 minutes, all right?

196
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:08,625
Never mind. Forget it. I'm
going for a walk. Monty! Rommel!

197
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,727
They've gone.

198
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:13,863
The dogs, they've gone. I've
already taken them to Kilwillie's.

199
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:16,966
- I see. - I should
have let you say goodbye-

200
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,436
goodbye? my dear boy,
Monty and Rommel

201
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:22,171
had many talents, but
conversation wasn't one of them.

202
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:25,942
- I'm sorry.
- For heaven sake, they're only dogs.

203
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:29,112
I think I can find my
way around my own grounds.

204
00:11:30,748 --> 00:11:32,915
I think I'll make
myself something.

205
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,851
Right.

206
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:28,371
That was magnificent,
Lexie.

207
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,474
Should've gotten myself
a housekeeper years ago.

208
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:34,877
Should have moved in with me.
I've got a better cd collection.

209
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,615
I feel safer
with golly somehow.

210
00:12:38,616 --> 00:12:40,950
Where are you going?

211
00:12:40,951 --> 00:12:43,486
To feed
the pheasants

212
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:46,356
<i>and take some
fodder...</i>

213
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:48,157
up to the deer-
except I'm on strike.

214
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:55,231
You could just, like,
pretend it's a day off.

215
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,334
I've never had
a day off in my life.

216
00:12:57,335 --> 00:13:00,203
Don't worry. It's not like
we're going to sit around

217
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:02,939
watching TV all day-
Duncan!

218
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,875
Right. we have
to get organized.

219
00:13:05,876 --> 00:13:09,212
We need to arrange publicity
and set up picket lines,

220
00:13:09,213 --> 00:13:12,248
<i>list our demands.</i>

221
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,685
Right. so...
what are our demands?

222
00:13:19,223 --> 00:13:21,391
- ( classical music plays )
- Blast.

223
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:22,759
Look,
old darling,

224
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,927
would you mind awfully
if we changed the music?

225
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:28,064
- Sorry, what?
- I can't concentrate on my swing

226
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:30,333
with this flowery
nonsense on the gramophone.

227
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:32,869
It's not flowery nonsense. It's Shubert.

228
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,872
Yes, lovely, darling.
But I thought we might...

229
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:38,341
<i>try this
for a change.</i>

230
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:40,109
( loud march music )

231
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,918
( squeaking )

232
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:57,660
( screams )

233
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:04,834
Bad idea. I'm all
you've got at the moment.

234
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:09,305
Archie,
tell me something.

235
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,474
You planning
a pre-emptive strike?

236
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,611
Who owns these tracks leading
into Kilwillie's estate?

237
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:17,414
- We do, of course.
- Who uses them?

238
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:20,884
Kilwillie's forestry people. Otherwise,
he'd have to airlift his timber.

239
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:22,719
How much
do we charge him?

240
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,954
He's a neighbor,
a friend.

241
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:28,090
I'm not going to ask him to
pay for access to his own land.

242
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:30,092
( sighs )
No...

243
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:32,662
I noticed some dodgy
guttering just outside.

244
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,763
What?

245
00:14:33,764 --> 00:14:35,698
Guttering, Archie.
A stitch in time...?

246
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:52,315
<i>Duncan:
Rights for workers!</i>

247
00:14:52,316 --> 00:14:53,850
No compulsory
pay cuts!

248
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,218
Duncan, I am one
of the workers.

249
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:57,720
No, you're not.

250
00:14:57,721 --> 00:15:00,990
You're a scab.
You're a back leg.

251
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:03,793
<i>Black leg.</i>

252
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:06,262
Aye- that and all.

253
00:15:06,263 --> 00:15:08,531
I'm just fixing this
guttering, that's all.

254
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,600
Well, you shouldn't.

255
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:12,902
And you should be using
weatherproof mastic,

256
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:15,371
<i>not the bathroom stuff.</i>

257
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,608
- Do you want to do this?
- Rights for workers.

258
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:23,746
A fair day's pay
for a fair day's... work.

259
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:25,682
I can't hear you.
Sorry.

260
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:27,951
Scab.

261
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:32,822
Scab.

262
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:35,758
Scab! scab! scab!

263
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,827
Do you want to put your foot
on the bottom rung, please?

264
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,898
Thanks.
Carry on.

265
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,536
Archie out! Archie out!
Archie, Archie, Archie!

266
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:49,438
Duncan.
So you're back?

267
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:53,175
No, I'm not.
This is an official picket.

268
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:55,745
I still haven't
heard your demands.

269
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,415
Perhaps you'd like to present
them over a cup of tea.

270
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,551
You can bring
your banner.

271
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:12,595
Don't mind me.
I'll just carry on.

272
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:23,773
Hector!

273
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,743
Sorry, I'm afraid
you're in the way.

274
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:28,978
Why do you have to be
in here at all?

275
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:30,980
<i>Why do you have
to be in here?</i>

276
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:34,918
It's warm and you know that
the heating is off upstairs.

277
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,620
I can't paint
with frozen fingers.

278
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,956
Hypothermia's not exactly
going to improve my golf.

279
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,960
Couldn't make it worse. Why do
we have to listen to that racket?

280
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,462
Racket? that is
John Phillip Sousa.

281
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,599
It sounds like a herd of elephants
rampaging through a steel mill.

282
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,801
Let's just hear
the last side.

283
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,803
No, Hector.
Sorry, no.

284
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,772
- Don't, don't-
- ( record scratches )

285
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:01,110
You scratched it.

286
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:04,513
Really? what a tragic loss
to the world of music.

287
00:17:14,592 --> 00:17:16,525
( record skips )

288
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:26,268
Biscuit?

289
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:33,843
Oops, sorry.
Crumbs.

290
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,714
So, you're saying you'd like
your old jobs back.

291
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:41,985
Aye. and proper
wages, too.

292
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:45,888
<i>I'd love to help, Duncan,</i>

293
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:47,924
but we can't afford it.

294
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:49,325
Oh.

295
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:51,661
But if you return
to work now,

296
00:17:51,662 --> 00:17:54,296
it will stand you
in good stead for the future.

297
00:17:54,297 --> 00:17:56,599
- Hm?
- When we reopen...

298
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,367
there will be
positions available

299
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,770
for a field
sports manager

300
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:03,940
and a domestic
supervisor

301
00:18:03,941 --> 00:18:06,475
and a head ranger.

302
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:10,412
A head ranger?

303
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:35,437
This radiator hasn't been off
for years. You must have upset it.

304
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:37,306
What do you suggest?
Counseling?

305
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:39,575
Lexie's the only person who
knows how to keep it working.

306
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,078
Well, you had better learn, quick.

307
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,747
Certainly. just pass me
that instruction manual

308
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:48,484
- I'll get right on to it.
- What manual- fine.

309
00:18:48,485 --> 00:18:50,586
So it's a job
for the yellow pages.

310
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,589
Been there, done it. The call
out charge to Glenbogle is �300.

311
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,225
All we have to do is ask
Lexie to have a look at it.

312
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:59,762
No, all we have to do
is keep our coats on.

313
00:19:05,836 --> 00:19:08,237
The clothes go in here,
the soap goes in here-

314
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:10,573
I've tried
being reasonable,

315
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:12,541
but I might
as well speak...

316
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,811
I know, mother. In order
to organize the wash-

317
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:18,447
I need a little private space
to pursue my own interests.

318
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,083
The programs
are listed here.

319
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:22,651
I'm not married to a human,
I'm married to a set of clubs.

320
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:25,888
I can't do everything. I need
to show you how this works.

321
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:29,491
Archie, darling...
if I run out of smalls,

322
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:31,427
I'll get on the phone
and order some more.

323
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:33,162
Now you must
excuse me.

324
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:35,598
Your father is wreaking
havoc in my studio.

325
00:19:40,204 --> 00:19:43,572
Ahem
- is this your picket to the main gate?

326
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:45,775
There's not much point
while the bridge is down.

327
00:19:45,776 --> 00:19:48,144
The point is to try
and win some solidarity,

328
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,446
let the outside world
know what's going on.

329
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:53,049
I thought it was your job. Where's
the "mass strength of the media"

330
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,784
with your
television helicopters?

331
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:56,953
What we need
is an angle.

332
00:19:56,954 --> 00:19:59,989
Something the public
can get worked up about.

333
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,891
What are you doing
up here, anyway?

334
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:03,960
Pheasants haven't been
fed since yesterday.

335
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:06,829
That's it-

336
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,865
callous management
lays off workers

337
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:11,067
while the livestock starve.
It's perfect.

338
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:14,871
<i>- Look.
- Archie, you creep.</i>

339
00:20:14,872 --> 00:20:16,839
I knew he wouldn't let
the beasts go hungry.

340
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,408
But it's all right for
us to starve, is that it?

341
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:21,510
You're taking this
awful personal, Lexie.

342
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,445
<i>It is personal.</i>

343
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:26,082
He's supposed to stand up for
us, not lay down for Stella.

344
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,317
I could do with
some help down here.

345
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:30,153
Come on.

346
00:20:31,655 --> 00:20:33,489
Come on.

347
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,516
What do you mean you're
not going to picket?

348
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:03,585
It might jeopardize
my prospects.

349
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:06,655
Stella says that when Glenbogle
reopens I could be head ranger.

350
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:09,959
What else did she offer you?
A wee hat with a badge on it?

351
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,129
<i>- a whistle-?
- It's just-</i>

352
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,431
I don't know what
we're trying to achieve.

353
00:21:15,432 --> 00:21:19,101
We are trying to achieve
parity with the livestock.

354
00:21:19,102 --> 00:21:21,037
She says we're not even
a proper union.

355
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:22,972
Duncan-

356
00:21:22,973 --> 00:21:25,407
why are you listening
to that conniving cow?

357
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:28,477
I suppose she gave you
the little-girl-lost look.

358
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:30,847
Asked for your advice,
did she?

359
00:21:32,115 --> 00:21:35,484
<i>Duncan,
can't you see?</i>

360
00:21:35,485 --> 00:21:38,120
She's manipulating you.

361
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:40,089
Stick with your friends.

362
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,624
Stick with the people
you can trust.

363
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,561
I'd never treat you
that way.

364
00:21:45,562 --> 00:21:48,597
Oh. crumbs.

365
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,399
Now this
is a microwave.

366
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,969
Can't a chap play a round of
golf in his own living room

367
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,037
without being
branded a war criminal?

368
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:57,740
Remember, no metal.
You simply decant the food,

369
00:21:57,741 --> 00:22:00,009
pop it in here,
close the door-

370
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,777
if a chap
can't practice,

371
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,779
he exposes himself
to ridicule.

372
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,848
These days, all I've
got left is my dignity.

373
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,986
Why don't you
have a go?

374
00:22:09,987 --> 00:22:12,021
What do I do
with this?

375
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:13,822
I thought you were
in the army.

376
00:22:13,823 --> 00:22:16,859
I was. that's why I can
strip down a machine gun

377
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,727
and defuse
a live torpedo.

378
00:22:18,728 --> 00:22:22,164
You don't learn that in the catering
corps. When is Lexie coming back?

379
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:24,166
I don't know.

380
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:28,070
You'll have to stand in for her.
None of that nouvelle cuisine.

381
00:22:28,071 --> 00:22:31,140
- Where are you going?
- To practice my swing.

382
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,709
It's so cold in this house,
I'm going to try outside.

383
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:47,123
Has the heating packed up?
It's freezing in the back house.

384
00:22:47,124 --> 00:22:49,158
I thought it was
kind of bracing.

385
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,594
Not that you would know.
Nice and cozy in here.

386
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:54,931
How's the strike
going, Lexie?

387
00:22:54,932 --> 00:22:57,866
Need any help with pickets or publicity?

388
00:22:57,867 --> 00:23:00,336
Thanks, but we can
manage without you

389
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,138
<i>better than you
can manage without us.</i>

390
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:04,907
Oh, we'll get by, though
Archie's having a hard time of it.

391
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:07,443
Oh, no. is he?

392
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:10,446
For a girl with big bones, you act fast.

393
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:12,982
Dangling the head ranger's
job in front of Duncan,

394
00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:15,584
expecting me to take pity
on the "poor wee laird. "

395
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:17,853
Archie's made
his own bed...

396
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,390
<i>- you can lie in it.
- Funny way to put it.</i>

397
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:25,428
And when you begin to wise up you
can come speak to me, not Duncan.

398
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:27,229
Duncan can think
for himself.

399
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,599
Until you worked
your feminine charms on him.

400
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,935
<i>Well, two can play
at the game, darling.</i>

401
00:23:32,936 --> 00:23:37,006
Archie's not my weakness...
he's yours.

402
00:23:54,157 --> 00:23:56,192
Oh- no soup?

403
00:23:56,193 --> 00:23:58,727
<i>I haven't had time to
prepare soup. I'm sorry.</i>

404
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:02,131
It would help to warm us up. Lexie
always has a big pot on the go.

405
00:24:02,132 --> 00:24:04,433
Well, Lexie
is not here, is she?

406
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:06,668
I'm well aware
of that, darling.

407
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,671
Look at this.
Look at it.

408
00:24:09,672 --> 00:24:11,374
That is sheer unmitigated vandalism.

409
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,643
No, dear, vandalism is when
you punch holes in paintings.

410
00:24:14,644 --> 00:24:16,479
That was an accident,
damn it.

411
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,415
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Take up billiards?

412
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,617
Will you please sit down
and eat your lunch?

413
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:25,388
If you get near my clubs again, I
will not be responsible for my actions.

414
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:27,623
Have you ever been?

415
00:24:27,624 --> 00:24:30,326
What's this?
Where's the soup?

416
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,667
What on earth's
got into the boy?

417
00:24:38,668 --> 00:24:40,569
You're his father.

418
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,140
How dare you? I had nothing
to do with his upbringing.

419
00:24:47,477 --> 00:24:49,111
Lexie.

420
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,747
You look vexed. You want
me to run you a hot bath?

421
00:24:51,748 --> 00:24:54,550
- We've no hot water.
- I could warm it up for you.

422
00:24:54,551 --> 00:24:58,320
Wait a minute.
I'm on strike.

423
00:24:58,321 --> 00:25:01,057
If you've come here to gloat,
you can go somewhere else.

424
00:25:01,058 --> 00:25:04,427
In fact, Kilwillie's looking for
a new cook. I'm sure he pays well.

425
00:25:04,428 --> 00:25:06,662
This is not
about the money.

426
00:25:06,663 --> 00:25:09,965
It's about making me feel sorry for being
the laird, having a duty to Glenbogle.

427
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:13,635
The laird's first duty is to his
people, not to his stately home.

428
00:25:13,636 --> 00:25:15,771
Which people are those?
The ones on the hillside

429
00:25:15,772 --> 00:25:17,606
having a laugh
while I put my back out?

430
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:19,841
I am the only people
I've got at the moment.

431
00:25:19,842 --> 00:25:22,144
You decided
to cozy up to Stella.

432
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:25,714
I don't believe it.

433
00:25:25,715 --> 00:25:28,650
You're stirring things up
because you're jealous.

434
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:32,621
You think, "Katrina's
gone, Lexie's next, hey!"

435
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:35,524
Am I a fringe benefit? Wouldn't
you rather a company car?

436
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:37,460
Dream on,
MacDonald.

437
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:40,396
That's why you come around
sticking your bosom in my face.

438
00:25:40,397 --> 00:25:43,532
You think, "Archie's a bloke.
That'll get his attention. "

439
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:45,501
It might have worked
if I wasn't so knackered.

440
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,803
<i>You're not knackered
yet, your lairdship.</i>

441
00:25:51,475 --> 00:25:53,842
Rights for workers!

442
00:25:57,046 --> 00:25:59,081
Rights for wor-

443
00:25:59,082 --> 00:26:02,884
Duncan.
I'm disappointed.

444
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:06,388
A fair day's work
for a fair day's work- no.

445
00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:08,657
It's all right.
I know what you're after.

446
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,466
Rights
for workers!

447
00:26:53,503 --> 00:26:56,071
How did we get
into this mess?

448
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,673
Leadership.

449
00:26:57,674 --> 00:27:01,277
Of course. it's my fault.
This isn't easy for me.

450
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:02,944
Do you think
it's easy for us?

451
00:27:02,945 --> 00:27:06,948
I want to work, but I'm not
going to be taken for a mug.

452
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:08,984
Why have I become
the only person

453
00:27:08,985 --> 00:27:10,986
who cares about
keeping Glenbogle going?

454
00:27:10,987 --> 00:27:13,556
You're not. That's why you
should have asked us for help,

455
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:15,558
instead of trying
to impose a solution.

456
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:18,894
- Look, it was either pay cuts or layoffs.
- That was Stella's strategy.

457
00:27:18,895 --> 00:27:22,264
- You didn't have to accept it.
- I didn't have any choice.

458
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:25,834
We always
have a choice, son.

459
00:28:06,943 --> 00:28:10,479
Tell me about golly.
Was he born on the estate?

460
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,013
Not exactly.

461
00:28:12,014 --> 00:28:14,683
He was hewn out of
the same rock as this house.

462
00:28:14,684 --> 00:28:16,952
You won't budge him
so easily.

463
00:28:16,953 --> 00:28:19,555
But he's one of these guys
that lives to work, isn't he?

464
00:28:19,556 --> 00:28:23,191
- You're looking for his weak point.
- It's standard procedure.

465
00:28:23,192 --> 00:28:27,996
According to whom? Thatcher's
bumper book of strike-busting?

466
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,633
<i>You think this place
is just another business,</i>

467
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:33,335
some clapped-out factory,
in hock to the unions?

468
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,672
- The principle's the same.
- I hadn't noticed principle coming into it.

469
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,075
Oh, don't go soft
on me, Archie.

470
00:28:40,076 --> 00:28:44,280
I give them 24 hours before they're
back here asking for a meeting.

471
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:46,715
- You think we can last that long?
- Why not?

472
00:28:46,716 --> 00:28:49,385
We have food,
we have light, we have power-

473
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,724
well, we have
food, anyway.

474
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,401
- Genny's gone down.
- Good.

475
00:29:05,402 --> 00:29:08,504
Maybe Archie will fall down
the stairs and land on Stella.

476
00:29:08,505 --> 00:29:10,972
Maybe now they'll be
willing to negotiate.

477
00:29:10,973 --> 00:29:14,142
Forget it.
We're not negotiating.

478
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:16,845
So what are we going to do?
Just sit around in the dark?

479
00:29:16,846 --> 00:29:18,914
Look, Stella wants
to settle this.

480
00:29:18,915 --> 00:29:20,783
Not you as well?!

481
00:29:20,784 --> 00:29:23,519
She flutters her eyelashes,
and you're blown away?

482
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,788
Why not? It's always worked for you-
483
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:28,190
okay, okay.

484
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:30,326
Lexie, what do
you propose?

485
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:32,994
I propose that we talk
to Kilwillie.

486
00:29:32,995 --> 00:29:34,463
I'm not working
for Kilwillie!

487
00:29:34,464 --> 00:29:37,199
Oh, no? you're the one
that wanted to be "senior

488
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,168
chief executive
in charge of ranging. "

489
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:42,237
Are we in this
together, or not?

490
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:46,041
Maybe it's just a wee bit
too soon to be giving up.

491
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:48,644
I'm not the one
talking about giving up.

492
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:50,813
Look, Stella can't run
that place without Archie.

493
00:29:50,814 --> 00:29:53,716
Maybe if we
talked to him-

494
00:29:53,717 --> 00:29:57,185
I've tried talking to Archie,
and he wouldn't listen.

495
00:29:57,186 --> 00:30:00,288
Aye, right.
That's what's bugging you.

496
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:02,558
I'm not going
to settle

497
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,893
for a few chocolate
biscuits and a job title.

498
00:30:04,894 --> 00:30:07,363
Oh, no...

499
00:30:07,364 --> 00:30:10,833
<i>unless of course,
it's Katrina's job title.</i>

500
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:12,334
Lexie-!

501
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:15,704
You can go back with your tails
between your legs. go ahead!

502
00:30:17,407 --> 00:30:19,641
<i>Mind, and wear brown,
though.</i>

503
00:30:19,642 --> 00:30:21,977
That way, when she wipes her
boots on you, it won't show.

504
00:30:27,016 --> 00:30:31,119
- What's the matter with it?
- It belongs in a museum.

505
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,788
<i>I thought it was
in a museum.</i>

506
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,723
Duncan usually
keeps it going.

507
00:30:34,724 --> 00:30:38,594
Oh, no, not again. What
are you for, exactly?

508
00:30:38,595 --> 00:30:41,397
I know you're the laird, but
do you actually serve a purpose?

509
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,668
Yes, I do, actually. Plugging
holes in your "brilliant strategy. "

510
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:48,937
Since you've started
playing your power games,

511
00:30:48,938 --> 00:30:51,306
my home has been
falling apart.

512
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,643
My parents are headed for a
divorce, I'm in line for a hernia.

513
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,913
If you want to cut overheads,
consider firing yourself,

514
00:30:57,914 --> 00:31:01,049
because all your so-called
economies are costing us a fortune.

515
00:31:03,185 --> 00:31:06,021
To think I let you sucker me
into dumping on my friends-

516
00:31:06,022 --> 00:31:07,756
where are you going?

517
00:31:07,757 --> 00:31:10,726
I've reached the end of my
learning curve. I'm taking off.

518
00:31:31,748 --> 00:31:33,582
Hi.

519
00:31:37,654 --> 00:31:41,457
I was looking for a hotbed
of sedition and conspiracy.

520
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:43,459
Very subtle,
Archie.

521
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,061
You should belong
to the MI5.

522
00:31:47,797 --> 00:31:49,498
I'm really sorry.

523
00:31:49,499 --> 00:31:52,634
It should never
have come to this.

524
00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:57,806
You tell Stella that
we're willing to meet.

525
00:31:57,807 --> 00:32:01,209
Hold on a minute-
you can't give in.

526
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,311
<i>I'm the one person
Stella can do without.</i>

527
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:06,815
If you guys go back now, I'm
stuffed. I came here to join you.

528
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,252
Welcome to the union.

529
00:32:11,253 --> 00:32:15,056
Well, as it happens,
we are short a member.

530
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,093
Where's Lexie?

531
00:32:18,094 --> 00:32:21,463
A wee bit
of a dispute...

532
00:32:21,464 --> 00:32:23,398
about her motives.

533
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,236
( distant thunder rumbles )

534
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:31,673
Oh, no.

535
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,912
Stella. I thought you'd gone home.

536
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,114
I would have, but my
bike stopped working.

537
00:32:39,115 --> 00:32:41,049
No problem.
I'll walk.

538
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:43,418
In this weather?
Oh, don't be so silly.

539
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,621
You must stay the night.
Come along. come on.

540
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:56,698
I hope you don't
mind salad.

541
00:32:56,699 --> 00:32:59,334
I'm afraid it's all
we can offer at the moment.

542
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:01,069
I'm not eating that.
I'm not a blasted cow.

543
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,805
<i>No, dear.
Cows are very useful.</i>

544
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:06,408
They give us milk and meat
and leather, whereas you-

545
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:08,577
ah...

546
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:12,080
the hunter/gatherer
brings forth his trophy.

547
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:15,383
Now you just have to wait
12 hours for it to defrost.

548
00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:18,386
That's what you think. Archie
showed me a few tricks of the trade-

549
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:20,488
<i>before you
drove him off.</i>

550
00:33:26,395 --> 00:33:28,229
Hector,
it's a microwave.

551
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,198
I know that.

552
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:32,935
It's electric.

553
00:33:32,936 --> 00:33:35,203
Well, of course
it's elec-

554
00:33:36,606 --> 00:33:39,274
ah.

555
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:43,411
But that is all this is
to Stella. It's just a job.

556
00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:45,948
<i>If we push her too far
she'll just flog the place,</i>

557
00:33:45,949 --> 00:33:47,616
and head off back to the
big smoke. End of story.

558
00:33:47,617 --> 00:33:50,085
No, she could have
done that weeks ago.

559
00:33:50,086 --> 00:33:53,321
She's got something else
going on.

560
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,123
I wish Katrina
was around.

561
00:33:55,124 --> 00:33:59,227
Am I not cute enough
for you, no?

562
00:33:59,228 --> 00:34:01,262
Yeah, but you don't have
her head for strategy.

563
00:34:01,263 --> 00:34:04,532
Katrina would never take Stella
head-on. She'd redefine the problem.

564
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:08,336
- How do you mean?
- She'd dream up some proposal

565
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,438
allowing the workers a say
in the management

566
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:12,708
and present it as some kind
of alternative approach.

567
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:15,844
That way, you keep your jobs
and Stella wouldn't lose face.

568
00:34:17,113 --> 00:34:18,847
Go on.

569
00:34:25,221 --> 00:34:27,355
Do you play golf,
Stella?

570
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:30,425
I'm sure she has more useful
things to do with her time.

571
00:34:30,426 --> 00:34:33,361
Like painting, you mean?
If you want to be useful,

572
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,363
why don't you give the ceiling
a couple of coats?

573
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,266
I paint
to express myself.

574
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:40,602
I never knew you had a
problem expressing yourself.

575
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:43,805
This looks wonderful.
What is it?

576
00:34:43,806 --> 00:34:45,674
Venison omelet.

577
00:34:45,675 --> 00:34:48,110
I'm sorry, I'm not
much of a cook.

578
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:50,578
On the contrary, you're a
very capable young woman.

579
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:53,515
One sometimes gets bored with
the purely decorative sort.

580
00:34:53,516 --> 00:34:56,584
I don't think anyone could ever
accuse you of being decorative.

581
00:34:56,585 --> 00:34:58,319
<i>- What do you mean?
- tell me-</i>

582
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,956
<i>did you try living together
after you got married?</i>

583
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:02,791
What?

584
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:06,094
You seem incapable of getting on unless
you have an entire wing to yourselves.

585
00:35:06,095 --> 00:35:09,131
I suppose you're used
to sharing a bathroom?

586
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,233
Yes, I am, actually.


587
00:35:12,234 --> 00:35:14,335
I've got four brothers
and two sisters

588
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:16,705
and we grew up in a
three-bedroom council house.

589
00:35:16,706 --> 00:35:18,940
<i>Sometimes we didn't have
anything to eat at all,</i>

590
00:35:18,941 --> 00:35:20,942
let alone venison
and quail's eggs.

591
00:35:20,943 --> 00:35:22,978
And we still managed
to like each other.

592
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:25,747
I'll get the plates.

593
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,182
( softly )
Oh...

594
00:35:27,183 --> 00:35:29,718
spare your nice
soft hands.

595
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:45,667
<i>( pipes gurgling )</i>

596
00:35:57,479 --> 00:35:59,114
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

597
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,717
If you want to use my
bathroom, Hector, forget it.

598
00:36:01,718 --> 00:36:03,852
There's no water in here,
either.

599
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,622
<i>( knocking )</i>

600
00:36:15,598 --> 00:36:18,433
Ah. there you are.

601
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:21,937
I wanted to say that...

602
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:24,940
I wouldn't be happy
living in my wing,

603
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:28,509
if you weren't knocking about
in the other one.

604
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:32,247
That's all, really.
Good night.

605
00:36:32,248 --> 00:36:35,350
- Are you going to be warm enough?
- I doubt it.

606
00:36:35,351 --> 00:36:37,786
Because there's
a rather effective,

607
00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:41,089
<i>if old fashioned way that
we could both keep warm.</i>

608
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:44,092
Oh...

609
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:54,602
<i>( faint squeaking,
scratching )</i>

610
00:37:03,746 --> 00:37:05,147
( screams )

611
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,288
- Is this what you wanted?
- Yes, dear. get mopping.

612
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:15,924
Oh, really. Why can't
we just wear wellies?

613
00:37:15,925 --> 00:37:18,827
- What are you doing?
- Pigeon in the water tank.

614
00:37:18,828 --> 00:37:21,329
<i>Archie's always dealt with them before.</i>

615
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:24,532
Shouldn't cost much to repair-
unless the ceiling comes down.

616
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,803
Stella, I know
you're the expert,

617
00:37:27,804 --> 00:37:31,206
but three people to run a
house the size of Glenbogle?

618
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,942
It's hardly
overmanning, is it?

619
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,059
This'll be you bringing us up
the bill for our coffee, then.

620
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,795
Actually, I'm here to discuss
staffing on the estate.

621
00:37:53,796 --> 00:37:56,397
Sorry, but we're
not available.

622
00:37:56,398 --> 00:38:00,035
We're now employees of the
Glenbogle worker's cooperative.

623
00:38:00,036 --> 00:38:01,970
Mm. catchy.

624
00:38:01,971 --> 00:38:05,140
Certainly more of a ring to it
than "two yokels and a cook. "

625
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:10,278
So would this cooperative be
interested in a long-term contract?

626
00:38:10,279 --> 00:38:14,549
I don't know.
What do you think?

627
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,786
I think she'll need to speak
to our area organizer, Duncan.

628
00:38:18,787 --> 00:38:21,823
You'll need to speak
to our area organizer.

629
00:38:21,824 --> 00:38:24,659
Don't tell me,
let me guess.

630
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,128
We supply the labor,
the fodder for the animals,

631
00:38:27,129 --> 00:38:29,497
fuel for the vehicles
for a fixed monthly figure.

632
00:38:29,498 --> 00:38:32,901
That way you get to control expenditure
and cut back in your overheads.

633
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:38,539
Okay. make me an offer and I'll see
how it compares to the other tenders.

634
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,842
You know you won't get a
better deal anywhere else.

635
00:38:40,843 --> 00:38:43,411
And Glenbogle will fall to
bits while you're looking.

636
00:38:43,412 --> 00:38:47,082
If I really wanted to save on
overheads, I'd sell the place.

637
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:50,252
Go back to London
and admit defeat?

638
00:38:50,253 --> 00:38:52,153
Write off
all those debts?

639
00:38:52,154 --> 00:38:54,655
That's not why
you came up here, is it?

640
00:38:54,656 --> 00:38:57,759
So- you'd supply

641
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,595
<i>- the ghillie, the ranger-
- head ranger.</i>

642
00:39:00,596 --> 00:39:03,398
<i>The head ranger-
and the housekeeper?</i>

643
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:06,634
Ah, yes...
the housekeeper.

644
00:39:08,537 --> 00:39:12,908
I might need a bit of time to work
on that. She's defected to Kilwillie.

645
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:15,343
I've got some business
with Kilwillie.

646
00:39:20,283 --> 00:39:22,550
( recording playing )

647
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,589
<i>� love is... �</i>

648
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,625
<i>� the sweetest thing... �</i>

649
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:32,460
right.

650
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,664
Fore.

651
00:39:38,867 --> 00:39:40,701
Yes, dear!
Hole in one!

652
00:39:53,983 --> 00:39:55,817
Kilwillie:
Oh, dear.

653
00:39:55,818 --> 00:39:58,286
She assured me that you
dispensed with her services.

654
00:39:58,287 --> 00:40:00,288
I wouldn't have
taken her on otherwise.

655
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:02,924
I'm sorry. I've put you
in a very awkward position-

656
00:40:02,925 --> 00:40:04,692
no, no, no.
But the thing is,

657
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,727
she does seem rather
set in her ways.

658
00:40:06,728 --> 00:40:09,797
When I suggested breakfast
might be slightly overcooked,

659
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:12,434
I thought she was going to
run me through with a sausage.

660
00:40:12,435 --> 00:40:14,535
She does take
some handling.

661
00:40:17,306 --> 00:40:19,240
<i>Lexie:
Have you seen that?</i>

662
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:22,810
It's a 12-ring with
fan-assisted ovens.

663
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:27,548
I've got an infrared
split-level toaster.

664
00:40:27,549 --> 00:40:30,918
<i>Although all I cook</i>

665
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:32,520
is boiled cabbage
and roly-poly.

666
00:40:32,521 --> 00:40:35,490
The man loves
off-school dinners.

667
00:40:35,491 --> 00:40:39,594
Did you see my room?
Satellite TV, power shower,

668
00:40:39,595 --> 00:40:43,264
though I can't grow mushrooms
like I did at Glenbogle.

669
00:40:43,265 --> 00:40:45,033
Lexie, I've been
an idiot.

670
00:40:45,034 --> 00:40:47,435
I couldn't see
what was under my nose.

671
00:40:47,436 --> 00:40:51,873
That was my bosom. I'm
sorry if it offended you.

672
00:40:51,874 --> 00:40:55,343
I didn't find your bosom
offensive, I found it-

673
00:40:55,344 --> 00:40:58,513
I was tired, I was angry,
I didn't know what I was saying.

674
00:40:58,514 --> 00:41:01,849
It's okay... I know.

675
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:04,285
Look, I'm sorry.

676
00:41:06,355 --> 00:41:07,922
You want me
to grovel?

677
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:12,127
Go ahead. If it makes
you feel any better.

678
00:41:12,128 --> 00:41:14,129
There's nothing going on
between me and Stella.

679
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:17,332
Grab her gaskins all you want,
Arch. It's no skin off my nose.

680
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:19,534
I wasn't- I wouldn't.
For goodness sake,

681
00:41:19,535 --> 00:41:22,270
Katrina's just left
- I'm hardly going to throw myself at Stella,

682
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,139
<i>even if she did
want to catch me.</i>

683
00:41:25,607 --> 00:41:28,843
Lexie, come back.
Please.

684
00:41:28,844 --> 00:41:30,611
And what for?

685
00:41:30,612 --> 00:41:32,980
What is there
for me at Glenbogle?

686
00:41:34,383 --> 00:41:37,352
Glenbogle's your home.
You've always said so.

687
00:41:38,587 --> 00:41:40,988
Well, maybe it's time
I flew the nest.

688
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,767
Well, I'll send
your stuff over then.

689
00:41:55,404 --> 00:41:57,672
Thanks.

690
00:41:57,673 --> 00:41:59,507
That would be great.

691
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:14,922
But that's blackmail. We've used
those forest tracks for generations.

692
00:42:14,923 --> 00:42:16,757
Look, you're running
commercial traffic out there.

693
00:42:16,758 --> 00:42:18,659
It's for your benefit
as much as ours.

694
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,628
It would make it
a formal arrangement.

695
00:42:20,629 --> 00:42:23,298
I'm not used to dealing with
my neighbors in these terms.

696
00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:26,000
On businesslike terms,
you mean?

697
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,836
What sort of figures
are we talking?

698
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,671
( dogs barking,
whimpering )

699
00:42:32,608 --> 00:42:34,709
- Aren't those...?
- Hector's? yeah.

700
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:38,113
He was always banging on about
what wonderful hunters they were

701
00:42:38,114 --> 00:42:41,882
but the only vermin they've managed
to tackle have been my brogues.

702
00:42:41,883 --> 00:42:43,551
Chewed them to pieces.

703
00:42:43,552 --> 00:42:46,521
I can't even let them run loose.
The other dogs just bully them.

704
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:50,492
<i>- Stella: I might be able to take
them off your hands. - Really?</i>

705
00:42:50,493 --> 00:42:53,128
Depends on what you're willing
to pay for access to your land.

706
00:42:53,129 --> 00:42:57,332
Of all the nerve.
3,000 a year.

707
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,602
Five.

708
00:43:00,603 --> 00:43:04,272
Three-five, and I'm
being very charitable.

709
00:43:04,273 --> 00:43:07,375
It's a shame
to see them like this.

710
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,645
<i>Hector's going
to be heartbroken.</i>

711
00:43:10,646 --> 00:43:13,114
Three-seven?

712
00:43:13,115 --> 00:43:15,383
Four.

713
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,485
Done.

714
00:43:17,486 --> 00:43:19,787
( dogs barking )

715
00:43:23,091 --> 00:43:25,059
( grunts )

716
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,695
Try it now.

717
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,100
( motor whirs )

718
00:43:58,794 --> 00:44:01,663
I've turned all the
radiators back on upstairs.

719
00:44:01,664 --> 00:44:04,031
Well, there must be
something you can do.

720
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:07,635
I could sacrifice an animal
- a sheep or a goat, maybe.

721
00:44:07,636 --> 00:44:10,738
Well, you could sacrifice
me if it brought Lexie back.

722
00:44:11,973 --> 00:44:13,774
You all got
gnats or something?

723
00:44:13,775 --> 00:44:17,312
Look at you standing there
scratching your heads.

724
00:44:17,313 --> 00:44:20,748
Honestly,
three grown men.

725
00:44:20,749 --> 00:44:24,719
All that wisdom,
experience and education,

726
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,089
you can't even handle a cranky
old boiler like this one.

727
00:44:31,327 --> 00:44:33,228
( boiler whirring )

728
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,901
Yes. brilliant.

729
00:44:42,671 --> 00:44:44,872
So you're back, then?

730
00:44:44,873 --> 00:44:46,774
I heard you had a pool
installed upstairs.

731
00:44:46,775 --> 00:44:48,676
Thought I might
give it a go.

732
00:44:48,677 --> 00:44:51,346
You mean Archie worked his
masculine charms on you?

733
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,917
I'll tell you
about Archie.

734
00:44:56,918 --> 00:44:58,919
It takes him a while
to get there,

735
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,688
but in the end,
he's loyal to his friends.

736
00:45:00,689 --> 00:45:03,758
<i>That's why I came back-
loyalty.</i>

737
00:45:03,759 --> 00:45:05,660
The only thing you're
loyal to is your money.

738
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,928
Someday you'll find out

739
00:45:07,929 --> 00:45:10,965
that your money doesn't
give a damn about you.

740
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,416
Shall we walk around the
loch and feed the midges?

741
00:45:28,417 --> 00:45:30,618
Yes, let's do that.

742
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:33,354
Or we could go to the
fallen tree and misbehave.

743
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,189
Whatever you say,
darling.

744
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,358
You do miss having
Monty and Rommel around

745
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,193
to lead you about,
don't you?

746
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,496
They always used to know
where they were going.

747
00:45:41,497 --> 00:45:43,798
Happy to get there,
even happier to get back.

748
00:45:45,734 --> 00:45:48,169
I do miss them,
rather, yes.

749
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:50,104
Perhaps I can
stand in for them.

750
00:45:50,105 --> 00:45:53,541
Of course you can,
darling.

751
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,511
<i>- Fetch.
- ( dogs barking )</i>

752
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:58,946
- Oh, Kilwillie!
- Hello!

753
00:45:58,947 --> 00:46:02,183
Were they
completely useless?

754
00:46:02,184 --> 00:46:04,385
Can't teach an old dog
new tricks, I'm afraid.

755
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:08,589
I don't know. You should
see Hector handle a mop.

756
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:10,891
<i>A mop?
You traitor.</i>

757
00:46:13,962 --> 00:46:16,130
<i>( faint squeaking )</i>

758
00:46:28,844 --> 00:46:31,078
<i>( thumping )</i>

759
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:37,218
- You brought them back.
- Who?

760
00:46:37,219 --> 00:46:40,120
Those "useless mutts" that were
eating us out of house and home.

761
00:46:40,121 --> 00:46:41,889
From now on,
they sleep in kennels

762
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,991
and they eat leftovers
like the rest of us.

763
00:46:43,992 --> 00:46:49,196
- You felt sorry for them? - Not at all.
Kilwillie paid me good money to take them.

764
00:46:49,197 --> 00:46:52,266
I've come to invite
you to a feast.

765
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,268
To show there are
no hard feelings.

766
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:57,104
A feast?
Who's paying for it?

767
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,640
When the power went,
the freezer thawed out.

768
00:46:59,641 --> 00:47:02,910
We have venison, trout and
a side of beef to get rid of.

769
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,879
And it's not good enough
for the dogs?

770
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,916
- 8:00. dress informal.
- I have a prior engagement.

771
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:11,218
Like what? a mug of cocoa
with Duncan's aunt?

772
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:14,789
Stella, I've brought you
a present from the dogs.

773
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,224
That really won't be
necessary, Hector.

774
00:47:17,225 --> 00:47:18,860
A token
of their esteem-

775
00:47:18,861 --> 00:47:22,029
<i>a splendid example
of apodemus sylvaticus-</i>

776
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:24,131
<i>the common
field mouse.</i>

777
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:27,067
Should I get rid of it,
or start charging him rent?

778
00:47:29,505 --> 00:47:31,806
( bagpipe playing )

779
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,208
Molly:
Good one, Duncan!

780
00:47:35,844 --> 00:47:38,212
<i>Hector:
Well done.</i>

781
00:47:46,622 --> 00:47:48,623
Welcome home, Lex.

782
00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:50,858
You've still got some
groveling to do.

783
00:48:00,569 --> 00:48:02,637
<i>( bagpipe continues )</i>

784
00:48:08,076 --> 00:48:09,944
<i>Hector:
Well done.</i>

785
00:48:40,141 --> 00:48:42,777
( motor buzzes )

786
00:48:54,623 --> 00:48:56,924
