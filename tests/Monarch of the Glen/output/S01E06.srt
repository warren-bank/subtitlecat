<i>( bagpipes playing )</i>

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,567
They'll be here
any minute.

3
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:23,570
- Calm down, Hector.
- We haven't won this race for years.

4
00:00:23,571 --> 00:00:25,472
It's time to restore
the family honor, Golly!

5
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:30,878
Here they come.

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,786
Right on time,
Kilwillie.

7
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:41,688
Lovely day,
old chap.

8
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:43,490
Yes, isn't it?

9
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:45,492
Well... Where is he?

10
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:48,896
- Where's who?
- Why, Archie, of course.

11
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:51,465
Aren't you here to
declare your intention

12
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:53,567
<i>- To race against me?
- Well, not you, Hector.</i>

13
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:55,469
The Flight of the Maiden
Boat Race

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,504
Is between the Laird
of Kilwillie Castle

15
00:00:57,505 --> 00:00:59,273
And the Laird
of Glenbogle.

16
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:04,111
Oh, dear.

17
00:01:04,112 --> 00:01:06,380
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

18
00:01:39,114 --> 00:01:41,848
<i>Kilwillie:... And in
accordance with the custom,</i>

19
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:44,351
<i>I invite the Laird
and the man of his choice</i>

20
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:47,888
To race against me
and the man of my choice

21
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:49,957
To rescue a fair maiden.

22
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,691
That's me.

23
00:01:51,692 --> 00:01:55,195
Do you, as a true
and honest man,

24
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:57,965
Undertake to accept
this solemn challenge

25
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:00,467
As is your right
and duty?

26
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:03,237
- He's worse than a wedding.
- Hector: Answer him, man!

27
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:04,972
- What do I say?
- I do.

28
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:06,540
Well?

29
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:10,377
Oh... I do.

30
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,313
I very much do.

31
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:17,584
This race has been rowed the
same way for nearly 200 years.

32
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:19,719
Father, I really don't
have time for all this.

33
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,556
Oh, in that case I'll tell
Kilwillie I'm taking your place.

34
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:24,959
The Laird has to rise
to the challenge.

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,861
Besides, Archie used to
be jolly good at rowing.

36
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:30,097
Your grandfather,
there was an oarsman.

37
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:31,398
Won this race
every time.

38
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:33,900
I'm expecting these people
from Glasgow any minute.

39
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:37,171
- What was that?
- Oh, nothing for you to worry about.

40
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:39,039
Who are these people
you're meeting?

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,042
They're coming to help Archie
market the spring water.

42
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:43,210
It's nothing sinister.

43
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:46,080
Of course it's sinister!
They're from Glasgow.

44
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:48,482
Why don't you go
and enjoy yourself?

45
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:50,684
- How, exactly?
- Oh, I don't know.

46
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:53,253
Shoot something.
That usually cheers you up.

47
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:03,364
<i>Man on radio: Later we'll be talking to
the Chief Executive of the Highland Council</i>

48
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:06,566
<i>To find out what role the Highlands has
to play in the new, devolved Scotland</i>

49
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:08,568
<i>And ask whether rule
from Westminster</i>

50
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:11,071
<i>Will simply be replaced
by rule from Edinburgh.</i>

51
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:13,040
<i>Man 2:
Don't trust anyone.</i>

52
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:16,377
<i>Don't trust them, says Davey,
but who can you trust then?</i>

53
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:18,479
<i>Man 3: Certainly not
the Thistle defense.</i>

54
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,081
<i>After two superbly crafted
goals in the first half,</i>

55
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:23,917
<i>They snatched defeat from the
jaws of victory last night,</i>

56
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:26,186
<i>Going down 3-2 against
a revived Clydebank.</i>

57
00:03:26,187 --> 00:03:27,621
<i>All the Bankie's goals-</i>

58
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:29,890
Yes!

59
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:32,626
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes!

60
00:03:32,627 --> 00:03:34,128
Yes!

61
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:36,696
I can just about
hear you, Archie.

62
00:03:36,697 --> 00:03:38,865
I'm afraid we're lost.

63
00:03:56,617 --> 00:03:59,686
I'm sorry, no photos. I've
only just heard the news myself,

64
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:03,023
And you can tell your colleague
I'm not ready to give interviews.

65
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:05,559
- Come again?
- Okay, yeah. Think I've got that.

66
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,761
See you in a bit then.
Yeah.

67
00:04:07,762 --> 00:04:10,431
But I will say
I intend to win,

68
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:12,466
And when I do,
I'll do all I can

69
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:14,634
For the real people
of this area.

70
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:19,005
My mother
always warned me

71
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:20,807
Not to come
this far north.

72
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:24,211
I'll bet she also told you
to keep away from strange men.

73
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:35,655
( gasps )

74
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:42,629
I tell you, I'm away
from Glenbogle for good.

75
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,764
What has Lexie
done now?

76
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:48,001
Don't talk to me about women.
I'm done with women!

77
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:51,004
<i>- Lexie: Is this your idea of a joke, Duncan?
- Sorry?</i>

78
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:53,240
I found this hanging
in the washing line.

79
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:54,774
That must've given
you a nasty turn,

80
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:57,244
Great ugly face
just staring at you.

81
00:04:57,245 --> 00:04:59,413
I'm used to that.
Spend all day round him.

82
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:02,882
Well?

83
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:04,751
It's got nothing
to do with me.

84
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:06,420
Well, someone
put it there.

85
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:08,522
Or something.

86
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:10,724
Have you never heard
of Red Bonnet?

87
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:14,995
- It's nonsense, Golly.
- You used to believe.

88
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:16,863
"please, Golly," you'd say,

89
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:19,133
"please tell us the tale of
Red Bonnet and his treasure. "

90
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:20,567
When I was six.

91
00:05:20,568 --> 00:05:22,802
I didn't know you really
believed all that stuff.

92
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:24,804
Archie, lad, in matters
of the other world,

93
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:26,773
It's best to keep
an open mind.

94
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:29,042
That fish could be
the pointer to untold riches.

95
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:31,044
So could that
spring water project

96
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:32,446
If these people
do a good job.

97
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:34,548
Just make sure they get
a feel for the place,

98
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:35,715
Okay?

99
00:05:36,784 --> 00:05:39,586
Archie.
( chuckles )

100
00:05:39,587 --> 00:05:42,022
Hi, Fiona Lennox,
Lennox marketing.

101
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:44,958
<i>- Man: Great costume.
- Oh, and this is Gavin.</i>

102
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:48,028
Welcome to Glenbogle.

103
00:05:49,096 --> 00:05:50,230
Thank you.

104
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,867
Hello.

105
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:03,977
Might actually win this year
with you and Archie rowing.

106
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:07,181
Aye, it'd be nice
to go out on a bang.

107
00:06:07,182 --> 00:06:10,150
- "go out"?
- I'm leaving.

108
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:13,019
Right. The best way is to
decide where the door is,

109
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,322
Put one foot in front of the
other and pass through it,

110
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:17,691
Taking care to open it, of course.

111
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:20,327
No, I mean for good.

112
00:06:20,328 --> 00:06:22,396
Why is that then?

113
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:24,431
Well...

114
00:06:28,135 --> 00:06:31,405
I've always felt I was born
to live a more exciting life,

115
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:34,074
Like the song says,
"in a city that never sleeps. "

116
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:36,677
- Such as?
- Dundee.

117
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:41,348
A place where I can discover
my true potential.

118
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:43,450
What did you have in mind,
particle physics?

119
00:06:43,451 --> 00:06:45,785
Mock all you like.

120
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:47,854
I'm born
for greater things.

121
00:06:49,123 --> 00:06:51,258
Lexie, dear,
I'm looking for

122
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:53,760
The biggest cake tin
we've got.

123
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:56,062
( stammering )
I- listen,

124
00:06:56,063 --> 00:06:58,732
There are things
I have to be doing, you know?

125
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:02,236
Just one more.
Great.

126
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:04,238
- And again.
- Fiona: And, uh...

127
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:06,139
This what we did

128
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,175
For the Pit Lochry
Spring Water.

129
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:10,844
Right.
Great.

130
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:29,062
We'll have to do
your logo

131
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:31,164
And find the right image
for the artwork-

132
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:33,267
Don't tell her
anything, Archie!

133
00:07:33,268 --> 00:07:36,035
You lot don't waste
any time, do you?

134
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:37,871
Katrina, this is
Fiona. She's-

135
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:39,172
From the press.

136
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:42,276
I'm sorry, Archie.
I wanted to tell you myself.

137
00:07:42,277 --> 00:07:44,344
Why is Golly
posing like that?

138
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:47,080
- Like what?
- Look to me. To me.

139
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:49,082
Like he's in an ad
for shortbread.

140
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,251
Oh, not shortbread-
water.

141
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:58,124
A marketing company.

142
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,993
I found them
in the yellow pages.

143
00:07:59,994 --> 00:08:01,261
And their master plan

144
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:03,263
Is to put Golly's
hairy legs on the label?

145
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:06,800
- They're just trying to capture
a feel for the place. - What?

146
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:09,135
To attract
outside investment.

147
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:11,371
Outside investment
means outside control.

148
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:14,007
The only reason I agreed
to help you with this

149
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:17,243
Was because the spring could
mean jobs for people round here.

150
00:08:17,244 --> 00:08:19,680
So how else are we
gonna raise the money?

151
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:22,482
I've been selected
as candidate

152
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:24,484
For the local
council election.

153
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,059
Excuse me.

154
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:43,136
"well done, Katrina.
You must be so pleased. "

155
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:45,205
How much time is
this gonna take up?

156
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:47,173
Archie, you're not
my employer.

157
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:49,175
Anyway, it's
the school holidays.

158
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:50,910
I'll have plenty of time
to campaign.

159
00:08:50,911 --> 00:08:55,048
Which will leave you no time at all
to help find funding for the spring.

160
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:57,016
We've got to think
long term.

161
00:08:57,017 --> 00:08:59,486
I might be able to get us
funding if I win this election.

162
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:01,788
Great. I'll tell you what, as backup,

163
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:03,724
I'll buy
a lottery ticket.

164
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:06,292
Thanks very much for
the vote of confidence.

165
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:07,694
You know that
Kilwillie's

166
00:09:07,695 --> 00:09:10,063
Held that council seat
for centuries.

167
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:12,298
Kilwillie's been systematically
exploiting this land-

168
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:14,668
All right, you're not
on the hustings yet.

169
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,703
Trust you not
to take an interest

170
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:18,638
In anyone but yourself.

171
00:09:19,974 --> 00:09:21,575
Excuse me.

172
00:09:22,977 --> 00:09:26,813
Um... I asked your butler
to take our bags to our rooms.

173
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:29,082
<i>- "Butler"?
- Mm.</i>

174
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,885
Hector, she wasn't
to know.

175
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:35,288
Father...

176
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:38,091
This is Fiona Lennox,
from Glasgow.

177
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:39,593
Katrina,
wait!

178
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:41,661
I- I'm so sorry,
Mr. MacDonald.

179
00:09:41,662 --> 00:09:43,530
I- I just
didn't realize

180
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:45,532
Who you were.
( laughs weakly )

181
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:46,833
Why should you?

182
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:48,835
I'll fetch help
for the bags.

183
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,609
Look, I was only trying
to move things along a bit.

184
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,745
That's not the point.
Why didn't you tell me?

185
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:03,116
We talked about working on the
spring water project as a team.

186
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:04,918
If we're a team,
you should consult me

187
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,353
- On everything.
- I know. I'm sorry.

188
00:10:07,354 --> 00:10:10,490
Look, why don't you come round
tonight and we'll talk strategy?

189
00:10:10,491 --> 00:10:13,159
What about
Saatchi and Saatchi?

190
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,896
I'll tell them I need a
private chat about the project.

191
00:10:15,897 --> 00:10:18,665
<i>- Our project.
- Okay.</i>

192
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:22,035
Tell you what, apparently a friendly
spirit brought us a pike last night.

193
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:24,304
<i>- A what?
- Don't ask.</i>

194
00:10:24,305 --> 00:10:26,306
But I could...
Cook it, you know.

195
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:29,042
I better go and earn my supper
by looking over those accounts.

196
00:10:36,317 --> 00:10:38,985
So that's where all
my mixed peel went.

197
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:40,153
Well...

198
00:10:40,154 --> 00:10:42,088
Don't they
always say, dear,

199
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:44,090
The quickest way
to a man's heart

200
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:46,626
- Is through his stomach?
- Mother always said

201
00:10:46,627 --> 00:10:49,128
It was straight through the
ribs with a boning knife.

202
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:51,565
Didn't think it was
anyone's birthday for a bit.

203
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:54,067
No. No, it's not.

204
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,742
Gavin, I think
you should let Archie

205
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:04,243
Show you around
the estate.

206
00:11:04,244 --> 00:11:06,045
Mm.
Super.

207
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:08,014
Careful with that.

208
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:10,550
It's expensive equipment.

209
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:13,252
Oh, uh...
Who's that?

210
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:15,088
Uh, it's Duncan.

211
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:16,823
Very cute.

212
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:18,792
Don't waste
your time on him,

213
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:20,961
He isn't interested
in lassies.

214
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,498
Is that so?

215
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,414
Hi.

216
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:42,782
Hello.

217
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:45,685
I was told there
was a fax machine.

218
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:47,253
Okay.

219
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:52,792
Listen, I'm sorry
about my behavior earlier.

220
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:54,528
It must've seemed
a bit odd.

221
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:57,764
It's okay. Archie
explained everything.

222
00:11:57,765 --> 00:11:59,533
Did he now?

223
00:11:59,534 --> 00:12:01,501
Good old Archie.

224
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:03,670
You must be thrilled
to be selected, though.

225
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:05,204
Congratulations.

226
00:12:05,205 --> 00:12:07,674
Do you know, you're the
first person to say that?

227
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:09,743
Well, I know
how much it means.

228
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:11,377
Really?

229
00:12:11,378 --> 00:12:13,379
Oh, I've been in
the party for years.

230
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,916
Often thought about
standing myself, but...

231
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:18,051
<i>Never quite
had the time or...</i>

232
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:20,020
Maybe the bottle.
Anyway, win or lose,

233
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:22,022
You're doing a really
good thing, Katrina.

234
00:12:22,023 --> 00:12:24,724
Well, thank you
very much.

235
00:12:28,495 --> 00:12:32,065
So, Roger, did Kilwillie send
you down here to spy on us?

236
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:33,433
Leave the lad alone.

237
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:35,769
He's here just to help
with the launching site.

238
00:12:40,074 --> 00:12:43,777
So... Roger... How
often do you work out?

239
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:56,522
People around here should
be running their own affairs,

240
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:59,358
<i>Running the estate,
the spring water scheme,</i>

241
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:02,996
Instead of tolerating
some outdated feudal regime.

242
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:06,466
You make it sound like
Glenbogle's still in the dark ages.

243
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,034
Well, it is.

244
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:10,336
Take this silly boat race
they're having tomorrow.

245
00:13:10,337 --> 00:13:14,240
- A boat race?
- Grown men pretending to rescue

246
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:16,776
Defenseless maidens
from across the loch.

247
00:13:16,777 --> 00:13:19,378
It just sounds
like a bit of... Fun.

248
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:23,416
Well, it is.
But it's backward-looking.

249
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:26,019
<i>It's like when we play
the English at football,</i>

250
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,222
All those banners saying
"Remember Bannockburn. "

251
00:13:29,223 --> 00:13:31,758
When are we going
to forget about the past

252
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,060
And do something
about the future?

253
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:36,229
So, what's
your game plan

254
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,264
For the election?

255
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:41,901
<i>- Game plan?
- Campaign strategy?</i>

256
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,238
I take it
you have one?

257
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:55,481
You know,
living round here,

258
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:57,751
You forget how fantastic the scenery is.

259
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,891
I can manage!

260
00:14:04,892 --> 00:14:07,293
- I said I can-
- aah!

261
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:08,995
Roger! Are you
all right?

262
00:14:08,996 --> 00:14:10,864
It was an accident!

263
00:14:21,742 --> 00:14:23,743
Yes, it's the ring,
all right.

264
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:25,712
And what's so special
about it?

265
00:14:25,713 --> 00:14:27,613
It's the Laird's
ring, Archie,

266
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:29,749
Passed down through
generations.

267
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,585
To my eternal shame,
I lost it some years ago.

268
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:34,253
Now you've got it
back again.

269
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:36,990
- It's Kilwillie's now.
- What?

270
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:40,126
Tradition says the ring belongs
to the clan that finds it.

271
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,861
And Kilwillie's man
found it.

272
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:43,897
You're joking. Surely
you can prove it's ours.

273
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:45,932
I don't think your 16th century ancestor

274
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:47,567
Kept the receipt,
Archie.

275
00:14:47,568 --> 00:14:49,002
16th century?

276
00:14:49,003 --> 00:14:51,037
Must be worth
a fortune.

277
00:14:51,038 --> 00:14:54,074
This could be the answer
to all our problems.

278
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:55,675
My father
gave me that ring.

279
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:57,610
His father
gave it to him,

280
00:14:57,611 --> 00:15:00,814
Just as every Laird did
for nearly 400 years.

281
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:03,850
<i>There are more important
things in life than money,</i>

282
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:06,485
And even if
we still did have it,

283
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:08,454
I'd never sell it.

284
00:15:08,455 --> 00:15:10,356
Never, do you hear?

285
00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:17,997
I was only thinking
of him... Of all this.

286
00:15:17,998 --> 00:15:19,498
I know.

287
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:22,936
So what do you know about
the other candidates then?

288
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:25,171
There's only one
worth worrying about,

289
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:27,207
And he's over there.

290
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,308
Angus Kilwillie.

291
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:33,947
It's quite an interesting
little trinket.

292
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:36,449
Well done. Thank you.

293
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,818
It's Red Bonnet
you have to thank.

294
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:40,787
Another wives' tale.

295
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:42,989
All the same, best
to keep an open mind

296
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,225
In matters of
the other world.

297
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:48,728
There's only one world that
matters, Golly, and this is it.

298
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:51,131
A man's got to take control
of his own destiny.

299
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:54,634
Sitting councilor, local
landowner, and robber baron.

300
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:56,736
<i>He's had the place
in his pocket for years.</i>

301
00:15:56,737 --> 00:16:00,240
<i>- Fiona: And what sleaze do we have on him?
- Sorry?</i>

302
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:02,408
You know, dirt.
Scandal.

303
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:05,111
Hang on, you're not
in Glasgow now.

304
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:07,747
We don't run those type
of campaigns around here.

305
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:10,750
Oh, really? So how come he's
been in office so long then?

306
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,486
I bet he has his tricky
little ways and means.

307
00:16:13,487 --> 00:16:15,721
Miss Finlay.

308
00:16:15,722 --> 00:16:17,991
I gather you're
standing against me.

309
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:20,860
How did you know that? I
only found out this morning.

310
00:16:20,861 --> 00:16:23,429
Oh... I've got
my ways and means.

311
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,632
( chuckling )
so what's your platform?

312
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:30,103
Oh, you'll find out
soon enough, Mr. Kilwillie.

313
00:16:30,104 --> 00:16:32,806
Going to throw our last
dastardly landowners out, are you?

314
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:35,809
Oh, dear me. Better get home
and pull up my drawbridge.

315
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,976
<i>( chuckling )</i>

316
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:38,812
Well, good luck.

317
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:40,914
<i>And may the best man win.</i>

318
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,020
Now that you mention it,
there was a bit of gossip

319
00:16:47,021 --> 00:16:50,190
About him and a certain lady
from Loch Nacree.

320
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:54,027
- Hah!
- Hector!

321
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:55,728
Haven't you heard
of knocking?

322
00:16:55,729 --> 00:16:57,596
If you want to get rid
of me, it's less messy

323
00:16:57,597 --> 00:16:59,498
To sue for divorce!
What are you playing at?

324
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:01,500
- All is not lost!
- Hector, please!

325
00:17:01,501 --> 00:17:04,437
The only way to get that
ring back is by combat!

326
00:17:04,438 --> 00:17:06,672
- Combat?
- I shall challenge Kilwillie!

327
00:17:06,673 --> 00:17:08,674
You will do
no such thing!

328
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:12,145
( growls )

329
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:15,781
Hector,
now get a grip.

330
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:17,783
You are not
a child anymore.

331
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:20,486
Really? Then why does
everybody treat me like one?

332
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:22,488
"don't you worry
about it, Hector. "

333
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:25,291
"none of your business, Hector. "
"go and play with your toys, Hector. "

334
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:27,994
Well, I know
when I'm not needed!

335
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:33,699
Hector, I just came
to tell you that I...

336
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,534
Made you a cake.

337
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:37,803
<i>( door slams )</i>

338
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:43,042
So, no one special
back in Glasgow then,

339
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:45,178
Nice boy like you?

340
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,413
I've just come out of
a messy relationship.

341
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:51,550
Really?
What was he like?

342
00:17:51,551 --> 00:17:53,586
It's always the cute ones, isn't it?

343
00:17:55,055 --> 00:17:56,956
Why's he always
so miserable?

344
00:17:56,957 --> 00:17:58,958
He thinks that
a place like this

345
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:01,261
Has got nothing to
offer someone like him.

346
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:02,795
He's right there.

347
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:05,098
- Hey, Duncan.
- What?

348
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:07,633
How about I get
some shots of you?

349
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:12,005
Oh.

350
00:18:12,006 --> 00:18:13,406
Sure.

351
00:18:17,978 --> 00:18:20,546
Once she starts with this election
nonsense, I'll never see her.

352
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:22,748
Then stop referring
to it as nonsense.

353
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:25,184
People find
different things important.

354
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:26,786
You should encourage
Katrina more,

355
00:18:26,787 --> 00:18:28,221
Listen to her more.

356
00:18:28,222 --> 00:18:30,489
That's the secret of
a good partnership.

357
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,726
- I suppose you're right.
- Isn't that how it works with Justine?

358
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:35,795
- That's different.
- Well, of course it is.

359
00:18:35,796 --> 00:18:37,696
She's your girlfriend.

360
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:39,999
It must be a very
understanding relationship

361
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,468
If it can work while
you're both so far apart.

362
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:43,736
Yes, it must be.

363
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:46,472
You must miss her
very much.

364
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:48,474
Right. I'll just go check on that fish.

365
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:50,276
Oh, tell Lexie
I'll be eating upstairs.

366
00:18:50,277 --> 00:18:52,145
- You sure you don't mind?
- Of course not.

367
00:18:52,146 --> 00:18:54,914
I'll leave you and Katrina
to have a good time.

368
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:57,516
It's a business dinner,
mother.

369
00:18:57,517 --> 00:18:59,152
Of course it is.

370
00:19:08,695 --> 00:19:10,964
Katrina will
never eat that.

371
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:12,898
I'll have you know
this is a big delicacy

372
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:14,467
In certain parts
of Europe,

373
00:19:14,468 --> 00:19:16,402
A recipe known
only to a few.

374
00:19:16,403 --> 00:19:19,973
Anyway, I called Justine
for some advice.

375
00:19:19,974 --> 00:19:23,009
Oh, really? "darling, I'm doing
a candlelight dinner for Katrina.

376
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,511
Could you help me
perk up my pike?"

377
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:27,613
Just shut up
and drain the veg.

378
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:30,249
But you did tell her
who it was for, right?

379
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,352
In your own time.

380
00:19:57,111 --> 00:20:00,046
Hello?
I can hardly hear you.

381
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:03,116
<i>- You're an hour late.
- What? The line's really bad.</i>

382
00:20:03,117 --> 00:20:05,084
Look, I'll come over
to your place.

383
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:07,320
Oh...

384
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:11,391
Archie, I am so sorry.

385
00:20:11,392 --> 00:20:13,959
This is so embarrassing.

386
00:20:18,598 --> 00:20:20,633
Fiona and I
just got talking.

387
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:22,568
How could you forget?

388
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:27,873
Fiona was helping me
draw up my manifesto.

389
00:20:27,874 --> 00:20:29,708
She's in the party.

390
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:31,944
I'm so sorry.

391
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:35,014
Fiona's working for me.

392
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:38,184
I thought she
was working for us.

393
00:20:40,554 --> 00:20:42,955
<i>( clock striking )</i>

394
00:20:57,037 --> 00:21:00,239
<i>( clock ticking loudly )</i>

395
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:06,912
Could you pass
the salt, please?

396
00:21:09,216 --> 00:21:11,650
- Pepper?
- No, thanks.

397
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:20,693
He was a magnificent
sight, my father...

398
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:24,997
Thrashing his way
through the waters.

399
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:26,832
Never lost a boat race-

400
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,267
Ever.

401
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:30,436
Fine huntsman, too.

402
00:21:30,437 --> 00:21:32,505
Everybody looked up to him.

403
00:21:32,506 --> 00:21:34,440
People still needed him...

404
00:21:34,441 --> 00:21:36,041
Until the day he died.

405
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:39,612
Who needs me, eh?

406
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:43,249
- I-
- I was just-


407
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,184
- After you.
- Go ahead.

408
00:21:46,286 --> 00:21:48,187
I just wanted to say
I'm really pleased

409
00:21:48,188 --> 00:21:49,955
You were nominated
for the election.

410
00:21:51,057 --> 00:21:52,158
Thank you.

411
00:21:53,494 --> 00:21:55,394
So you think you might
be able to get us

412
00:21:55,395 --> 00:21:57,163
The money for the spring
if you win?

413
00:21:57,164 --> 00:21:59,432
Listen, could we
discuss this tomorrow?

414
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:02,401
It's just that Fiona-

415
00:22:02,402 --> 00:22:04,837
I promised her
I wouldn't be long.

416
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:06,305
Fine.

417
00:22:06,306 --> 00:22:09,942
I thought you wanted
to talk about it tonight.

418
00:22:09,943 --> 00:22:13,045
Come on, the spring's not
going to dry up overnight.

419
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:15,781
<i>- No, but Justine's patience might.
- Oh.</i>

420
00:22:17,117 --> 00:22:19,152
So that's what
this is about.

421
00:22:19,153 --> 00:22:20,620
Sorry?

422
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:22,155
You want to get the spring

423
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:24,123
Up and running as soon
as possible

424
00:22:24,124 --> 00:22:26,959
So you can skip back
to your girlfriend in London.

425
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,630
- I do not skip. - Where you can manage
your swanky restaurant

426
00:22:30,631 --> 00:22:33,366
And get back to what
you probably call normality.

427
00:22:35,469 --> 00:22:37,936
You seem very sure
of what I want.

428
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:42,041
You know you're not
going to stay here forever.

429
00:22:44,344 --> 00:22:45,811
<i>Go on then.</i>

430
00:22:47,481 --> 00:22:50,183
Tell me you've decided
to stay and run the estate.

431
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,055
Tell me that this
is more important to you

432
00:22:56,056 --> 00:22:57,657
Than anything else.

433
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:05,431
I'm as cynical
as the next man,

434
00:23:05,432 --> 00:23:07,700
But best to keep
an open mind

435
00:23:07,701 --> 00:23:09,502
Where the other world
is concerned.

436
00:23:09,503 --> 00:23:11,136
If it exists,

437
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:13,673
I hope it makes more
sense than this one.

438
00:23:13,674 --> 00:23:15,408
Go on, Golly.

439
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:17,276
Now, take Red Bonnet.

440
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:19,378
Legend has it that he
steals into houses

441
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:20,879
In the dead of night.

442
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,682
<i>He means no harm.</i>

443
00:23:22,683 --> 00:23:24,417
<i>He leaves you a clue</i>

444
00:23:24,418 --> 00:23:26,852
<i>To where a treasure
is to be found,</i>

445
00:23:26,853 --> 00:23:28,421
<i>Then returns
the next night</i>

446
00:23:28,422 --> 00:23:30,223
<i>To claim some supper
as a reward.</i>

447
00:23:30,224 --> 00:23:33,426
<i>- Oh, come on.
- Duncan: No, Golly's right.</i>

448
00:23:33,427 --> 00:23:36,195
The fish was a sign.

449
00:23:36,196 --> 00:23:38,698
It led to the ring.

450
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:41,534
Okay, okay, I'm sorry to apply
logic to the situation,

451
00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:44,036
But if he was hungry,
why didn't he just eat the fish?

452
00:23:44,037 --> 00:23:46,505
Maybe he's
a vegetarian spirit.

453
00:23:50,677 --> 00:23:53,879
Ha ha. People always mock
what they're afraid of.

454
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,482
Ain't that the truth?

455
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:59,619
Who could be afraid
of a little man in a red cap?

456
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,021
The forest is full of less
kindly spirits than Red Bonnet.

457
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:05,524
Have you
seen them, Golly?

458
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:07,493
<i>- No.
- Archie: You see?</i>

459
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:09,662
Nor would I want to.

460
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:12,331
But I've heard them.
In the night.

461
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:15,368
<i>Whispering.
Caterwauling.</i>

462
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:17,403
Coming from nowhere.

463
00:24:17,404 --> 00:24:19,272
Coming from everywhere.

464
00:24:19,273 --> 00:24:22,841
Ah, it's just the wind
or small furry creatures.

465
00:24:22,842 --> 00:24:25,544
Maybe.
But have you not heard

466
00:24:25,545 --> 00:24:28,648
The story of Barrach-Bayne,
the Mad MacDonald?

467
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:30,949
Didn't like women.
Was that the one?

468
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,287
<i>He spent the night alone in the
woods, day before his wedding.</i>

469
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:37,690
He was to marry the daughter
of a neighboring chief

470
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:40,225
At the Great Clan Gathering
of 1611.

471
00:24:40,226 --> 00:24:42,495
What happened?

472
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,632
<i>Well, they say he
lost his mind that night...</i>

473
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:49,735
Or had it taken from him.

474
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:52,204
The next day,
at the gathering,

475
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:55,675
He lifted up his betrothed
like this...

476
00:24:55,676 --> 00:24:58,010
And wailing like a banshee,

477
00:24:58,011 --> 00:25:01,947
Pitched her headlong
into the Kinrothie bog.

478
00:25:01,948 --> 00:25:05,117
Near brought down
the MacDonalds.

479
00:25:05,118 --> 00:25:08,053
Led to 40 years warfare
in this glen.

480
00:25:08,054 --> 00:25:12,024
Way I heard it, she looked better when she
came out of the bog than when she went in.

481
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:13,926
<i>Nevertheless...</i>

482
00:25:14,994 --> 00:25:17,996
No MacDonald since then...

483
00:25:17,997 --> 00:25:21,266
Has ever spent
the night alone...

484
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:23,235
In those woods.

485
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:28,106
It wouldn't
bother me if I did.

486
00:25:32,178 --> 00:25:33,846
Well, it wouldn't!

487
00:25:36,717 --> 00:25:39,719
I'm up at the crack of dawn
for the boat race.

488
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:44,323
<i>You think I'm scared,
don't you?</i>

489
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:48,494
Right, let's do it.

490
00:25:58,137 --> 00:26:01,139
Right, this'll do.

491
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,742
Torch.

492
00:26:04,344 --> 00:26:06,479
You sure you still
want to do this?

493
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,682
Yeah, it's just what I need-
a night out of that madhouse.

494
00:26:09,683 --> 00:26:11,684
Okay, it's all yours.

495
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:18,023
<i>Duncan:
Sounds a bit silly.</i>

496
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:20,092
Go on, it'll be a laugh,

497
00:26:20,093 --> 00:26:22,862
And it might just be the
image we need for the label.

498
00:26:22,863 --> 00:26:25,130
Oh, pardon me.

499
00:26:25,131 --> 00:26:27,266
I was looking for Golly.

500
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:29,234
I'll go and get
my stuff.

501
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:36,942
Duncan...

502
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:38,944
You do know
about Gavin, don't you?

503
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:40,646
I know he's
the first person

504
00:26:40,647 --> 00:26:42,548
Ever took me
seriously.

505
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:44,417
Oh?

506
00:26:44,418 --> 00:26:46,852
Aye. And he agrees
I don't belong here.

507
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:48,754
Reckons I should
move to Glasgow,

508
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:50,623
Find myself.

509
00:26:50,624 --> 00:26:53,258
What if you're not there
when you get there?

510
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:55,394
Oh, go on, mock.

511
00:26:55,395 --> 00:26:58,063
You're just jealous 'cause
you're gonna spend your whole life

512
00:26:58,064 --> 00:27:00,098
Skivvying here
for other people

513
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:02,100
While I'm-
I'm moving on.

514
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:03,936
( sighs )

515
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:05,270
You're right.

516
00:27:05,271 --> 00:27:07,406
Of course.

517
00:27:07,407 --> 00:27:09,041
I wish you
all the best.

518
00:27:10,677 --> 00:27:12,845
But may I give you
a bit of advice?

519
00:27:14,213 --> 00:27:15,815
What?

520
00:27:15,816 --> 00:27:17,750
It's just...

521
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:21,787
It's best to try and be
like those big city types-

522
00:27:21,788 --> 00:27:24,356
You know, if you
want to fit in.

523
00:27:24,357 --> 00:27:27,059
- How do you mean?
- Well...

524
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,629
For a start,
they're very touchy-feely.

525
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,732
Lots of...
Hugging and stuff.

526
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:37,670
- Aye, I've seen them.
- Mm.

527
00:27:37,671 --> 00:27:39,171
What else?

528
00:27:40,406 --> 00:27:42,341
So they know
you're confident,

529
00:27:42,342 --> 00:27:45,010
They need eye contact.

530
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:49,014
<i>Long, lingering
eye contact.</i>

531
00:27:52,051 --> 00:27:53,652
Right.

532
00:27:56,322 --> 00:27:58,991
<i>Molly's voice: Pull yourself
together. You're not a child any more.</i>

533
00:27:58,992 --> 00:28:01,326
<i>Hector: Then why does
everyone treat me like one?</i>

534
00:28:01,327 --> 00:28:03,829
<i>"don't worry about it, Hector. "
"none of your business, Hector. "</i>

535
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,798
<i>"go play with
your toys, Hector. "</i>

536
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,733
<i>Well, I know
when I'm not needed.</i>

537
00:28:13,072 --> 00:28:14,740
<i>( twig snaps )</i>

538
00:28:14,741 --> 00:28:16,942
<i>( faint footsteps running )</i>

539
00:28:23,216 --> 00:28:25,217
<i>( pot clanks )</i>

540
00:28:25,218 --> 00:28:27,119
<i>( lock turns )</i>

541
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:31,557
<i>( owl hooting )</i>

542
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:43,569
<i>( clanking )</i>

543
00:28:51,177 --> 00:28:52,611
- Ow!
- Oh!

544
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,214
Aaah!

545
00:28:56,215 --> 00:28:59,652
- I couldn't sleep, so I came
down to add some walnuts.

546
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:02,855
Maybe Red Bonnet
doesn't care for walnuts.

547
00:29:02,856 --> 00:29:05,824
It was Hector's
favorite.

548
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:07,325
The thing is,

549
00:29:07,326 --> 00:29:09,461
We've all been
ignoring him lately.

550
00:29:09,462 --> 00:29:11,997
How can anyone
ignore Hector?

551
00:29:11,998 --> 00:29:14,867
We all run round him
like blue-

552
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:17,169
Like people running round
after Hector.

553
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,171
I know, like people
running round

554
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:22,374
After a child.
He hates that.

555
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:24,509
Poor old Hector.

556
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,946
I'm more to blame
than anyone.

557
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:29,481
He's been sneaking off
at night lately,

558
00:29:29,482 --> 00:29:31,450
Which he does
when he's feeling...

559
00:29:31,451 --> 00:29:32,851
Thoughtful.

560
00:29:32,852 --> 00:29:34,553
I should have
just sat him down

561
00:29:34,554 --> 00:29:36,488
And given him
a good talking to,

562
00:29:36,489 --> 00:29:39,224
Told him that we all
need him round here.

563
00:29:39,225 --> 00:29:43,495
Instead, I made this
stupid cake! ( crying )

564
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,969
- How long's this been here then?
- About half an hour.

565
00:29:53,506 --> 00:29:56,008
I used to love
night fishing.

566
00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:58,911
I don't get much chance
to do it in London, though.

567
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,279
I'm sure London has other
nighttime attractions.

568
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,482
( yawning )
yeah, I guess so.

569
00:30:03,483 --> 00:30:06,218
You ought to be in bed
getting a good night's sleep,

570
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:08,353
Preparing your mind and
body for tomorrow's battle.

571
00:30:08,354 --> 00:30:10,388
It's not a battle,
it's a boat race.

572
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:16,561
How did that ring
end up in the loch?

573
00:30:16,562 --> 00:30:19,498
Didn't you hear?
Red Bonnet put it there.

574
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:22,034
- Father.
- I lost it swimming.

575
00:30:22,035 --> 00:30:24,003
<i>Stupid thing to do.</i>

576
00:30:24,004 --> 00:30:26,404
"damn stupid thing
to do, Hector,"

577
00:30:26,405 --> 00:30:29,574
My father said.
"you've really let me down.

578
00:30:29,575 --> 00:30:33,979
I despair of you ever
amounting to anything. "

579
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,582
I wanted to explain it was an
accident, it could happen to anybody,

580
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:39,918
That I was sorry.
Sorry I'd let him down.

581
00:30:40,987 --> 00:30:42,821
Well, why didn't you?

582
00:30:42,822 --> 00:30:44,890
Because he was
a cantankerous old git

583
00:30:44,891 --> 00:30:46,892
Who was impossible
to talk to.

584
00:30:46,893 --> 00:30:49,094
Can you imagine having
a father like that?

585
00:30:49,095 --> 00:30:51,363
No. No, I can't.

586
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:08,513
- That was-
- shh!

587
00:31:08,514 --> 00:31:10,816
Red Bonnet.
We just saw Red Bonnet.

588
00:31:10,817 --> 00:31:12,317
Come on.

589
00:31:15,454 --> 00:31:18,390
- ( Archie snorts )
- ye gods.

590
00:31:18,391 --> 00:31:20,659
Now I've seen everything.

591
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,095
Gavin: That's it, Duncan.
More of that. More!

592
00:31:23,096 --> 00:31:25,397
Yeah. Great!
( laughs )

593
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:27,800
That's it.
Right arm up.

594
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:30,402
What's Duncan
playing at?

595
00:31:30,403 --> 00:31:32,237
Golly was right.

596
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:34,439
Some things are beyond
human comprehension.

597
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,641
<i>Duncan: It's been a
real stroke of fortune...</i>

598
00:31:36,642 --> 00:31:39,044
Me meeting you.

599
00:31:39,045 --> 00:31:40,979
I feel
like I can-

600
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,781
I can see
my whole future

601
00:31:42,782 --> 00:31:44,950
Stretching out
in front of me.

602
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:47,986
- The real me.
- Good man.

603
00:31:47,987 --> 00:31:49,955
That's the first step...

604
00:31:49,956 --> 00:31:51,924
Admitting to yourself
who you are.

605
00:31:51,925 --> 00:31:53,458
Aye.

606
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:55,928
And you'll meet plenty
more like you in Glasgow.

607
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:13,946
Thanks for all
your advice.

608
00:32:15,048 --> 00:32:16,448
No problem.

609
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:25,057
You've really changed
my outlook.

610
00:32:26,793 --> 00:32:28,660
I was thinking...

611
00:32:28,661 --> 00:32:30,763
When I move to Glasgow,

612
00:32:30,764 --> 00:32:33,065
Could I stay with you
for a while?

613
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:35,333
Oh, Duncan...

614
00:32:35,334 --> 00:32:37,770
I'm really flattered.

615
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:39,938
Flattered?

616
00:32:39,939 --> 00:32:41,206
Look...

617
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:44,209
It's not you.

618
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,610
It's me.

619
00:33:12,906 --> 00:33:15,908
- Oi.
- What are you doing here?

620
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:18,610
Fiona and I got so wrapped
up in the manifesto,

621
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:20,712
Molly said I
could stay the night.

622
00:33:20,713 --> 00:33:22,514
<i>You look rough.</i>

623
00:33:22,515 --> 00:33:25,918
Well, all in all,
it was a pretty rough night.

624
00:33:29,722 --> 00:33:31,690
I said some things
last night-

625
00:33:31,691 --> 00:33:33,558
Yeah, well, you were
probably right.

626
00:33:36,595 --> 00:33:38,263
Look, I've got a...

627
00:33:38,264 --> 00:33:39,965
Race to row.

628
00:33:42,168 --> 00:33:43,601
Good luck.

629
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:08,126
Oh, where is everyone?

630
00:34:12,798 --> 00:34:14,699
( lightly snoring )

631
00:34:18,804 --> 00:34:21,706
I love you,
you silly old fool.

632
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:26,411
I better go.
Golly's taking me to the woods.

633
00:34:26,412 --> 00:34:29,047
We may not be able to get
your father's ring back,

634
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:31,549
But at least we can try
and win this race for him.

635
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,719
Mother, you're a genius!
The race!

636
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:40,458
- Lexie: How did the photo shoot
go last night? - Smashing.

637
00:34:40,459 --> 00:34:42,861
In fact, better than I
could've possibly imagined.

638
00:34:42,862 --> 00:34:45,830
- Really?
- Yeah. It went so well,

639
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:48,267
Duncan's agreed to come to
Glasgow as soon as possible.

640
00:34:48,268 --> 00:34:50,802
- He's gonna move in with me.
- You're joking!

641
00:34:50,803 --> 00:34:52,637
I'm not.

642
00:34:52,638 --> 00:34:55,640
Duncan's not quite the
full shilling sometimes.

643
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:58,710
- Is that so?
- He's easily led astray.

644
00:34:58,711 --> 00:35:01,213
You'd have firsthand
experience of that, would you?

645
00:35:01,214 --> 00:35:04,216
- I just don't want to see him get hurt.
- Why is that, then?

646
00:35:04,217 --> 00:35:06,218
Uh, he's a pal.

647
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:08,220
Real-ly?

648
00:35:08,221 --> 00:35:11,256
Look, he'd be lost
in Glasgow.

649
00:35:11,257 --> 00:35:13,926
He'd miss all his mates
and... We'd miss him.

650
00:35:15,528 --> 00:35:17,695
Oh, Dunc!

651
00:35:17,696 --> 00:35:20,365
Lexie here has got
something to tell you.

652
00:35:20,366 --> 00:35:21,900
Uh, yeah.

653
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:23,668
Good luck
in the boat race.

654
00:35:23,669 --> 00:35:25,170
Yeah, thanks.

655
00:35:25,171 --> 00:35:26,871
( deep voice )
give 'em hell, big boy!

656
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:37,882
Has Archie
lost his bottle?

657
00:35:37,883 --> 00:35:40,018
Thought you weren't
interested in this.

658
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:41,987
Oh, could be
quite fun.

659
00:35:41,988 --> 00:35:43,322
Here's Archie.

660
00:35:45,724 --> 00:35:48,260
I thought you'd thrown in
the towel, lad!

661
00:35:48,261 --> 00:35:51,063
Golly: Right, let it begin!
The maidens are in position.

662
00:35:51,064 --> 00:35:53,031
Hold on, Golly.

663
00:35:53,032 --> 00:35:54,866
Kilwillie,

664
00:35:54,867 --> 00:35:58,070
I challenge you to combat for
the ring of my forefathers.

665
00:35:58,071 --> 00:35:59,371
I beg your pardon?

666
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:02,140
I wanna race you for
that ring you're wearing.

667
00:36:02,141 --> 00:36:04,943
That's out of the question.
It's mine by right.

668
00:36:04,944 --> 00:36:06,778
You're not scared,
are you?

669
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:10,382
Believe me, Archie,

670
00:36:10,383 --> 00:36:12,451
All the incentive
in the world

671
00:36:12,452 --> 00:36:14,552
Won't help you win.

672
00:36:14,553 --> 00:36:17,022
Right.
Let battle commence!

673
00:36:17,023 --> 00:36:19,791
Stop!

674
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,326
Now what?

675
00:36:21,327 --> 00:36:24,162
Kilwillie,
I challenge you to combat

676
00:36:24,163 --> 00:36:25,864
For the ring
of my forefathers.

677
00:36:25,865 --> 00:36:28,433
You don't need the swords.
I've made the challenge already.

678
00:36:28,434 --> 00:36:31,136
- We're racing for the ring.
- Oh. Why didn't you say so?

679
00:36:31,137 --> 00:36:33,972
<i>- Move over, Duncan.
- What?</i>

680
00:36:33,973 --> 00:36:35,807
Take those, will you?

681
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:38,910
Archie, as Laird,

682
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:41,779
It is your privilege to choose
your comrade in oars.

683
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,955
You can all row together,
for all I care. Roger!

684
00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:57,795
Hector:
Good god!

685
00:36:57,796 --> 00:37:01,266
There's nothing in the rules
against it. Is there, Golly?

686
00:37:06,506 --> 00:37:08,507
It's a stealth boat.

687
00:37:12,311 --> 00:37:14,579
That man is unbelievable!

688
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,947
Right, that does it.

689
00:37:15,948 --> 00:37:17,615
Do you know
where he picks up

690
00:37:17,616 --> 00:37:19,418
The so-called maidens?
691
00:37:19,419 --> 00:37:21,986
I think so.
Why?

692
00:37:21,987 --> 00:37:23,355
First rule
of politics:

693
00:37:23,356 --> 00:37:25,757
Do it to them before
they do it to you.

694
00:37:25,758 --> 00:37:27,159
Come on.

695
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:36,201
Right. The maidens are on
the other side of the loch.

696
00:37:36,202 --> 00:37:38,770
The Laird must accompany
the maiden back,

697
00:37:38,771 --> 00:37:40,505
And the first team
to take their seats

698
00:37:40,506 --> 00:37:42,274
Is the winner.

699
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:44,109
Are our warriors ready?

700
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,877
Oh, get on with it.

701
00:37:45,878 --> 00:37:47,145
On your marks...

702
00:37:47,146 --> 00:37:48,913
Get set...

703
00:37:57,557 --> 00:37:59,558
Oh, they must have been
practicing all year.

704
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:03,161
Stroke.

705
00:38:03,162 --> 00:38:05,163
We've got no chance.

706
00:38:10,536 --> 00:38:12,270
It just doesn't
seem right.

707
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:14,772
Look, you don't want
Kilwillie to win, do you?

708
00:38:18,478 --> 00:38:20,745
Archie's really cute,
isn't he?

709
00:38:20,746 --> 00:38:22,280
Is he?

710
00:38:26,486 --> 00:38:28,086
You're finished,
MacDonald!

711
00:38:28,087 --> 00:38:29,721
You're past it!

712
00:38:29,722 --> 00:38:31,423
I want that ring,
Kilwillie!

713
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,464
It's no good.

714
00:38:39,465 --> 00:38:41,899
<i>Nil desperandum!</i>

715
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,102
( camera clicking )

716
00:38:45,271 --> 00:38:46,605
Well?

717
00:38:46,606 --> 00:38:48,607
Kilwillie's walking it.

718
00:38:52,311 --> 00:38:54,346
Look...

719
00:38:54,347 --> 00:38:56,481
This Gavin...
You do know that he's-

720
00:38:56,482 --> 00:38:58,550
Lexie,

721
00:38:58,551 --> 00:39:00,619
I didn't
really know it...

722
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,888
But I've been waiting for
someone like Gavin all my life.

723
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:06,991
And I'm really looking forward
to living in a big city.

724
00:39:06,992 --> 00:39:08,760
Duncan,
you'll hate Glasgow.

725
00:39:08,761 --> 00:39:10,728
It's full of scary
and selfish people,

726
00:39:10,729 --> 00:39:12,497
And that's
just my family.

727
00:39:12,498 --> 00:39:14,499
Just because you
couldn't take the pace

728
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,434
Doesn't mean to say
that I won't.

729
00:39:16,435 --> 00:39:18,703
Anyway, Gavin will be
there to see me through.

730
00:39:19,805 --> 00:39:22,574
You've made up
your mind then?

731
00:39:22,575 --> 00:39:25,610
- Nothing to keep me here.
- Of course there is.

732
00:39:25,611 --> 00:39:27,512
Nobody
wants you to go.

733
00:39:30,249 --> 00:39:32,384
I don't want you to go.

734
00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:34,252
There.

735
00:39:34,253 --> 00:39:35,554
I said it.

736
00:39:43,762 --> 00:39:46,030
Are you sure
this is going to work?

737
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:48,833
Look, we're just going
for a walk in the woods.

738
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:51,603
He doesn't have to stop and chat
if he doesn't want to.

739
00:39:58,777 --> 00:40:01,513
<i>Flora: Daddy!</i>

740
00:40:01,514 --> 00:40:03,715
<i>Molly: Archie?</i>

741
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:06,884
Archie-ee-ee!

742
00:40:09,188 --> 00:40:11,789
<i>- Daddy!
- I'm coming, flora!</i>

743
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,492
<i>Woman spookily:
Kilwillie...</i>

744
00:40:14,493 --> 00:40:16,928
<i>Woman 2 eerily:
Loch Nacree, Kilwillie...</i>

745
00:40:26,572 --> 00:40:29,441
<i>- Right, that's it.
- Flora: Roger, I'm here!</i>

746
00:40:29,442 --> 00:40:32,611
Come and take me now,
Roger! Ha ha!

747
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:35,213
Steady on, dear,
it's only pretend.

748
00:40:35,214 --> 00:40:37,849
Oh good- Roger!

749
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,752
- Where's daddy?
- Come on.

750
00:40:40,753 --> 00:40:42,754
Whoa!
( laughing )

751
00:40:42,755 --> 00:40:44,021
Roger!

752
00:40:44,022 --> 00:40:45,724
Come on, Roger!

753
00:40:45,725 --> 00:40:48,893
( giggling )

754
00:40:48,894 --> 00:40:51,529
Aw- come on!

755
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,065
( calling softly )
Kilwillie...

756
00:40:54,066 --> 00:40:56,000
Loch Nacree...

757
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:58,102
<i>Kilwillie...</i>

758
00:40:58,103 --> 00:41:02,006
<i>- Kilwillie...
- Remember Loch Nacree...</i>

759
00:41:02,007 --> 00:41:04,008
<i>- Stop!
- Kilwillie...</i>

760
00:41:04,009 --> 00:41:08,780
<i>- Who are you?
- Loch Nacree...</i>

761
00:41:08,781 --> 00:41:11,283
Where-
where are you?!

762
00:41:11,284 --> 00:41:12,417
Mother.

763
00:41:13,886 --> 00:41:16,321
Hector, what
are you doing here?

764
00:41:16,322 --> 00:41:18,356
No time for conversation,
woman. Come on.

765
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:22,560
Tell us about the lady
from Loch Nacree...

766
00:41:22,561 --> 00:41:24,195
Who are you?

767
00:41:24,196 --> 00:41:25,830
<i>Loch Nacree...</i>

768
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:27,865
And what about
Loch Nacree?

769
00:41:27,866 --> 00:41:30,935
I haven't seen that girl
for years!

770
00:41:30,936 --> 00:41:33,204
It was all lies anyway!

771
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,807
Daddy!

772
00:41:35,808 --> 00:41:38,176
<i>( echoing )
Loch... Loch... Loch...</i>

773
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:40,712
<i>( echo continues )</i>

774
00:41:48,354 --> 00:41:50,054
Daddy!

775
00:41:50,055 --> 00:41:51,923
They've caught up!

776
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:56,127
We're going to lose!

777
00:41:58,497 --> 00:42:00,298
Come on, Archie.
Come on.

778
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:03,000
MacDonald! I don't know
what's going on here!

779
00:42:03,001 --> 00:42:05,903
Just- get in,
will you?!

780
00:42:05,904 --> 00:42:06,971
Move!

781
00:42:10,543 --> 00:42:13,878
Get a move on, Archie.
They're not far behind.

782
00:42:26,024 --> 00:42:28,860
<i>Golly: I don't believe
it. We're winning.</i>

783
00:42:28,861 --> 00:42:31,529
- Roger's catching up fast.
- Come on!

784
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,331
<i>Lexie:
Come on, Archie!</i>

785
00:42:33,332 --> 00:42:36,167
Hector: Come on, Archie.
For the ring. For the ring!

786
00:42:36,168 --> 00:42:38,403
- Come on, Roger! Get a move on!
- Faster!

787
00:42:40,406 --> 00:42:42,106
Oh, put your back
into it, man!

788
00:42:47,446 --> 00:42:49,848
<i>- Flora: Roger, come on!
- Lexie: Come on, Archie, row.</i>

789
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:51,783
- Come on, come on!
- Come on, Archie!

790
00:42:53,452 --> 00:42:54,919
- Stroke!
- Behind!

791
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,087
Come on, boys!

792
00:42:56,088 --> 00:42:58,155
Katrina: Come on.

793
00:42:58,156 --> 00:42:59,991
Lexie: Oh, Archie, go on, hurry up.

794
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:01,593
Oh, you can do it!

795
00:43:04,096 --> 00:43:06,464
Show some muscle!
Move it!

796
00:43:06,465 --> 00:43:07,599
Stroke!

797
00:43:09,134 --> 00:43:11,369
<i>- ( cheering )
- come on, Archie!</i>

798
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:25,850
I am so proud of you.

799
00:43:25,851 --> 00:43:27,318
Well done, arch!

800
00:43:30,022 --> 00:43:31,322
( laughing )

801
00:43:31,323 --> 00:43:32,891
Well done, Archie.

802
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,263
Lexie:
Oh, Duncan!

803
00:43:45,137 --> 00:43:46,571
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

804
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:51,876
Oh, darling.

805
00:43:54,413 --> 00:43:55,580
Thank you.

806
00:44:07,526 --> 00:44:09,861
Hector: Disembodied voices
in the wood, you say?

807
00:44:09,862 --> 00:44:11,796
Quite right.
They were all over the place.

808
00:44:11,797 --> 00:44:13,798
What were
they saying?

809
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:15,834
I couldn't quite
make it out.

810
00:44:17,269 --> 00:44:19,871
It was a...
Was a damn strange affair.

811
00:44:19,872 --> 00:44:21,873
<i>Hector: There'll be a
rational explanation.</i>

812
00:44:21,874 --> 00:44:23,842
'course there will.
We all thought

813
00:44:23,843 --> 00:44:26,077
That Red Bonnet
had brought us a fish

814
00:44:26,078 --> 00:44:29,180
Until we discovered that Hector
had been off night fishing.

815
00:44:29,181 --> 00:44:31,048
Didn't catch a damn thing
all week though.

816
00:44:31,049 --> 00:44:33,117
Well then, who
did bring the fish?

817
00:44:35,253 --> 00:44:37,655
Ah, well, you see,
there's no accounting

818
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:39,557
For the ways
of the other world.

819
00:44:43,228 --> 00:44:46,631
Slainte.

820
00:44:49,568 --> 00:44:51,168
You were right.

821
00:44:51,169 --> 00:44:52,971
She's gutted at the thought
of me going.

822
00:44:52,972 --> 00:44:55,072
She's crazy
about you, man.

823
00:44:55,073 --> 00:44:57,542
A bit of unfair,
kidding around that-

824
00:44:57,543 --> 00:44:59,343
You and me were...

825
00:45:00,445 --> 00:45:02,246
Well, you know.

826
00:45:02,247 --> 00:45:05,817
What, after she tried
to set you up last night?

827
00:45:05,818 --> 00:45:07,752
You're too good
for her.

828
00:45:11,156 --> 00:45:13,457
I still think you could
make a go of it in Glasgow.

829
00:45:15,761 --> 00:45:18,129
They do have women
there too, you know.

830
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,801
<i>Aye, but I
couldn't leave here</i>

831
00:45:23,802 --> 00:45:26,004
<i>Knowing how much
Lexie needs me.</i>

832
00:45:26,005 --> 00:45:28,439
<i>She'd be lost
without me.</i>

833
00:45:30,576 --> 00:45:32,610
All right, Lex?

834
00:45:32,611 --> 00:45:35,713
Don't "all right" me! I've
been listening to you two.

835
00:45:35,714 --> 00:45:38,783
- Oh dear.
- You sneaky little-

836
00:45:38,784 --> 00:45:40,484
You can talk.

837
00:45:40,485 --> 00:45:43,521
"they love eye contact. "
you didn't tell me why.

838
00:45:43,522 --> 00:45:45,557
Well, you can
run off to Glasgow

839
00:45:45,558 --> 00:45:47,025
For all I care.

840
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,427
What you asked me
yesterday

841
00:45:49,428 --> 00:45:51,996
About whether I'll be
staying around much longer...

842
00:45:51,997 --> 00:45:54,298
- Duncan: It's your fault, Lexie!
- The truth is I don't know.

843
00:45:54,299 --> 00:45:56,267
- Duncan: You bet I can!
- Lexie: I'll catch you!

844
00:45:56,268 --> 00:45:57,969
Right.

845
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:02,173
The thing is, I'm no longer
absolutely sure that I won't be either.

846
00:46:02,174 --> 00:46:06,277
This place, it gets
under your skin.

847
00:46:06,278 --> 00:46:08,880
Well, it's always
been under mine.

848
00:46:08,881 --> 00:46:10,782
That's why
I want to do

849
00:46:10,783 --> 00:46:12,617
What I can
for the place.

850
00:46:12,618 --> 00:46:15,553
Give something back,
you know?

851
00:46:15,554 --> 00:46:17,421
That's what
my manifesto's about.

852
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:26,664
"by far the most
compelling reason

853
00:46:26,665 --> 00:46:29,400
For transferring the estate
to the control of the tenants

854
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:32,236
Is the damage that has accrued
to the land and resources

855
00:46:32,237 --> 00:46:34,606
Due to years of exploitation
and incompetence

856
00:46:34,607 --> 00:46:37,274
- by the incumbent family. "
- Fiona wrote that bit.

857
00:46:37,275 --> 00:46:39,210
Yeah, but you think it,
don't you?

858
00:46:39,211 --> 00:46:41,713
- You know it's true.
- Do I indeed?

859
00:46:41,714 --> 00:46:43,781
You said so yourself.

860
00:46:43,782 --> 00:46:46,417
This place has been run
into the ground.

861
00:46:46,418 --> 00:46:49,087
Oh, and you're gonna save
it single-handed, are you?

862
00:46:49,088 --> 00:46:51,355
If that's
what it takes, yes.

863
00:46:51,356 --> 00:46:53,491
Oh, I just can't
believe you've done this!

864
00:46:53,492 --> 00:46:55,793
<i>- I haven't done anything.
- Working together, you said.</i>

865
00:46:55,794 --> 00:46:58,229
<i>And so that means
