1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,936
Archie: This ball is going to
be the biggest day of the year.

2
00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:16,605
Lascelles are bringing
some major investors here

3
00:00:16,606 --> 00:00:19,441
to show them how they've
turned the place around.

4
00:00:19,442 --> 00:00:21,410
How we've
turned it around.

5
00:00:21,411 --> 00:00:24,346
Duncan, you'll organize
the parking.

6
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:26,982
Golly, the Americans
love the pipes.

7
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:28,717
Molly, our foreign
visitors

8
00:00:28,718 --> 00:00:30,953
are expecting something
between the Queen

9
00:00:30,954 --> 00:00:33,889
- and the brunette in "Braveheart. "
- Leave it to me.

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,491
Archie and I will be front
of house pressing the flesh.

11
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:38,327
<i>Oh, Lexie.</i>

12
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:41,063
- You're in the kitchen.
- Surprise, surprise.

13
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:43,398
<i>Archie: Now the next
three days are going to be</i>

14
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,434
the most seamless,
well-oiled

15
00:00:45,435 --> 00:00:48,503
and least accident-prone
in the history of Glenbogle.

16
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:50,940
If we pull together,
Lascelles could get

17
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,275
some really good P.R.,
and we can have a good time.

18
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:55,244
- Could you list my duties?
- Yes, father.

19
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:57,446
The stone ceremony.
Concentrate on that.

20
00:00:57,447 --> 00:01:00,649
It's what everyone's coming
to see and it's in your hands.

21
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,385
You can
count on me.

22
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:05,855
Why does that have a
slightly hollow ring to it?

23
00:01:08,524 --> 00:01:10,893
<i>( theme music plays )</i>

24
00:01:45,762 --> 00:01:48,764
Stone of the MacDonalds? I
thought that was just a legend.

25
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:51,100
An ancient symbol
of MacDonald power.

26
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:53,568
It was carried into
battle at Bannockburn,

27
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:58,240
Midsummer's Day, 1314. When
we sent the English packing.

28
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:02,211
Not before the stone was cloven
in three by an English ax.

29
00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:03,712
Oh, I say,
bad luck.

30
00:02:03,713 --> 00:02:07,349
At Midsummer Ball, the three
fragments must be joined.

31
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,184
About the ball...

32
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:13,289
the Glenbogle
fragment.

33
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,757
- You've got one?
- The largest, naturally.

34
00:02:15,758 --> 00:02:18,360
You sure it's quite safe
to keep it in a cake tin?

35
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:20,896
My dear Kilwillie,
I guard this with my life.

36
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:23,565
If lost, my family name
is blackened forever.

37
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:25,334
Jolly serious.

38
00:02:26,436 --> 00:02:29,305
As is the guest list,
I hear.

39
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:31,540
Captains of industry?

40
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:35,144
Captains? generals.
They're sending generals.

41
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:37,746
My invitation seems
to have gone astray.

42
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:40,782
Generals of industry and
MacDonalds only, I'm afraid.

43
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:44,086
I, Kilwillie, shunned?

44
00:02:44,087 --> 00:02:47,689
My dear Kilwillie, the bank
is lavishing money on Glenbogle

45
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,993
because it wishes to bask in
our ancient ties and traditions.

46
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:53,996
I suggest you organize
some of your own

47
00:02:53,997 --> 00:02:57,933
should you require access
to the upper echelons.

48
00:02:57,934 --> 00:02:59,568
Good day to you.

49
00:03:02,238 --> 00:03:04,739
It's been 10 years since
the last Midsummer Ball,

50
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,809
and guess what?
Lexie is in the kitchen.

51
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,345
And I'm probably
expected.

52
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:11,680
We've 20 of Lascelles'
top clients

53
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:14,249
and 40 MacDonalds to feed.
I need you here.

54
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,519
And you think he needs
you at the ball?

55
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,556
This is our night.
Mine and Archie's.

56
00:03:21,557 --> 00:03:24,559
You'll do a wonderful
job down here.

57
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,228
True.

58
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:29,198
I suppose he'll be more impressed
by the food on the table,

59
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,866
than the tart
on this arm.

60
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:34,003
I don't see him bursting a
blood vessel to get you invited.

61
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:36,405
You are going because
the bank is paying you.

62
00:03:36,406 --> 00:03:39,008
You don't think he
wants you there, do you?

63
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,876
And he wants you here
out of his way.

64
00:03:40,877 --> 00:03:42,344
Out of whose way?

65
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:43,879
You better
watch her, Arch.

66
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,882
She's trying to get her
claws into you for the ball.

67
00:03:46,883 --> 00:03:48,917
<i>Tell her she's
just a bank manager.</i>

68
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:51,786
- That's not entirely true,
- don't be hard on her.

69
00:03:51,787 --> 00:03:55,090
She's hoping you'll waft her
out of here on a white charger.

70
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:58,260
Tell her she's just
a housekeeper.

71
00:03:58,261 --> 00:04:00,595
I'd never say that.

72
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:03,298
<i>I'm flattered to have
cropped up in conversation,</i>

73
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,534
<i>but we have to work
together, remember?</i>

74
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:08,737
For the bank, for the estate.
So cease fire?

75
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:10,705
Of course, Archie.
Fine by me.

76
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:13,942
Aye.

77
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:23,318
I can't stand
around here having fun.

78
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,787
My ball gown
is arriving this morning.

79
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:28,123
Well, make sure you
enjoy your night of glory.

80
00:04:28,124 --> 00:04:31,693
Archie and me will still be here
when you'll just be a bad memory.

81
00:04:31,694 --> 00:04:33,062
( door slams )

82
00:04:47,877 --> 00:04:49,911
Stella,
good to see you.

83
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:52,314
Archie MacDonald,
Laird of Glenbogle.

84
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:55,417
Toby Winslow, head of
corporate affairs, Lascelles.

85
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:57,752
You know what we've got
riding on this event?

86
00:04:57,753 --> 00:04:59,654
Yes, you're planning
a big expansion

87
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:01,756
into leisure finance
and management.

88
00:05:01,757 --> 00:05:05,794
Worldwide. From this little
acorn a mighty oak will grow.

89
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:08,397
- The chairman not with you?
- His flight's delayed.

90
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:11,133
The old boy usually swans
in to take the plaudits.

91
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:12,934
<i>It is his train set,
after all.</i>

92
00:05:12,935 --> 00:05:16,271
He's planning to hand the
estate back to you, Archie.

93
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:18,273
<i>- at the ball.
- What?</i>

94
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:21,143
- That's fantastic.
- I did say planning.

95
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:24,580
<i>His changes of heart are
legendary. You've been warned.</i>

96
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:25,914
Stella?

97
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:35,023
Looks like it's just
you and me now. Eh, boss?

98
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,368
Golly:
Archie. Archie.

99
00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:46,803
It's about the music
for the ball.

100
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:51,275
- A band from Inverness. - The Bogle Boys
will be mightily disappointed.

101
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:54,778
They played at the last ball.
You probably wouldn't remember.

102
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:56,346
Yes, of course.
The Bogle Boys.

103
00:05:56,347 --> 00:05:58,915
Voted the best band in the
glen four years running.

104
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,551
Even cut a waxing,
I believe.

105
00:06:00,552 --> 00:06:03,320
The Inverness lot
come highly recommended.

106
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,890
They're brilliant,
but they're not your people.

107
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:08,392
The Bogle Boys are.

108
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:11,461
Look, Golly,

109
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:14,598
I know the laird
has responsibilities,

110
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:16,667
but isn't this
going a bit far?

111
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,803
There's 39,000 acres and all
the folk that live on them,

112
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:21,905
that's how far it goes.

113
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,878
<i>Winslow:
300 grand.</i>

114
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,147
Double it
with bonuses.

115
00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:34,251
And your own empire
to build.

116
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:39,489
This is a huge step.

117
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,157
<i>You won't be wasting
your talents</i>

118
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:43,227
on the Archie MacDonalds
of this world.

119
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:44,861
Big league, Stella.

120
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,996
Do I get time
to think about it?

121
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:49,299
Straight after the ball,
you're out of here.

122
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,336
A couple of days and you're on
a plane to meet your new team.

123
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,041
- Toby, I-
- your star is rising.

124
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,710
As I always said
it would be.

125
00:07:01,912 --> 00:07:04,281
I hope that nothing
goes wrong.

126
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:08,151
I mean, I'd hate to be stuck
here for another six months.

127
00:07:08,152 --> 00:07:10,887
Oh, don't worry. Things
would have to go badly wrong

128
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,789
for me to leave you
at Glenbogle.

129
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:23,600
How badly exactly?

130
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:30,940
Boys.

131
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:34,778
This is Archie MacDonald
from the big house.

132
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:36,880
Archie, this
is Graeme.

133
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:38,649
<i>This is his
kid brother, lain,</i>

134
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,717
<i>and that's
young Alistair.</i>

135
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:43,186
Gents, how would you
like to perform again?

136
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:47,190
We've got the Midsummer Ball coming
up and we'd like you to play at it.

137
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:53,397
I'll no more play
for that family

138
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:56,199
than fly to the moon.

139
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:02,539
Aye. your father laid him
off like the rest of us.

140
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,873
But Graeme's
a proud man.

141
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,676
<i>Knocked the stuffing
out of him.</i>

142
00:08:05,677 --> 00:08:07,844
Hasn't had the heart
to play a note since.

143
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,330
Well done, Duncan.

144
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:28,432
Well, we want
to impress him, right?

145
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:30,667
This chairman,
lord what's-his-name?

146
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:32,936
Cranthorne, yes.

147
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:39,943
You collect him, Duncan,
in the Land Rover.

148
00:08:39,944 --> 00:08:41,411
What?

149
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:44,113
And come back
the scenic route.

150
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:47,384
<i>He'll like that.</i>

151
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,455
I haven't come
to fight.

152
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:54,257
Well, don't go against
ritual on my account.

153
00:08:54,258 --> 00:08:57,361
Dinner tonight
for Lord Cranthorne.

154
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:59,663
Wild salmon with
all the trimmings.

155
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,964
Smoked duck to start.

156
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:02,999
That sounds
wonderful.

157
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,434
But...?

158
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:07,504
Lord Cranthorne.
He's a bit of an oddball.

159
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,039
<i>When he's
in Scotland...</i>

160
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,375
go on.

161
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:14,911
He makes a big point
about a simple supper.

162
00:09:14,912 --> 00:09:18,682
Bit of old scrag end,
a few turnips.

163
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,584
Crofter's stew?

164
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:22,185
Yeah, terrible
if you ask me.

165
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,489
Well, I'm cooking for Lord
Cranthorne, my girl, not you.

166
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,293
And what
the man wants,

167
00:09:32,463 --> 00:09:34,798
the man gets.

168
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,833
I take it
you knew about that.

169
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:38,602
I can't lie
to you, Archie,

170
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:41,971
but people like Graeme used to
be proud to live in this glen.

171
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:44,775
They will be again once the
estate is back on its feet.

172
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:48,011
You can't restore a man's pride
by showing him the bottom line.

173
00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:49,713
That's what the bank
wants to see.

174
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,716
There are better judges of
a man than the moneylenders.

175
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,350
Like Graeme?

176
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:56,453
Oh, look, Archie.
You asked me

177
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:59,589
if I thought you could run
the estate and I said yes.

178
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,959
You never asked if I thought
you could be laird of Glenbogle.

179
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,961
And?

180
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:07,196
You've got a wee bit
to go yet, son.

181
00:10:19,477 --> 00:10:20,944
Duncan!

182
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:27,984
Here's Lord Cranthorne now.
His family were at Bannockburn.

183
00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:29,486
What?

184
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:34,691
On the other side, obviously.
But it's such a long time ago.

185
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:36,593
In the history
of the MacDonalds

186
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,361
the merest blinking
of an eye.

187
00:10:39,964 --> 00:10:42,532
Just a little
high spirits.

188
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:43,934
Not one step further.

189
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,603
- This is Lord Cranthorne.
- Of Bannockburn infamy.

190
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,438
- Who's this lunatic?
- The father.

191
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,539
Oh, god.

192
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,909
Midsummer Day, 1314.
Ring any bells?

193
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,144
Perhaps you two
could catch up inside.

194
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:57,614
<i>- You shall not pass!
- Archie: father! father!</i>

195
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,216
Come, Cranthorne,
let's grapple hand-to-hand,

196
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:02,652
as our forefathers did
in that bloody field.

197
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:04,754
The truth is,
the Cranthorne family

198
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:07,724
were more into catering
at that particular skirmish.

199
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:09,125
Catering?

200
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,193
Ha!

201
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:14,898
Archie MacDonald,
Lord Cranthorne.

202
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:16,466
I apologize
for my father.

203
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,335
Mr. MacDonald, you're part
of a great tradition.

204
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:22,138
<i>Turn it to profit,
not doorstep confrontation.</i>

205
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,508
Toby.

206
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:33,650
Catering.

207
00:11:51,435 --> 00:11:54,203
Stella: This is a wooden
copy of the Glenbogle stone.

208
00:11:54,204 --> 00:11:56,272
Yeah, most of this stuff's locally made.

209
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:59,576
Comes cheaper from Taiwan.
Who'd know the difference?

210
00:11:59,577 --> 00:12:01,678
Well, Archie's loyal
to the local people.

211
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,214
Narrower margins, but the
local economy benefits.

212
00:12:05,215 --> 00:12:07,751
I can't recall agreeing to the financing

213
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:09,452
of the whole
of highlands.

214
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:10,620
My lord?

215
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:15,491
Archie?

216
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:19,930
You've cleared my things
off the billiard table.

217
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:23,600
- I thought our guests might like a game.
- I might have been consulted.

218
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:27,236
You weren't around. There wasn't
anything important, was there?

219
00:12:27,237 --> 00:12:29,338
No. no. Where did you put it all?

220
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,641
I told Duncan to put it
in the back cellar.

221
00:12:31,642 --> 00:12:33,677
Ah, the back cellar.

222
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:02,572
So Lascelles give the keys
to Arch, and Stella's gone.

223
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,775
- You sure?
- Hm-mm.

224
00:13:05,776 --> 00:13:08,544
After the ball is over,
you, sister,

225
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:10,747
are up, up,
up and away.

226
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:15,551
Alexandra.

227
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:20,256
Duncan,
you removed

228
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,559
certain personal effects
of mine to storage.

229
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,097
Ah, the train set. aye.
It's in the back cellar.

230
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,032
Not quite.

231
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:32,669
You will recall
a Dundee cake tin?

232
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,304
Where are
the contents, lad?

233
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:38,374
- I didn't eat it.
- Of course you didn't eat it.

234
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,511
It's got raisins in it.
I don't like.

235
00:13:41,512 --> 00:13:45,414
- They get stuck in your teeth.
- Don't play the slippery eel with me.

236
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:48,584
- Maybe I had a wee peek.
- Where did you put it?

237
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:51,054
- There was nothing in it.
- Duncan...

238
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:55,191
I swear to you, boss,
it was empty.

239
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:56,893
<i>Archie:
Yes, it's tragic, really.</i>

240
00:13:56,894 --> 00:13:59,763
They were one of the best bands
in the highlands in their day.

241
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:01,831
You can't cling
to the past.

242
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:04,901
No, no, of course. But
I still feel responsible.

243
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:06,936
Your responsibilities
are to the bank.

244
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:10,506
500,000 of them
at the last count.

245
00:14:10,507 --> 00:14:12,308
You're not going
to go soft on us?

246
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,078
- No.
- ( bagpipe playing )

247
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:27,490
Molly:
What's this, Lexie?

248
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:31,761
Crofter's stew.

249
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:35,198
Scrag end.

250
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:38,634
<i>Here we are.</i>

251
00:14:38,635 --> 00:14:41,470
Mutton, neeps,

252
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:43,372
and tatties-

253
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:47,410
a simple highland supper.

254
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:50,379
How... very authentic.

255
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,250
Oh, thank you,
your lordship. enjoy.

256
00:14:54,251 --> 00:14:55,852
( low groan )

257
00:15:01,225 --> 00:15:03,159
Cranthorne: I don't know what that was.

258
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,994
I doubt his mother
knew, either.

259
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:07,964
I take it you've hired
a real chef for the ball?

260
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:11,467
- Archie: Er, no.
- I suggest you do.

261
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:13,737
- I can't do that.
- Oh, nonsense.

262
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:17,006
I've hired and fired more
chefs than I've had hot dinners.

263
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:19,475
Almost as many,
come to think of it.

264
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:23,880
It's no big deal, Archie.
The bank's paying.

265
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,816
It's not the money, it's
Lexie. She'll be mortified.

266
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:29,886
I admire loyalty, but
Cranthorne has spoken.

267
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,021
You want the keys back?
Do as he says.

268
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,960
If Archie finds out
I've lost it, oh, Molly-

269
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:38,694
if I don't produce it
at the ball,

270
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:41,798
our boy will be deposed as
head of the clan. The shame.

271
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,532
Oh, come on. think.

272
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:46,870
I'm sure I put it back in the
tin when that ass Kilwillie went.

273
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:50,373
Oh, don't tell me that you two
have been falling out again.

274
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:52,942
He was begging me for an
invitation to the ball.

275
00:15:52,943 --> 00:15:54,744
I told him it was
rather exclusive.

276
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:58,547
- And then he left?
- No, damn it, I left-

277
00:15:58,548 --> 00:15:59,983
I left.

278
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:03,419
I left Kilwillie alone
with the Glenbogle fragment.

279
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,221
Molly, you're a genius.

280
00:16:05,222 --> 00:16:07,056
But how can we
get him to confess?

281
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:09,092
Leave it to me.
I'll make him squeal.

282
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,595
We'll be "mutt and Jeff. "
"Good cop, bad cop" to you.

283
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:16,199
Splendid, woman. We'll collar
the rotter tomorrow. yes!

284
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,802
Hector? Molly?

285
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:21,137
Now squeal, Kilwillie.
Or I'll put the arm on.

286
00:16:21,138 --> 00:16:23,139
We're only here
to help you, old man.

287
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,708
What's the matter
with you both?

288
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:27,977
Nice place you've
got here, Kilwillie.

289
00:16:27,978 --> 00:16:30,579
Yes, shame if it
was smashed up.

290
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,748
- Now steady on-!
- 'Fess up, Kilwillie,

291
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:35,185
unless you'd rather bat
the blab with the pigs.

292
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:37,153
Is this some sort
of Esperanto?

293
00:16:37,154 --> 00:16:41,324
- What have you done with it?
- Oh, all right. I did take it.

294
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:43,226
But Hector was
damnably rude to me.

295
00:16:43,227 --> 00:16:45,428
Oh, save it
for the social worker.

296
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:48,631
Hector, if you were rude
you must say, "sorry. "

297
00:16:50,034 --> 00:16:52,035
- ( mumbling ) sorry.
- Speak up, dear.

298
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:55,939
- Sorry. now I will use my
considerable influence- - Hector!

299
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,942
- I'll get you an invitation.
- Well, then...

300
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:02,411
to Glenbogle, friends,
where the ancient fragment

301
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:04,180
rests in complete
security.

302
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:07,750
- I sincerely hope so.
- It's better than a Dundee cake tin, Hector.

303
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:14,123
I thought it went well last
night. Lord Cranthorne's right.

304
00:17:14,124 --> 00:17:18,261
It's nice to have something
authentic for a wee change.

305
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:20,796
It was certainly
a change, Lex.

306
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:22,598
So have you come
to help me dry up?

307
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:25,134
No, it's about
the ball, actually.

308
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:27,803
I've decided
to hire a chef.

309
00:17:31,075 --> 00:17:32,976
- You said-
- I know what I said.

310
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:35,511
- I was the only one you could trust.
- And I meant it.

311
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,214
- "I depend on you, Lexie. "
- I do, I do.

312
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:40,250
So now you drop me
like a dirty rag?

313
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:43,920
I did it so you could
come to the ball, Lex.

314
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,893
Oh, Arch...
you're such a sweet man.

315
00:17:59,236 --> 00:18:00,937
- Come in.
- Morning.

316
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,176
Now...

317
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:09,545
<i>drama schools,
draft proofing...</i>

318
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,180
ah- dress hire.

319
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:13,582
Should I be
curious?

320
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,984
I shall go
to the ball.

321
00:18:14,985 --> 00:18:17,620
You're going to a lot
of trouble for nothing.

322
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:20,390
So are you. Going as
a packet of wine gums?

323
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:24,193
I'm going as
Archie's partner.

324
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:27,330
<i>- Who's cooking?
- Ask your partner.</i>

325
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:29,165
He fixed it for me.

326
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:43,246
Penny for them.

327
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:47,083
That is a derisory offer,
Stella Moon, and you know it.

328
00:18:49,886 --> 00:18:52,655
I gather Lexie isn't
cooking for the ball.

329
00:18:52,656 --> 00:18:54,857
Any special reason?

330
00:18:54,858 --> 00:18:58,328
Yes. Cranthorne took
against her crofter's stew,

331
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:00,830
but I thought it best
not to mention that.

332
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:04,800
Oh. your management skills
are improving.

333
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,674
- Problem?
- Finding a chef.

334
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:24,753
"Jeff Ramsden. "
Any good?

335
00:19:24,754 --> 00:19:29,025
Yeah. and at a loose end
as far as I know.

336
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,265
I saw it
in a cinema film.

337
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:38,134
A burglar
placed his swag

338
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,769
in the lavatory system
for later collection.

339
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,271
Get on with it.

340
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:45,208
Any more of that, you can fish
the bally thing out yourself.

341
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:49,545
It's been removed.

342
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:51,580
The fragment
isn't there.

343
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:53,416
What?

344
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:56,185
I swear to you, I put it
there myself yesterday morning.

345
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:57,620
But now it's gone.

346
00:19:57,621 --> 00:19:59,655
Ooh-hh...

347
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:09,499
I'm guessing
it's some years

348
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,035
since a MacDonald
last knocked on your door.

349
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:13,903
It's a few.

350
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:20,943
We were loggers-

351
00:20:20,944 --> 00:20:25,148
myself, brother lain,
young Alistair.

352
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:28,184
30 years we tended
these forests.

353
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:32,221
10 years ago your father
laid us off.

354
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:34,590
Truth to tell, it was
at the Midsummer Ball.

355
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:37,860
- His timing isn't perfect.
- We played,

356
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,996
whilst the nobs danced
and cavorted before us.

357
00:20:40,997 --> 00:20:43,799
Dancing this fine estate
into oblivion

358
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,769
with great grins
on their faces.

359
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,838
Look, Graeme,
I can't help the past,

360
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,340
<i>but I'm running it now.</i>

361
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:53,376
The estate's back
on its feet.

362
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,412
It staggers a bit from time
to time, but it's working.

363
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:58,548
<i>And I want you
to feel part of it.</i>

364
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,716
That's a fine
sentiment.

365
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,852
It's more than that, Graeme.
Glenbogle's back,

366
00:21:03,853 --> 00:21:06,055
and it wants to hear
its own music again.

367
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:30,012
Haven't touched this
in 10 years, mate.

368
00:21:32,782 --> 00:21:35,951
Do you want to play?

369
00:21:35,952 --> 00:21:37,920
We'll give it a go.

370
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,730
Before you start,
I'm going,

371
00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:49,898
and there's nothing
you can do to stop me.

372
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:51,934
Can we talk normally
for once?

373
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,971
Look, I know
you're fond of Archie,

374
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:58,907
and he's lucky
to have you.

375
00:21:58,908 --> 00:22:00,743
As his housekeeper,
no doubt?

376
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:03,312
Whereas you've got
the great business mind.

377
00:22:03,313 --> 00:22:06,415
You say the right things, hang
about with all the right people.

378
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,818
You think Archie's just some
tasty lad from down the street?

379
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:13,756
He's the laird of Glenbogle.
How could you live up to that?

380
00:22:13,757 --> 00:22:15,991
<i>- I love him.
- that's not hard.</i>

381
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:17,560
The rest is.

382
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:20,196
<i>Keep what you've got
with Archie right now-</i>

383
00:22:20,197 --> 00:22:23,199
his affection and respect-

384
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,968
but don't dream
of anything more.

385
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:29,138
Well, he fixed it for me
to go to the ball.

386
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,175
<i>Cranthorne didn't like
your cooking, Lexie.</i>

387
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:35,611
Archie was just trying to
spare your feelings. That's all.

388
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,953
You ready?

389
00:22:44,954 --> 00:22:46,789
I'm not going
to go.

390
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,358
- What she been saying to you?
- Nothing.

391
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,361
That you're just some little
skivvy, and she's what,

392
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:54,930
god's gift
to banking?

393
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:57,833
Well, I thought
you fancied her.

394
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,769
I did.
Oh, come on, Lex.

395
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:04,106
You're worth
10 of her.

396
00:23:04,107 --> 00:23:06,475
Duncan, will I make
a fool of myself?

397
00:23:06,476 --> 00:23:09,245
Dressed like that,
you will.

398
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,558
Ahem...

399
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:27,996
I feel like
a Christmas tree.

400
00:23:27,997 --> 00:23:30,065
Well, say something.

401
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:34,503
Really?

402
00:23:34,504 --> 00:23:36,004
Wow.

403
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:39,808
Can you have a look
at the price tag for me?

404
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:41,210
I can't get at it.

405
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,348
Oh.

406
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:52,154
I wanted to hire the dress,
not buy the shop.

407
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:55,090
Oh, well.
Nice while it lasted.

408
00:24:14,478 --> 00:24:16,879
Don't be such
a fool, girl.

409
00:24:18,882 --> 00:24:20,783
I can't take that.

410
00:24:20,784 --> 00:24:22,818
Yes, you can.

411
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:25,053
- Duncan, that's all-
- take it.

412
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:30,893
Thanks, Dunc.

413
00:24:30,894 --> 00:24:32,762
I owe you one.

414
00:24:36,232 --> 00:24:37,433
<i>Hector:
Duncan!</i>

415
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,336
Have you been messing about
with the thunderbox?

416
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:42,705
Oh, I fixed it
like you said, boss.

417
00:24:42,706 --> 00:24:45,808
- Some loon had put a rock in the system.
- What do you mean, loon?

418
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:48,110
- "Rock"?
- And where would the "rock" be now?

419
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,882
Shouldn't we come back in
the morning when it's open?

420
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:55,685
The future of Glenbogle
is at stake.

421
00:24:55,686 --> 00:24:57,620
We have to get through
this wire now.

422
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,356
But look at me. I can't go
in there in these clothes.

423
00:25:00,357 --> 00:25:02,958
I don't think
there's a dress code.

424
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,760
You boys go in.
I'll keep watch.

425
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:06,228
I'll help Molly.

426
00:25:06,229 --> 00:25:08,597
Where's your sense
of moral fortitude, man?

427
00:25:08,598 --> 00:25:11,166
What is the matter with you?
Get through the hole.

428
00:25:14,604 --> 00:25:16,305
- Hector: Go on.
- Really-!

429
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:19,675
( playing off-key )

430
00:25:21,745 --> 00:25:24,547
Well, you know what they
say about a bad rehearsal.

431
00:25:24,548 --> 00:25:29,218
You've managed to find the musical
equivalent of crofter's stew.

432
00:25:29,219 --> 00:25:30,953
- Authentic?
- Unpalatable.

433
00:25:30,954 --> 00:25:32,655
They haven't
got loose yet.

434
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,990
<i>Oh, yes they have.
I don't know where from.</i>

435
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,727
Wherever it is, send them back
and hire some musicians.

436
00:25:37,728 --> 00:25:39,528
Give them a chance.
I owe these guys.

437
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:41,897
If we're talking what
you owe, Mr. MacDonald,

438
00:25:41,898 --> 00:25:43,666
I think my bank
has precedence

439
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,068
over this bunch
of tuneless amateurs.

440
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:47,870
Fellows, please-!

441
00:25:47,871 --> 00:25:49,938
We'll not embarrass
you further.

442
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:52,375
You bring me in a bone shake
driven by a madman,

443
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:55,010
to be greeted by your father
spoiling for a fight,

444
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,613
<i>you serve a bowl of gristle
swimming in fat,</i>

445
00:25:57,614 --> 00:25:59,482
and now you have
no musicians.

446
00:25:59,483 --> 00:26:01,717
Jeff Ramsden.
Archie, chef.

447
00:26:01,718 --> 00:26:03,786
Am I glad to see you.

448
00:26:03,787 --> 00:26:06,422
- What's he doing here?
- This is Lord Cranthorne.

449
00:26:06,423 --> 00:26:08,290
- I know who he is.
- Have we met?

450
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:11,627
Yeah, just the once. He's fired
more chefs than he's had hot dinners.

451
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:14,196
Did he tell you that?
Proud of it, his lordship.

452
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,798
I'm sure we can
sort this out.

453
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,367
Only one thing to sort out
- who's cooking tomorrow.

454
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,135
- Jeff, please.
- I'm sorry, mate.

455
00:26:20,136 --> 00:26:23,672
I'm not hanging around to get the
push again, not from that creep.

456
00:26:23,673 --> 00:26:26,842
Now you have no chef, either.
Cancel the ball.

457
00:26:32,282 --> 00:26:34,316
<i>Kilwillie: Oh, Hector, I'm so tired.</i>

458
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:35,918
Can't we just
call it a day?

459
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,788
We'll call it no such thing.
I'll leave no stone unturned.

460
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:41,824
<i>- Duncan: got it! -
Don't interrupt. No stone-</i>

461
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,894
got it!

462
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,495
Bravo!

463
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:48,230
Well done!

464
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:54,169
Like so many
of your plans, Hector,

465
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,404
this one was a corker

466
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,173
until the moment
of catastrophic failure.

467
00:26:58,174 --> 00:27:00,042
Oh, shut up.

468
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:03,278
I won't have
Lascelles

469
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,280
associated with
a catastrophe like you.

470
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:07,215
Your guests will already
be on their way.

471
00:27:07,216 --> 00:27:09,652
Tomorrow morning everything
will be ironed out.

472
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:11,454
It'll all be running
like clockwork.

473
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:12,922
If there's
a disaster-

474
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:15,324
there won't be any more
disasters. I promise you.

475
00:27:27,904 --> 00:27:30,606
Merely assisting
in certain inquiries.

476
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:33,175
We picked up these four
at the municipal dump

477
00:27:33,176 --> 00:27:34,910
<i>sorting through
the rubbish.</i>

478
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:36,745
Claim some
connection with you.

479
00:27:36,746 --> 00:27:39,414
Yes, officer.
They're mine.

480
00:27:41,084 --> 00:27:43,953
Try and keep your nose
clean, Lord Cranthorne.

481
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,900
<i>Archie: Lord Cranthorne
seems upset for some reason.</i>

482
00:27:57,901 --> 00:28:00,970
<i>I can't think why.</i>

483
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:04,373
<i>The thing is, tomorrow is one of
the most important days of the year.</i>

484
00:28:04,374 --> 00:28:06,976
<i>And everything is
hanging in rags.</i>

485
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,077
Is there anything
we can do?

486
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:12,548
Well, I wonder,
just for tomorrow,

487
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:16,151
if you could all try to pass
yourself off as normal human beings.

488
00:28:26,563 --> 00:28:28,831
It's not your fault,
you know.

489
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:33,101
No, but it's my
responsibility.

490
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:35,738
I used to think Glenbogle
was my future, you know?

491
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:38,340
- It still is.
- No, no...

492
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:42,377
<i>you see, I am Glenbogle's
future. There's a big difference.</i>

493
00:28:42,378 --> 00:28:46,448
<i>35,000 acres and all
the people on them-</i>

494
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:50,519
I am their future.
I can't even organize a dance.

495
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,155
It's just a setback.

496
00:28:53,156 --> 00:28:56,825
Hm - the Bogle Boys,
they didn't believe in me, either.

497
00:28:56,826 --> 00:29:00,429
I believe in you.

498
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:04,767
But if things do go wrong,
and I have to stay,

499
00:29:04,768 --> 00:29:07,369
would that be the worst
thing in the world?

500
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,672
No, of course not.

501
00:29:09,673 --> 00:29:12,441
But the way things are going,
I wouldn't pack just yet.

502
00:29:18,615 --> 00:29:21,383
<i>- ( knocking )
- Come in.</i>

503
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,287
Hi, Arch.

504
00:29:25,288 --> 00:29:27,389
What's wrong?

505
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,391
Do you not
like it?

506
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,026
No, it's beautiful.

507
00:29:31,027 --> 00:29:34,463
- Then why the long face?
- My new chef's done a bunk.

508
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,701
You cannot
be serious.

509
00:29:38,702 --> 00:29:41,070
Well, who else
can I ask?

510
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:44,239
Good old Lexie,
resident doormat.

511
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,741
Is that how you feel?

512
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,710
One minute I'm going
to the ball,

513
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:50,378
the next minute
I'm stuck in the kitchen.

514
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:53,181
Stella's right.
I'm just the housekeeper.

515
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:55,450
You know I don't
think of you like that.

516
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:58,253
- You don't think of me at all.
- I do.

517
00:29:59,455 --> 00:30:02,758
I do, Lexie. a lot.

518
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,394
Well, you've got a funny way
of showing it, Archie MacDonald.

519
00:30:06,395 --> 00:30:08,664
Just go now, please.

520
00:30:28,918 --> 00:30:31,453
The Glenbogle fragment

521
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,355
<i>retrieved
from Bannockburn.</i>

522
00:30:33,356 --> 00:30:35,024
Tonight we rejoin
the stone

523
00:30:35,025 --> 00:30:37,026
which the English
broke asunder.

524
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:41,864
The ball is now
an assured success.

525
00:30:41,865 --> 00:30:43,565
Hmm...

526
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:02,985
<i>( door closes )</i>

527
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,587
( chuckles )

528
00:31:05,588 --> 00:31:08,223
Nothing changes, Golly.
You saw how we were treated.

529
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:09,825
Not by Archie.

530
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,161
<i>lain: His heart's in
the right place, man,</i>

531
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:15,130
but Glenbogle is gone.
It'll never rise again.

532
00:31:15,131 --> 00:31:18,767
Our ancestors thought that
about the sun.

533
00:31:18,768 --> 00:31:21,804
In the winter they built fires,
made music, danced,

534
00:31:21,805 --> 00:31:24,973
so the pounding of their feet
would awaken the earth.

535
00:31:24,974 --> 00:31:28,177
They didn't sit in a pub,
waiting for someone else to do it.

536
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:31,080
Young Archie's put his neck
on the block for you.

537
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:33,215
It's time you stood up
and were counted.

538
00:31:37,386 --> 00:31:40,222
What's this?

539
00:31:40,223 --> 00:31:43,892
You didn't honestly think you
could manage without me, did you?

540
00:31:43,893 --> 00:31:45,493
You know
that I can't.

541
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:48,864
It's not your fault
the chef walked out,

542
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,733
so Lexie
to the rescue.

543
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:54,870
Now away and do
some lairdly duties.

544
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,904
Let me to my kitchen.

545
00:31:55,905 --> 00:31:58,774
- I can help.
- I can manage.

546
00:31:58,775 --> 00:32:01,877
I'd like to,
if that's okay.

547
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,213
Go start
on the potatoes.

548
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:11,686
I don't deserve you,
you know that?

549
00:32:11,687 --> 00:32:13,822
What's to deserve?

550
00:32:13,823 --> 00:32:16,158
Where would I be
without you?

551
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:20,195
Probably doing the meat
as well as veg.

552
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,479
Duncan.
Just the man.

553
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,816
I hate to put this on you,
but our guests want to see

554
00:32:40,817 --> 00:32:43,318
something of the estate
before the ball.

555
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:45,053
No problem.

556
00:32:45,054 --> 00:32:47,555
Meet the cars at the gate.
You can walk from there.

557
00:32:47,556 --> 00:32:49,057
Walk?

558
00:32:49,058 --> 00:32:51,894
Take them on one
of your nature trails.

559
00:32:51,895 --> 00:32:56,131
Show them - oh, you know so
much more about it than I do.

560
00:32:56,132 --> 00:33:00,035
Use your... imagination.

561
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,281
You really should be
somewhere else.

562
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,149
Go on. your guests
are arriving.

563
00:33:18,254 --> 00:33:21,256
Amazing, all this time and
effort for just one night.

564
00:33:21,257 --> 00:33:23,558
Arch, it's what
you were born to do.

565
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:26,094
Same as this is
what I was born to do.

566
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:27,896
Each to their own, eh?

567
00:33:27,897 --> 00:33:29,832
I wish you were going
to be there, Lex.

568
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:32,267
I'll be here,
where you need me.

569
00:33:32,268 --> 00:33:35,904
Now, go. Stella will be
wondering where you are,

570
00:33:35,905 --> 00:33:37,840
and I have
work to do.

571
00:33:40,076 --> 00:33:42,477
Welcome to Glenbogle.

572
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,646
<i>And I'm pleased to offer,
as requested,</i>

573
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,549
<i>a short walking tour
of the estate.</i>

574
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,485
The theme of this
evening's tour will be,

575
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:53,722
"a day in the life
of a head ranger. "

576
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,435
Ah, Hamish, with
the Ochtaglen fragment.

577
00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:09,437
It's a proud day
to be a MacDonald.

578
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:13,075
And Robert, with the Kalpochie
fragment. All are safely gathered in.

579
00:34:13,076 --> 00:34:14,809
'Tis as well.
We none of us

580
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,379
want our families
blackened for all eternity.

581
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,714
- Quite so.
- Absolutely.

582
00:34:28,258 --> 00:34:30,759
Ah, Lord Cranthorne.

583
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,862
I've strict instructions-
no wallflowers.

584
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:37,632
So this is Melissa,
your buddy for the evening.

585
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:39,601
Wonderful idea,
this buddy system.

586
00:34:39,602 --> 00:34:43,372
Now, you two get to know each
other. I've more matches to make.

587
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,806
Come along.

588
00:35:08,798 --> 00:35:10,832
( playing off-key )

589
00:35:17,473 --> 00:35:19,241
Get that woman
away from me.

590
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,343
You didn't hit it off?
Oh, dear.

591
00:35:21,344 --> 00:35:23,979
Never mind, there's a nice
young man over here

592
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,014
who's simply dying
to be your buddy.

593
00:35:26,015 --> 00:35:28,783
Mother, I don't think Lord
Cranthorne needs a buddy.

594
00:35:28,784 --> 00:35:30,919
<i>Lexie would like
some help in the kitchen.</i>

595
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,854
Oh, excuse me.

596
00:35:32,855 --> 00:35:35,057
- All going very well.
- Do you think so?

597
00:35:35,058 --> 00:35:36,758
No, a disaster,
as predicted.

598
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,161
Not that it matters.
There are very few guests.

599
00:35:39,162 --> 00:35:41,396
The others will be
along soon, I'm sure.

600
00:35:41,397 --> 00:35:45,467
How do you maintain your relentless
optimism in the face of doom?

601
00:35:45,468 --> 00:35:47,502
Practice.

602
00:35:47,503 --> 00:35:49,838
Hmm.

603
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,608
I was only trying to help. I thought
this buddy thing was all the rage.

604
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,444
- Who told you that?
- Stella.

605
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:04,086
And so here we are.

606
00:36:05,488 --> 00:36:08,090
I can't accept
gratuities, gentlemen.

607
00:36:13,762 --> 00:36:16,298
What have you done to
them, you great white loaf?

608
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,700
<i>Duncan:
Just following orders.</i>

609
00:36:18,701 --> 00:36:21,569
Ha- I'll bet you
I know whose.

610
00:36:24,273 --> 00:36:26,741
I say, old man.
You've bad news?

611
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:30,578
Of the very worst kind.
The fragment has vanished again.

612
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:33,248
To lose the fragment once,
Hector, is unfortunate-

613
00:36:33,249 --> 00:36:35,150
<i>- to lose it-
- spare me the claptrap.</i>

614
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,252
I locked it in the sideboard
this morning.

615
00:36:37,253 --> 00:36:39,388
- Are you certain?
- Cranthorne watched me.

616
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:40,955
Ask him if you don't
believe me.

617
00:36:40,956 --> 00:36:43,825
Cranthorne? Whose forbearers
were defeated at Bannockburn

618
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:46,194
by your own, which we
celebrate this very night?

619
00:36:46,195 --> 00:36:48,463
- The same.
- Who had the means, the motive,

620
00:36:48,464 --> 00:36:51,099
and the opportunity to steal
the Glenbogle fragment?

621
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,202
<i>That Cranthorne?</i>

622
00:36:54,203 --> 00:36:57,239
Archie: The estate and the
bank are working hand in glove.

623
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,908
Villain!
I denounce you...

624
00:36:59,909 --> 00:37:02,010
as a thief
and a blackheart!

625
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:05,914
This man has stolen
the Glenbogle fragment!

626
00:37:05,915 --> 00:37:09,918
Gentlemen, please! Please,
I'm sure we can sort this out.

627
00:37:09,919 --> 00:37:12,854
<i>On with the ball.
There's nothing to see here.</i>

628
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:15,323
Music! dancing!

629
00:37:19,595 --> 00:37:22,730
I'd say we've got to the end
of the road, wouldn't you?

630
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:26,768
You give us just enough rope
to hang ourselves

631
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:28,836
and Archie
along with us.

632
00:37:28,837 --> 00:37:32,107
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Hector's greeting?

633
00:37:32,108 --> 00:37:34,376
- The crofter's stew?
- You cooked it.

634
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,911
The disappearing chef?
And Duncan's walking tours?

635
00:37:36,912 --> 00:37:39,147
- Well, you know Duncan-
- yeah, and so do you.

636
00:37:39,148 --> 00:37:41,550
Which leads me
to- "the buddy system. "

637
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,352
Lexie, I didn't mean
any harm.

638
00:37:44,353 --> 00:37:46,688
Yeah, right.

639
00:37:46,689 --> 00:37:50,992
I just wanted more time
here... with Archie.

640
00:37:50,993 --> 00:37:53,828
I never thought I'd fall
for anyone again...

641
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:56,898
after Graham.

642
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:00,935
And then
being here, I have.

643
00:38:00,936 --> 00:38:04,939
<i>Lexie, please
don't hate me for it.</i>

644
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,843
For loving Archie?
How can I?

645
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,781
Oh, god- bring back
the old Stella,

646
00:38:13,782 --> 00:38:17,919
the hard-nosed bitch you
could have a good scrap with.

647
00:38:20,223 --> 00:38:22,324
You're going
to tell him?

648
00:38:22,325 --> 00:38:25,193
I think that should
come from you.

649
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,276
Golly, do you think the Bogle
Boys could manage another dirge?

650
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:44,246
It's not entirely inappropriate
under the circumstances.

651
00:38:44,247 --> 00:38:46,615
I'm sorry, boss.

652
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:50,252
Okay. ah-!
They're not for you.

653
00:38:50,253 --> 00:38:52,854
Molly, take these
to the patrons, please.

654
00:38:52,855 --> 00:38:55,557
Hector, go and apologize
to Lord Cranthorne.

655
00:38:55,558 --> 00:38:57,759
Grovel, beg, crawl.
I don't care what you do,

656
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,128
but make sure he's here
in the next five minutes.

657
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,729
Golly, go and tell
the Bogle Boys

658
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,633
if their fingers aren't loose
in the next six minutes,

659
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,635
I'm going to pull them off
one by one.

660
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,371
- Duncan, kitchen.
- I know you're trying to help-

661
00:39:09,372 --> 00:39:12,807
you go and find Stella. She's
got something to tell you.

662
00:39:23,452 --> 00:39:24,952
<i>( knocking )</i>

663
00:39:27,523 --> 00:39:29,391
<i>You wanted something?</i>

664
00:39:31,227 --> 00:39:34,829
The last few days have been
a bit of a shambles-

665
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:38,700
Duncan, Hector,
the crofter's stew-

666
00:39:38,701 --> 00:39:41,203
yes, I don't know
what go into them.

667
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:43,805
It was me.

668
00:39:43,806 --> 00:39:46,341
I told Duncan
to use the Land Rover.

669
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:50,278
I told Lexie that Cranthorne
likes plain cooking.

670
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:53,348
Ah.

671
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,585
I wanted to stay here
because...

672
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,889
I think I've fallen
in love with you, Archie.

673
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:06,695
Look, Stella, I'm-

674
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:10,098
I thought you might feel the
same... if we had more time.

675
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:14,369
Now I've made a real fool
of myself. not like me, eh?

676
00:40:16,105 --> 00:40:18,039
You're fond of me,
aren't you?

677
00:40:19,275 --> 00:40:23,077
Actually, I think
there might be someone else.

678
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,514
( softly )
Lexie.

679
00:40:29,017 --> 00:40:31,386
She found me out
tonight.

680
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,921
She didn't say anything.

681
00:40:33,922 --> 00:40:37,925
She just put it right for
you. Like she always has.

682
00:40:37,926 --> 00:40:40,462
Like she always will...

683
00:40:40,463 --> 00:40:42,930
if you let her.

684
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,779
The last throw
of the dice.

685
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,248
Poor Hector.

686
00:41:11,661 --> 00:41:14,061
Come with me.

687
00:41:14,062 --> 00:41:17,666
I want you there when it
all fits together at last.

688
00:41:30,413 --> 00:41:33,481
<i>Man:
Present the stones.</i>

689
00:41:45,027 --> 00:41:47,429
<i>Hamish:
Hector MacDonald...</i>

690
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:50,097
a dark duty
befalls me,

691
00:41:50,098 --> 00:41:53,702
for a part of the stone
that was broken has been lost.

692
00:41:53,703 --> 00:41:55,637
Just mislaid.

693
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,473
Oh, Archie!

694
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,476
Fellow MacDonalds,
honored guests,

695
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,978
<i>we've had a sassenach
in our midst.</i>

696
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,414
A sassenach we thrashed
at Bannockburn.

697
00:42:06,415 --> 00:42:09,317
<i>Lord Cranthorne,</i>

698
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:12,153
you have witnessed us
at our worst.

699
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,556
I'm so glad you were able
to remain long enough

700
00:42:14,557 --> 00:42:17,392
to see us at our best.
Our unity...

701
00:42:17,393 --> 00:42:19,761
our pride in who we are
and what we've achieved,

702
00:42:19,762 --> 00:42:22,597
and our confidence
in the future.

703
00:42:24,433 --> 00:42:26,735
Lord Cranthorne...

704
00:42:28,437 --> 00:42:30,037
would you be so kind?

705
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:36,478
I'd be honored, sir.

706
00:42:42,385 --> 00:42:44,719
What was broken,
is now restored...

707
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,154
like this
great estate.

708
00:42:47,155 --> 00:42:49,624
There's a spirit
in Glenbogle,

709
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:54,362
<i>and I share Hector's faith
in the future.</i>

710
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,999
Archie... Laird...

711
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,135
Glenbogle is restored
to you again.

712
00:43:01,136 --> 00:43:03,838
( applause, cheers )

713
00:43:05,674 --> 00:43:07,475
<i>Graeme:
Now that's worth a tune!</i>

714
00:43:07,476 --> 00:43:09,611
( playing in tune )

715
00:43:21,156 --> 00:43:24,191
I've scheduled five meetings.
They're all panting to invest.

716
00:43:24,192 --> 00:43:26,761
<i>They seem to think this was
a sort of themed evening.</i>

717
00:43:26,762 --> 00:43:28,830
All this chaos,
then Lascelles sweeps in

718
00:43:28,831 --> 00:43:31,733
- bringing success and happiness.
- One travels in hope.

719
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:39,040
Toby seems to think
you can manage without me.

720
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:41,743
He's offered me
South America.

721
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,512
Not all of it?

722
00:43:44,513 --> 00:43:46,948
If it was, it would come
in a very poor second.

723
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:49,350
You'll be missed.

724
00:43:50,686 --> 00:43:54,388
I'll always carry this
place in my heart, Archie,

725
00:43:54,389 --> 00:43:56,624
wherever I am.

726
00:44:02,565 --> 00:44:04,098
Goodbye, Archie.

727
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,867
Goodbye.

728
00:44:42,605 --> 00:44:45,507
Well, that went
okay, didn't it?

729
00:44:45,508 --> 00:44:48,175
Better than that.
You are a wonder.

730
00:44:48,176 --> 00:44:50,478
Get away.

731
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:53,080
Bet you'll never get
another housekeeper like me.

732
00:44:54,282 --> 00:44:56,417
You know,

733
00:44:56,418 --> 00:44:59,754
all this time,
there's been something...

734
00:44:59,755 --> 00:45:02,624
working away
at me inside.

735
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:07,128
These last few days,
I realize what it is.

736
00:45:08,296 --> 00:45:10,297
Crofter's stew,
probably.

737
00:45:10,298 --> 00:45:12,734
Lexie, I love you.

738
00:45:13,802 --> 00:45:15,670
I think
I always have.

739
00:45:18,741 --> 00:45:21,242
This isn't
a fairy tale, Arch.

740
00:45:21,243 --> 00:45:24,946
We don't get
a happy ending.

741
00:45:26,048 --> 00:45:28,616
We do if we
love each other.

742
00:45:28,617 --> 00:45:32,286
But you're the laird.
I'm still the housekeeper.

743
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:36,190
I want you
to be my wife.

744
00:45:37,993 --> 00:45:40,862
I couldn't live up
to that.

745
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,665
I'd let you down.
I couldn't bear that.

746
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:46,901
You wouldn't let me down.
You never let me down.

747
00:45:46,902 --> 00:45:49,336
That's different.

748
00:45:49,337 --> 00:45:51,906
This- this is
what I know.

749
00:45:51,907 --> 00:45:54,909
- This is where I belong.
- You belong with me.

750
00:45:57,279 --> 00:46:00,048
Don't.

751
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:03,051
I'm not right for you.

752
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:06,054
There are all kinds
of excuses

753
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:09,090
for letting happiness
slip through your fingers.

754
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:10,858
<i>Let's not do that.</i>

755
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:13,661
Let's take our chance.

756
00:46:17,766 --> 00:46:19,834
Look at this place.

757
00:46:23,171 --> 00:46:26,173
If it's clean for breakfast,
it'll be a miracle.

758
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:02,744
( footsteps )

759
00:47:17,693 --> 00:47:20,762
( music plays )

760
00:47:20,763 --> 00:47:23,430
Take a chance?

761
00:47:35,711 --> 00:47:38,746
I don't have
a ring.

762
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,255
No excuses.

763
00:48:41,944 --> 00:48:45,012
