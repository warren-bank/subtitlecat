4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,102
Now what or who would you
say that is, Monty?

5
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,046
Good lord.
Big Eric.

6
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:37,522
Lexie! Golly!
Where are you?

7
00:00:37,523 --> 00:00:40,324
What's new, pussycat?

8
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:42,660
Lexie, my jacket!

9
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:44,128
Golly!

10
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,296
Come on, come on.

11
00:00:49,768 --> 00:00:52,236
Don't tell me, you've been
invited on "The Clothes Show"?

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,041
Golly!

13
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:00,310
What's all the commotion?

14
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:05,382
Morning, darling.

15
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:13,424
<i>( dog barking )</i>

16
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:16,794
- Stand aside, boy!
- What?

17
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:19,630
- Give me that.
- Sir, you should be careful.

18
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:21,766
Stand aside.

19
00:01:23,936 --> 00:01:26,070
Hector!
What is it?

20
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:27,772
Big Eric, Golly,
Big Eric!

21
00:01:39,985 --> 00:01:43,087
What's my foolish
husband up to now?

22
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:45,957
- I tried to tell him, honest.
- Tell him what?

23
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,825
That the throttle
keeps jamming.

24
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:09,046
Arghhh!

25
00:02:15,854 --> 00:02:18,823

26
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,627

27
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:57,194

<i>Man's voice: Hello,
Flying Fish Restaurant.</i>

29
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:12,743
Come on, Terry.
Get a move on it.

30
00:03:12,744 --> 00:03:14,078
Curtain up
in three hours.

31
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,345
Right-
I've rung around.

32
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:17,648
11 confirmed,
all bringing partners.

33
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:18,883
Archie, telephone.

34
00:03:18,884 --> 00:03:21,018
Great, a swarm of critics
all coming here.

35
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:23,453
That's all right
- what is it? A shoal? A flock?

36
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,756
Terry, what's the collective
noun for food writers?

37
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:27,992
Why are you so calm?
I'm terrified already.

38
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:30,327
What could they do
but destroy the enterprise

39
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:31,862
We've slaved for years
to get going?

40
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:32,930
Shut up.

41
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:34,231
Justine,
it will be wonderful.

42
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:35,666
You'll be serene
and beautiful.

43
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:38,202
They'll love our little place, the food.

44
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:40,938
Hello. Mother.

45
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:42,372
Your father,

46
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:45,475
Nasty accident, dear,
in the loch.

47
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:48,145
In the loch?

48
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:52,316
No, of course,
I'll come.

49
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:54,185
Yeah, I'll get
the sleeper tonight.

50
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:57,855
Okay. Bye.

51
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:03,728
My father's had some
sort of accident.

52
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:07,865
I'm sorry,
tonight of all nights.

53
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:10,400
You have to go. I'll
book you a cab to Houston.

54
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:13,104
I'll manage.

55
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:17,007
Archie, this is just
a tiny restaurant.

56
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,977
Your family are 10 times
more important.

57
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:05,790
You be himself?

58
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,624
Yeah, I suppose I am.

59
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:16,100
How is he today?

60
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:17,935
Your dad?

61
00:05:17,936 --> 00:05:19,736
Ach, he's in
a terrible state.

62
00:05:21,273 --> 00:05:24,175
What did you do that for,
you stupid woman?

63
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:25,542
Do stop fussing, Hector.

64
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:27,411
What will he do when
he gets here, eh?

65
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:29,914
Damn boy's always been as
much use as a chocolate teapot.

66
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:33,017
Hector, you know
very well- it's time.

67
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:34,384
I don't want him here.

68
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:35,686
And what do you want?

69
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:37,521
Going fishing again,
are we, Hector?

70
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:40,057
I couldn't find my
slippers, damn it.

71
00:05:40,058 --> 00:05:41,558
Enjoy!

72
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,893
Hags and harpies!

73
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:44,394
I'm surrounded
by hags and harp-

74
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:45,963
Where are my
Marmite soldiers?

75
00:05:45,964 --> 00:05:47,998
I had them court-martialed and shot.

76
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:50,901
I always have Marmite
soldiers with my boiled egg.

77
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:52,236
Bairns will be bairns.

78
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:54,038
I am Hector
Naismith MacDonald,

79
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:56,406
14th chief
of an ancient line,

80
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:59,076
Laird of Glenbogle,
Ochintummel and Blawearie

81
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:00,911
Or to you, girl,
just plain sir.

82
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:03,047
<i>Ach, away and play
with your lineage.</i>

83
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:42,619
Mm-mm. Tasty.
Eh, Duncan?

84
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,155
<i>Duncan.
Duncan't.</i>

85
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:57,368
Hello?

86
00:07:00,605 --> 00:07:01,605
Hello.

87
00:07:07,545 --> 00:07:09,579
Oh, darling.

88
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,115
Mother.

89
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:16,620
- How is he?
- How was your journey?

90
00:07:16,621 --> 00:07:18,755
- How bad is it?
- We're so glad you're back.

91
00:07:18,756 --> 00:07:21,725
- We need you, you see.
- What did the doctor say?

92
00:07:21,726 --> 00:07:25,129
So, the vultures
are circling.

93
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,430
Father.

94
00:07:26,431 --> 00:07:28,565
Excited by the prospect
of my imminent demise?

95
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:30,935
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

96
00:07:30,936 --> 00:07:33,070
You were supposed
to be really ill.

97
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:36,140
I was temporarily
immersed in water.

98
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:39,209
A trifle peaty, but I don't
expect to start dissolving.

99
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,211
Just what is
going on here?

100
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:43,047
Tell me, how's that bar
of yours doing?

101
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:45,215
Hector, behave.
Pay no attention, dear.

102
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:47,084
It's not a bar.
It's a restaurant.

103
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:48,652
It opened last night.

104
00:07:48,653 --> 00:07:50,921
Never thought a son of mine
would turn out a publican.

105
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:52,556
<i>I blame that awful
Thatcher woman.</i>

106
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:55,592
- I'm going back right now.
- Darling, I-I-

107
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:58,628
- Who are you?
- Robbie, my boy.

108
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:01,465
Robert Fraser.
Great to meet you.

109
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:03,767
<i>I manage the estate.</i>

110
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:06,403
Under your father's
guiding hand of course.

111
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:09,173
And a jolly good job
you make of it.

112
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:11,175
Come, we've work to do.

113
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:15,045
Mother!?

114
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:19,850
<i>Archie: We worked for months
- for years to get the premises,</i>

115
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:21,352
Get the money,
the staff.

116
00:08:21,353 --> 00:08:22,819
Finally it all
comes together,

117
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,688
We plan this big opening night-
and where am I?

118
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:26,823
He was so very fragile.

119
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:28,325
I'm on a sleeper
to Scotland,

120
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:30,027
Hurrying to my dying
father's bedside.

121
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:32,062
I thought you might be
able to help. That's all.

122
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:33,930
Help with what?

123
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,732
Duncan, where are my bags?

124
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:37,201
They're in the um...

125
00:08:37,202 --> 00:08:39,336
I thought you should
like your old room.

126
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:41,338
I have to get back.
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:44,274
Whatever you say.
You're a good boy.

128
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:32,923
<i>Woman: Katrina, you'll
never guess. He's returned.</i>

129
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:35,625
Who, maureen?
The Jedi?

130
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:38,228
Jesus Christ?
Elvis Presley?

131
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:41,131
The son and heir,
Archie MacDonald.

132
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:42,599
After all these years.

133
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,835
I will not have my life defined
by the tedious goings-on

134
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,872
At what you're pleased to call
"the big house. "

135
00:09:48,873 --> 00:09:51,341
Very good-looking
from what I hear.

136
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:57,013
( clicking )

137
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:32,149
( phone beeping )

138
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:35,319
Justine?

139
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:42,292
Ah, Duncan-

140
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:44,294
Archie will be wanting
to go back to the station.

141
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:46,463
- I'll be ready for him.
- Jolly good.

142
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:50,167
Geordie, it's Molly.

143
00:10:50,168 --> 00:10:51,668
Hi, it's me.

144
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:54,338
Hello. Yeah.

145
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:56,406
No, he's fine.

146
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:59,376
Fontwell Park, 4:30,
horse called...

147
00:11:01,546 --> 00:11:03,113
"Tickle My Fancy. "

148
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:05,081
What price?

149
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,083
Put 50 on for me.
Good man.

150
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:10,654
Well, it's not quite
as simple as that.

151
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:12,523
Hello?

152
00:11:12,524 --> 00:11:15,225
Oh, god. Hello?

153
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:16,893
Hello?

154
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:19,496
Hello, Justine?

155
00:11:19,497 --> 00:11:22,299
Justine, hello.
Hello?

156
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,469
Justine...
Justine! (echoing )

157
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:44,521
( birds chirping )

158
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,676
<i>( twig snapping )</i>

159
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:18,822
Mom's on the nest.
Dad's off fishing.

160
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:21,425
Trying anyway.

161
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,695
He's a useless specimen.

162
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:26,162
<i>It's the same
throughout nature-</i>

163
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,031
Female does the work
making the home,

164
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:30,367
Looking after the bairns,
putting food on the table-

165
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:32,068
Very funny.

166
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:35,305
Whereas the male now,
he just stumbles along,

167
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:37,541
Unsure of himself, what
he's supposed to be doing...

168
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:40,644
Making a mess
wherever he goes.

169
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:42,946
Just like that
fellow there.

170
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:44,314
<i>Where?</i>

171
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:03,833
- Get up!
- Are you mad?

172
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:06,002
<i>Too right, I'm mad.
God, I hate you people.</i>

173
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:08,272
- Katrina. Katrina!
- Come away out of there!

174
00:13:09,807 --> 00:13:12,609
Golly? Is that you?

175
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,943
Laddie.

176
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:17,847
It's great to see you.

177
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:19,949

too long, youngster.

This is him, isn't it?

180
00:13:23,187 --> 00:13:24,888
I don't know?
Are you him?

181
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:26,723
I was, until the wild woman
of the woods

182
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:28,425
Started to rearrange
my arms and legs.

183
00:13:28,426 --> 00:13:30,761
<i>- Now listen, you...
- Archie, meet Katrina,</i>

184
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:34,298
A loyal tenant
of the Glenbogle estate.

185
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:37,434
- I thought you were after the ospreys.
- The what?

186
00:13:37,435 --> 00:13:40,304
Big thing with feathers,
nests in that tree there.

187
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:42,238
<i>Nearly extinct
thanks to chinless wonders</i>

188
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,408
Who thought they looked
better on the mantelpiece.

189
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:46,543
Okay, Mrs. Attenborough,
I've seen the documentary.

190
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:49,045
The nest further up the glen
was robbed last week.

191
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:50,847
<i>Katrina: That's why we built the hide.</i>

192
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:53,283
Organized a rota
to watch the nest.

193
00:13:53,284 --> 00:13:55,686
What she means is
the kids built the hide.

194
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:57,454
<i>She organized the rota.</i>

195
00:13:57,455 --> 00:13:59,589
Well, if the landowner

196
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,591
Won't take his responsibilities
seriously,

197
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,560
The community will.

198
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:05,295
It's our land really,
anyway.

199
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:08,097
I'm sorry, run that one
past me again, will you?

200
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,108
<i>Archie:
You have a family, then?</i>

201
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,144
No, I don't.

202
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:24,514
It's just that Golly
mentioned you had kids.

203
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:25,816
Oh,

204
00:14:25,817 --> 00:14:27,751
I'm the head teacher
of the village school.

205
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:28,918
Oh, that old place.

206
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,253
It's very
well equipped.

207
00:14:30,254 --> 00:14:32,288
And the kids are as
bright as buttons.

208
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,290
- I'm sure. I didn't mean-
- good thing, too,

209
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,059
'cause they're the future
of this place, not-

210
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:39,629
Anyway, are you
staying long?

211
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,398
No, I have to
get back tonight.

212
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:45,802
Well, well,
would you look at that.

213
00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:56,279
We've all manner of modern
contraptions up here, you know.

214
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,315
Telephones,
spinning jennies, the wheel.

215
00:15:14,064 --> 00:15:16,733
<i>( muted hip-hop music playing )</i>

216
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,414
Mother, father-

217
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:32,549
<i>I have to go-
the sleeper.</i>

218
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,351
Oh. Very well, darling.

219
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,454
Lovely to see you.

220
00:15:37,455 --> 00:15:38,855
Take care.

221
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,123
<i>Hector:
Off you toddle.</i>

222
00:15:40,124 --> 00:15:41,991
I did enjoy
our little chat.

223
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:48,632
Turn that wretched
hurdy-gurdy off.

224
00:15:55,406 --> 00:15:57,240
<i>( loud hip-hop music )</i>

225
00:15:59,444 --> 00:16:01,545
You won't catch much
with that object, laddie,

226
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:04,247
Except maybe a cold.
Archie's waiting.

227
00:16:09,954 --> 00:16:12,322
( pan sizzles, bagpipes groan )

228
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:16,693
Does this smell
all right to you?

229
00:16:19,797 --> 00:16:21,164
Sorry.

230
00:16:32,844 --> 00:16:36,513
( engine cranks )

231
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:46,022
No go.

232
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:48,492
I'll have to strip
the carburetor.

233
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:52,095
Really?

234
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,648
<i>Hector:
Well, what are we having?</i>

235
00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:14,618
Fatted calf?
I hope not.

236
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:18,989
Sorry I'm late.

237
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,657
Great.
You're staying.

238
00:17:20,658 --> 00:17:22,058
Love to show
you around.

239
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:24,127
I've had another quote
on the timber, Hector.

240
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,294
Looks quite promising.

241
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,563
- Good boy.
- See, Archie,

242
00:17:26,564 --> 00:17:28,197
<i>Prices have fallen
through the floor.</i>

243
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:29,566
<i>Cheap imports
from Scandinavia.</i>

244
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:31,801
It's hardly worth
growing the things.

245
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,037
- But I had this idea-
- don't waste your breath,

246
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:35,639
He won't be interested.

247
00:17:39,544 --> 00:17:42,546
A man could starve
in his own dining room here.

248
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:44,147
Lexie!

249
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:45,749
( Golly clears throat )

250
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,585
I'd suck a "Fisherman's Friend"
if I had a throat like that.

251
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:50,219
Trousers.

252
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:54,891
Aye, one must maintain
standards, mustn't one?

253
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,900
<i>( bagpipes hum )</i>

254
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:29,192
<i>( bagpipes playing )</i>

255
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:30,760
Ah.

256
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:54,317
( sniffs )

257
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:02,659
Hell's flames.
Not again.

258
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:10,533
Oh, heck.

259
00:19:10,534 --> 00:19:12,002
Fuse again.

260
00:19:12,003 --> 00:19:13,770
It's kind
of exciting, eh?

261
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:15,404
Down here in the dark,

262
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,874
Crushed up like a pair
of amorous sardines.

263
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,575
Pass us
the screwdriver.

264
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:22,445
You always were one for
your tools? Eh, big boy?

265
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:25,081
Careful, Dunc,
you're squeezing my funbags.

266
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,619
How does she do it?
267
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,320
<i>I've tasted
better shoe leather.</i>

268
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:32,889
She does her best, dear.

269
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,924
I sometimes think
she does it deliberately.

270
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:37,527
And what says the expert?

271
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:39,328
<i>Would you
serve this muck?</i>

272
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:40,864
<i>Tell me,
this cafe of yours,</i>

273
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:42,832
Do customers actually
pay you money?

274
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,268
Hector, must you be so rude?

275
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:48,271
Bad behavior is one of
the few privileges of old age.

276
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:51,340
Anyone for another
slice of Bambi?

277
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:54,144
Well, who'd have thought it?
You of all people.

278
00:19:54,145 --> 00:19:57,413
Build something of my own? Yes, that
must be amazing to someone like you.

279
00:19:57,414 --> 00:19:58,848
Maybe not.

280
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00,616
Glenbogle has been
my career, dear boy.

281
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,085
If you want to see my life,

282
00:20:02,086 --> 00:20:04,154
As Christopher Wren said-
"Look about you. "

283
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:06,556
At what? This crumbling ruin
where the phone doesn't work

284
00:20:06,557 --> 00:20:07,824
And the lights don't come on?

285
00:20:09,193 --> 00:20:11,460
And the Lord said
"Let there be light. "

286
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,262
Thank you, Robbie.

287
00:20:16,701 --> 00:20:18,401
<i>Molly: Sorry you
missed your train, dear.</i>

288
00:20:18,402 --> 00:20:20,670
Very irritating.

289
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:22,471
<i>Yes.</i>

290
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,640
But I'll make sure
I get it tomorrow night.

291
00:20:41,225 --> 00:20:43,727
<i>( Hector singing )</i>

292
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:47,864

That's it.

<i>Man:
Yeah, no problem.</i>

300
00:21:48,592 --> 00:21:51,161
Ah, I'll call you back.

301
00:21:51,162 --> 00:21:52,695
Yes.

302
00:21:54,464 --> 00:21:55,832
Archie. Morning.

303
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,101
We've been
reconnected, then?

304
00:21:58,102 --> 00:22:00,203
I thought we'd
been cut off.

305
00:22:00,204 --> 00:22:02,738
Oh, things aren't
quite that bad.

306
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,975
The estate's in trouble?

307
00:22:10,848 --> 00:22:12,581
Look, um...

308
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,988
Why don't you have a wee
peek at this on your laptop?

309
00:22:20,858 --> 00:22:22,391
<i>It sets out
all you need to know</i>

310
00:22:22,392 --> 00:22:23,726
<i>In black and white...</i>

311
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:27,697
And steadily encroaching red.

312
00:22:39,376 --> 00:22:41,510
Blimey.

313
00:22:41,511 --> 00:22:42,778
Have you seen
the figures?

314
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,413
Fraser's always
banging on about them.

315
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:45,748
No time for them myself.

316
00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:47,450
Father, it's serious.
The bank are-

317
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:49,418
My dear boy, the
MacDonalds have been in hock

318
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:51,354
To those shysters since
the battle of Culloden.

319
00:22:51,355 --> 00:22:52,956
You owe them
a fortune.

320
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:54,891
They could sling you out
whenever they wanted.

321
00:22:54,892 --> 00:22:57,894
My father once gave me the
most wonderful piece of advice.

322
00:22:57,895 --> 00:22:59,762
- You've spoken to Fraser?
- "Life," he said,

323
00:22:59,763 --> 00:23:01,264
"sometimes bowls
one a bumper-"

324
00:23:01,265 --> 00:23:03,833
Father, for once,
will you please listen to me?

325
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:05,134
"but the important
thing,

326
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,503
Is always to play
a straight bat. "

327
00:23:07,504 --> 00:23:09,472
This is about the future-
yours and mother's.

328
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,007
You must do something.

329
00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:13,209
I'm very grateful for your
concern, if not your advice,

330
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,678
But as we've done without
either for the last 10 years-

331
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,513
Hector.
Stop this nonsense.

332
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:19,548
You must tell him.

333
00:23:21,218 --> 00:23:22,718
Tell me what?

334
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:26,256
Very well.

335
00:23:26,257 --> 00:23:28,258
The estate no longer
belongs to your father.

336
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:29,692
Molly.

337
00:23:29,693 --> 00:23:32,762
It was made over to you
some time ago, through a trust.

338
00:23:34,765 --> 00:23:36,565
I own the house?

339
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:38,134
<i>The estate?</i>

340
00:23:38,135 --> 00:23:40,904
Legal technicality. Tax dodge.
The lawyers made me do it.

341
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:42,538
<i>Molly:
If we hadn't,</i>

342
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,908
You'd have been liable
to crippling death duties...

343
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:47,610
Well, er, later on.

344
00:23:47,611 --> 00:23:49,779
I'm Laird of Glenbogle?

345
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,116
- You're the only son.
- Not how it should have been.

346
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:57,853
Come on, I think we're all
in need of a sherry.

347
00:23:57,854 --> 00:24:00,623
I'm not finished yet.
Not by a long chalk.

348
00:24:00,624 --> 00:24:02,191
<i>I'm still head
of the family,</i>

349
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,759
<i>And don't you
forget it.</i>

350
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,905
<i>Fraser: The place has been
hemorrhaging cash for years.</i>

351
00:24:15,906 --> 00:24:18,874
Well, you know what these
Highland estates are like.

352
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,977
They need a sugar daddy.

353
00:24:20,978 --> 00:24:23,446
Always have, always will.

354
00:24:23,447 --> 00:24:25,781
You were saying
the timber brings in nothing.

355
00:24:25,782 --> 00:24:28,952
And your father won't let me
market the sporting side properly,

356
00:24:28,953 --> 00:24:31,254
Or raise rents, or sack
any of the estate workers.

357
00:24:31,255 --> 00:24:34,557
I mean, Golly, for instance.
He's well past his sell-by date.

358
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,559
Golly is family.

359
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,527
Of course.

360
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:40,163
He's a marvelous chap.

361
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:43,566
Anyway...

362
00:24:45,535 --> 00:24:47,270
It's all yours now.

363
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:48,804
Well I won't have it.

364
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:51,674
But I might be able
to persuade my father

365
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:53,542
To do the sensible thing.

366
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:54,910
Which is what?

367
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,879
Give you your head?

368
00:24:59,183 --> 00:25:01,017
I could cut the losses,

369
00:25:01,018 --> 00:25:03,286
But it still wouldn't
pay its way.

370
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:04,753
So...?

371
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:08,057
Well, your parents are...

372
00:25:08,058 --> 00:25:10,659
Cash-poor but asset rich.

373
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:15,298
It's obvious.

374
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,166
Hanging on, it's...

375
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:19,068
Putting off
the inevitable.

376
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:26,109
Sell Glenbogle.

377
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:31,747
There's a couple of chaps
coming to stalk tomorrow who...

378
00:25:33,317 --> 00:25:34,884
Might be interested.

379
00:25:41,892 --> 00:25:43,926
Ah, how is
the new proprietor?

380
00:25:43,927 --> 00:25:45,628
Got everything
sorted out, have you?

381
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:47,897
Lexie, you're looking
very pert today.

382
00:25:47,898 --> 00:25:51,034
- Down, Hector.
- Isn't pert the most splendid word?

383
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:53,436
<i>- Father- - Hector: Told
me a good one the other day,</i>

384
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:55,704
Didn't you, girl?
Man goes to see quack,

385
00:25:55,705 --> 00:25:58,574
Says "doctor, I've a cricket
ball stuck up my what's-it. "

386
00:25:58,575 --> 00:26:00,376
There's something
we need to talk about.

387
00:26:00,377 --> 00:26:03,012
Doctor says, "how's that?"
man says, "don't you start. "

388
00:26:03,013 --> 00:26:04,914
Ha, ha!
"don't you start. "

389
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:07,650
<i>( Hector laughs, coughs )</i>

390
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,485
I'm only gonna say this once.

391
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:12,855
I didn't come back here
because I wanted to-

392
00:26:12,856 --> 00:26:14,457
My life is somewhere else.

393
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,625
And I didn't ask you
to give me the estate,

394
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:19,095
It's the last thing I wanted.
I told you that years ago.

395
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:20,530
I didn't do it for you.

396
00:26:20,531 --> 00:26:22,698
For the family,
14 generations of it-

397
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:25,101
Fairy cake, anyone?

398
00:26:25,102 --> 00:26:28,104
- The estate is bankrupt.
- Want to run away again, do you?

399
00:26:28,105 --> 00:26:31,574
There's only one thing to
be done. It must be sold.

400
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,544
Never!

401
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:38,047
You have to be protected from
yourself. I shall sell it for you.

402
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:40,583
I sometimes wonder
what I did

403
00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:42,851
To deserve you as a son.

404
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:45,588
That's easy-

405
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:47,356
You impregnated
his mother.

406
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:48,991
Father!

407
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,396
I feel a bit shivery.

408
00:26:53,397 --> 00:26:55,631
I'm going to bed.

409
00:26:55,632 --> 00:26:57,133
Don't be ridiculous.

410
00:26:59,336 --> 00:27:01,471
I don't feel at all well.

411
00:27:09,246 --> 00:27:11,680
<i>Molly:
Come on, Geordie.</i>

412
00:27:11,681 --> 00:27:13,816
<i>I am not going to back
one of his horses.</i>

413
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:16,486
<i>The man's hopeless. He
couldn't train white mice</i>

414
00:27:16,487 --> 00:27:18,154
To eat cheese.

415
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:22,024
I'm sorry, darling.

416
00:27:22,025 --> 00:27:23,493
It was all
in a good cause.

417
00:27:23,494 --> 00:27:26,862
This place
is no good for me.

418
00:27:26,863 --> 00:27:28,397
I'm going home now.

419
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:34,270
Duncan!

420
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:36,939
Duncan!

421
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:40,510
The station,

422
00:27:40,511 --> 00:27:42,044
And no funny business
this time.

423
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:51,920
( engine starts )

424
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:03,199
Get permission from
the escape committee?


425
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:06,802
I love that film.

426
00:28:06,803 --> 00:28:09,338
Steve McQueen
on his big German bike-

427
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:11,774
Brrrmm, brrr.

428
00:28:14,578 --> 00:28:15,711
Station.

429
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:20,883
You'll be after
the sleeper.

430
00:28:20,884 --> 00:28:22,451
It's Saturday,
mind.

431
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,886
I know, Duncan.

432
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:25,555
I did a time management
course once,

433
00:28:25,556 --> 00:28:28,157
The first things they taught me
was the days of the week.

434
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,627
Sleeper doesn't run
on a Saturday.

435
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:33,596
( squealing brakes )

436
00:28:41,938 --> 00:28:43,539
I'll walk back.

437
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,074
I need air.

438
00:29:17,274 --> 00:29:18,207
Hey!

439
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,510
<i>Golly:
Shush, laddie-</i>

440
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:23,479
You'll disturb the wildlife.

441
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,582
- Come on.
- Golly?

442
00:29:58,582 --> 00:30:00,849
( men talking )

443
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:30,379
( sniffing )

444
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,047
I smell something.

445
00:30:32,048 --> 00:30:33,015
Something sweet.

446
00:30:34,884 --> 00:30:36,952
Did you bring
your shotgun?

447
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:38,587
Nice perfume,
lass.

448
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,289
I'd like to shoot
the pigs.

449
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,858
I saw lights coming
from the hide. There.

450
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,842
- Hey, who's that?
- What's going on?

451
00:30:59,843 --> 00:31:02,010
<i>Golly: Save your breath
to cool your broth.</i>

452
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:03,713
Or for your statements.

453
00:31:03,714 --> 00:31:05,414
Police'll be here
in about an hour.

454
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:07,616
Will they not
frighten the ospreys?

455
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,785
They would do
if they had the right tree.

456
00:31:13,189 --> 00:31:15,290
Thanks for nothing, clothead.

457
00:31:16,993 --> 00:31:19,294
<i>Archie: I saw the van parked
at the house this morning.</i>

458
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,696
<i>Fraser was talking
to the driver.</i>

459
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:22,130
You can bet
your bottom dollar

460
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,834
It won't be the only way
he's robbing your da.

461
00:31:24,835 --> 00:31:27,436
Well, it'll never
stand up in court.

462
00:31:27,437 --> 00:31:29,137
Who said anything
about a court?

463
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,006
The Laird has
a quiet word

464
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:32,875
With the factor
and then he's out.

465
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:35,077
My father...

466
00:31:35,078 --> 00:31:36,779
He's got other worries.

467
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,615
He's not as fit
as he used to be.

468
00:31:39,616 --> 00:31:42,150
<i>Not as young
as he used to be.</i>

469
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:44,754
- ( sighs )
- what is it?

470
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,391
I just found out that-

471
00:31:48,392 --> 00:31:49,892
I own the estate.

472
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:53,629
Get away.

473
00:31:55,699 --> 00:31:56,932
<i>Well, um,</i>

474
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:59,101
I mean no disrespect
to the old devil

475
00:31:59,102 --> 00:32:01,303
But, um, I'm delighted.

476
00:32:01,304 --> 00:32:03,572
Yeah.

477
00:32:03,573 --> 00:32:06,041
<i>You'll soon get things
squared round.</i>

478
00:32:08,144 --> 00:32:09,879
I can't stay, Golly.

479
00:32:14,618 --> 00:32:15,851
In fact...

480
00:32:18,054 --> 00:32:20,322
None of us'll
be staying.

481
00:32:20,323 --> 00:32:22,591
What's that supposed
to mean?

482
00:32:25,995 --> 00:32:28,263
I think we have
to sell Glenbogle.

483
00:32:28,264 --> 00:32:29,698
Sell?!

484
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,301
Sell?

485
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,071
Sell your home?

486
00:32:36,072 --> 00:32:37,973
Your birthright!


487
00:32:39,175 --> 00:32:41,343
No, it was never that.
Not mine, anyway.

488
00:32:41,344 --> 00:32:44,112
<i>Golly: There have been
MacDonalds here for 400 years.</i>

489
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:46,615
Your name'll
be blackened forever.

490
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:48,751
You can't do this.

491
00:32:48,752 --> 00:32:51,053
<i>Katrina: Do you want to
know what will happen?</i>

492
00:32:53,122 --> 00:32:54,523
I'll tell you.

493
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:56,759
A new owner'll come in,

494
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,462
Jobs'll go,
people's homes with them.

495
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:01,029
<i>The place'll
be finished.</i>

496
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,732
It doesn't have to be
like that, Katrina.

497
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:09,237
I'm sorry, Golly.

498
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:11,907
And you're proposing to just...

499
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:14,209
...Just walk away from it?

500
00:33:16,145 --> 00:33:18,781
There's two potential buyers
stalking tomorrow.

501
00:33:18,782 --> 00:33:21,049
I hope you'll give them
a good day's sport.

502
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,234
Oh, the rabbits have
been at everything.

503
00:33:39,235 --> 00:33:40,703
Damn their eyes.

504
00:33:40,704 --> 00:33:42,371
Is father up yet?

505
00:33:42,372 --> 00:33:44,072
No, he said he's
not getting out of bed

506
00:33:44,073 --> 00:33:45,674
Until you come
to your senses.

507
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:47,776
This happens every time
I come home.

508
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:49,979
I disappoint him and
he makes me feel bad.

509
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,213
It's not easy.

510
00:33:51,214 --> 00:33:52,748
What about the estate?

511
00:33:52,749 --> 00:33:55,718
Oh, poor you.

512
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:57,820
Here, this might help.

513
00:33:57,821 --> 00:33:59,522
What?

514
00:34:01,357 --> 00:34:03,526
Mother, I thought all your
family money went years ago.

515
00:34:03,527 --> 00:34:05,694
It did. It's mine.

516
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:08,531
My winnings
on the gee-gees.

517
00:34:08,532 --> 00:34:10,098
I did it all myself,

518
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:12,200
With a little help
from Geordie, of course.

519
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:13,435
Geordie?

520
00:34:13,436 --> 00:34:15,504
<i>My turf accountant.</i>

521
00:34:15,505 --> 00:34:18,306
You know, it's the first money
I've earned in my whole life.

522
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:20,108
Wonderful feeling,
isn't it?

523
00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:21,944
Oh, yes, but-

524
00:34:21,945 --> 00:34:25,581
This is 55,000, the estate
owes the bank 375,000.

525
00:34:25,582 --> 00:34:27,583
Oh, what a pity.

526
00:34:27,584 --> 00:34:29,351
- I thought-
- Oh, mother!

527
00:34:29,352 --> 00:34:31,820
You're the best of all of us,
you know that?

528
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:36,692
What are you going
to do, hmm?

529
00:34:36,693 --> 00:34:38,493
I'd be perfectly happy

530
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:40,796
With a little flat
in Cadogan Square,

531
00:34:40,797 --> 00:34:43,599
But your father-
it's been his whole life,

532
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,601
Every fiber
of the old fool.

533
00:34:45,602 --> 00:34:47,836
Who'd catch Big Eric
if he wasn't here?

534
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:52,274
You know that old jacket
he wears?

535
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:54,810
He only puts that on
when he's feeling fragile.

536
00:34:54,811 --> 00:34:56,378
Used to belong to Jamie.

537
00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:58,948
I can't see him
leaving here, Archie.

538
00:34:58,949 --> 00:35:01,249
Well, only in a wooden box.

539
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,619
I'm sure you'll
do what's best.

540
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:09,091
( sighs )

541
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,770
<i>Fraser:
Archie, hello.</i>

542
00:35:23,073 --> 00:35:24,940
Too busy to come
on the stalk?

543
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:30,278
Probably not
your thing anyway, eh?

544
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:49,898
( gunshot )

545
00:35:58,642 --> 00:35:59,608
( gunshot )

546
00:36:07,216 --> 00:36:08,183
( gunshot )

547
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,253
I'm sorry.

548
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:13,055
I'm sure it's the rifle

549
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:15,024
That's the problem, sir.

550
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:16,591
Duncan,

551
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,360
Take a look
at Mr. Potts' piece.

552
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,697
<i>( car approaching )</i>

553
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,236
<i>( door slams )</i>

554
00:36:29,405 --> 00:36:30,839
Good morning,
gentlemen.

555
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,075
Welcome to Glenbogle.
Archie MacDonald.

556
00:36:34,477 --> 00:36:36,545
I hope you won't mind
if I join you?

557
00:36:36,546 --> 00:36:38,681
I know you're in very good
hands with old Robbie here,

558
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:40,348
But, I think
the Laird himself,

559
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:42,117
Ought to escort such
very important guests.

560
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:44,687
- You don't mind, do you, Robbie?
- No.

561
00:36:46,222 --> 00:36:47,923
Of course not, Archie.

562
00:36:47,924 --> 00:36:49,391
<i>Golly:
Right then, gentlemen,</i>

563
00:36:49,392 --> 00:36:50,959
Let's go stalking.

564
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,554
Archie: So you and Mr.
Andersson are chums, are you?

565
00:37:19,555 --> 00:37:22,257
Mr. Potts: Met in a
balloon, over the Serengeti.

566
00:37:22,258 --> 00:37:24,559
You know, one
of these luxury safaris.

567
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,995
He's a quiet chap,
but he's canny with it.

568
00:37:28,865 --> 00:37:30,699
Archie: You're in
business together then?

569
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,900
Sort of.

570
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:34,002
Made his cash
in flat-pack furniture.

571
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:35,771
I made my pile in pies.

572
00:37:35,772 --> 00:37:37,106
What?

573
00:37:37,107 --> 00:37:38,741
Anything on four legs,
we'd kill it,

574
00:37:38,742 --> 00:37:40,843
Mince it, put puff pastry
round it.

575
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:44,213
Well, we used to.
Co-op just bought us up.

576
00:37:44,214 --> 00:37:45,413
Oh.

577
00:37:45,414 --> 00:37:47,449
So we're launching this
joint venture, you know.

578
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,651
He's into this shooting lark,
so we thought we'd come up here

579
00:37:49,652 --> 00:37:51,186
And see if we could
get something going.

580
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:52,221
How exciting.

581
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,961
Right, gentlemen.

582
00:37:58,962 --> 00:38:01,130
We're about to
come up to the beasts,

583
00:38:01,131 --> 00:38:02,564
<i>So keep low</i>

584
00:38:02,565 --> 00:38:05,267
<i>And don't even fart unless
I give you permission.</i>

585
00:38:05,268 --> 00:38:07,269
Okay?

586
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:36,832
I do hope old Robbie's
given you every assistance?

587
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:39,467
Oh, Robbie couldn't have
done more, he really couldn't.

588
00:38:39,468 --> 00:38:40,903
Good.

589
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:43,138
Well, when we get back
we'll have to, er,

590
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:44,572
Talk figures.

591
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:46,308
See how your bid

592
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:48,210
Matches up to the one
we've already received.

593
00:38:48,211 --> 00:38:50,179
Other bid?

594
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,114
Robbie never
mentioned that.

595
00:38:52,115 --> 00:38:54,016
He said we'd got
a clear run.

596
00:38:54,017 --> 00:38:55,150
Quiet!

597
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:57,452
Right, Mr. Potts.

598
00:38:57,453 --> 00:38:58,987
You first.

599
00:39:05,628 --> 00:39:08,831
What the hell do you think you're doing?

600
00:39:08,832 --> 00:39:10,665
Working out
your little game.

601
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:13,001
I've got it, too.

602
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:15,337
How much of a finder's fee
were you promised, eh?

603
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,773
You're sacked.

604
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:20,442
We'll see
about that.

605
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:22,911
Your father will
never allow it.

606
00:39:22,912 --> 00:39:25,447
He trusts me-
not you.

607
00:39:25,448 --> 00:39:28,083
By heck,
what's that?

608
00:39:28,084 --> 00:39:30,285
That, Mr. Potts,
is Big Eric.

609
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:33,055
<i>Finest stag
I've ever seen.</i>

610
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:34,857
Been saving him
these past 10 years

611
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:36,758
For young Mr. Archie
there, but

612
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:38,260
<i>What the devil-</i>

613
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:39,294
<i>You can have him.</i>

614
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:41,629
You want me
to kill him?

615
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,131
Just wait
till he turns.

616
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:45,467
<i>And remember
to line up,</i>

617
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:47,870
And keep your breathing steady.

618
00:39:47,871 --> 00:39:50,005
That's it,
my friend.

619
00:39:50,006 --> 00:39:52,207
( cans rattling )

620
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:54,142
What's going on?

621
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:56,078
You're not
welcome here.

622
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,312
<i>Get off our land!</i>

623
00:39:57,313 --> 00:40:00,148
Glenbogle's for the people
who live in it,

624
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:03,618
Not absentee feudal landlords
to play with pop-guns.

625
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:06,588
<i>We demand to be heard.</i>

626
00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:08,857
We demand a voice!

627
00:40:08,858 --> 00:40:11,659
<i>That's the last thing
you need, pet.</i>

628
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,928
Well, gentlemen,

629
00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:15,330
<i>That would appear
to be that,</i>

630
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:17,332
For today.

631
00:40:28,411 --> 00:40:30,312
( brakes screech, tires squeal )

632
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:41,223
Hector.

633
00:40:41,224 --> 00:40:43,525
Um... I'm afraid I have
to raise a rather...

634
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:45,427
Painful issue.

635
00:40:45,428 --> 00:40:46,761
Oh, son and heir.

636
00:40:46,762 --> 00:40:48,931
Father, I've just
sacked Fraser here.

637
00:40:48,932 --> 00:40:51,033
- I'm not talking to you.
- He's crooked.

638
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:53,235
He's been robbing you blind
since the day he got here.

639
00:40:53,236 --> 00:40:54,702
I'm sorry about
all this, Hector.

640
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:56,171
<i>Hector:
You're sorry, Robbie?</i>

641
00:40:56,172 --> 00:40:58,673
You can't make
that kind of accusation.

642
00:40:58,674 --> 00:41:00,075
I can if it's true.

643
00:41:00,076 --> 00:41:01,709
<i>Archie seems
to have rather a...</i>

644
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,511
Chip on his shoulder-

645
00:41:03,512 --> 00:41:04,679
About me.

646
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,448
I see.

647
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:08,984
Well, Archie, let me say,

648
00:41:08,985 --> 00:41:11,119
That Robbie here is a friend
as well as an employee.

649
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,620
I trust him completely.

650
00:41:12,621 --> 00:41:15,890
Once upon a time, you might have
fulfilled that function,

651
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:18,427
But you chose to turn your back
on your responsibilities.

652
00:41:18,428 --> 00:41:20,662
<i>I had to look for help
elsewhere.</i>

653
00:41:20,663 --> 00:41:22,230
Thank you, Hector.

654
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:26,335
He's behind the theft
of those osprey eggs.

655
00:41:26,336 --> 00:41:28,337
Oh, don't be silly.

656
00:41:28,338 --> 00:41:30,472
He's always waxing lyrical
about the wretched things.

657
00:41:30,473 --> 00:41:32,207
Goodness knows why.

658
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:34,242
<i>They catch more salmon
than Golly and me put together.</i>

659
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:38,746
He's also planning to sell
the place behind your back.

660
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:40,449
What?!

661
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,518
Sweet-talking two
millionaires. Encouraging a bid,

662
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:45,487
Just one bid mind,
no competition.

663
00:41:45,488 --> 00:41:47,555
And at a knock-down price,
I should think.

664
00:41:47,556 --> 00:41:50,492
<i>- No.
- And getting a sweetener, too.</i>

665
00:41:50,493 --> 00:41:52,861
How much is it?
Two-fifty, half a million?

666
00:41:52,862 --> 00:41:54,096
( chuckling )

667
00:41:56,799 --> 00:41:58,433
He's got no proof,
Hector.

668
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:01,669
He's barmy.

669
00:42:04,707 --> 00:42:05,940
He hates you.

670
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,444
Who are you gonna believe,
father?

671
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:15,117
Pack your bags and get out.

672
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:16,118
Hector-

673
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:18,120
<i>He's my son.</i>

674
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:20,155
I don't think my son
would tell me lies.

675
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:35,904
This place is finished.

676
00:42:35,905 --> 00:42:37,805
And you with it.

677
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:48,083
I'm sorry, I know you were fond of him.

678
00:42:48,084 --> 00:42:50,118
Yes.

679
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:53,455
Still- one must look
on the bright side.

680
00:42:53,456 --> 00:42:55,790
And which bright side
would that be?

681
00:42:57,026 --> 00:42:58,493
Well, it just puts a-

682
00:42:58,494 --> 00:43:00,362
Rather different gloss
on things, doesn't it?

683
00:43:00,363 --> 00:43:01,563
<i>How do you mean?</i>

684
00:43:01,564 --> 00:43:03,865
If an honest man
had been in charge,

685
00:43:03,866 --> 00:43:06,834
A good man,
like you for instance,

686
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:09,971
We'd never have got into this
mess in the first place, would we?

687
00:43:09,972 --> 00:43:11,373
Father, you-

688
00:43:11,374 --> 00:43:12,807
<i>You've-</i>

689
00:43:13,876 --> 00:43:15,477
Oh, god!
Never mind.

690
00:43:15,478 --> 00:43:17,279
You'll be staying then,
I take it?

691
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,947
No! No!

692
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:39,634
Not you again.

693
00:43:39,635 --> 00:43:41,336
So, have you
sacked him yet, then?

694
00:43:41,337 --> 00:43:43,305
I helped you
with your rotten birds.

695
00:43:43,306 --> 00:43:45,907
You and your family have
a lot of ground to make up

696
00:43:45,908 --> 00:43:47,509
Before you get
my gratitude, pal.

697
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:50,078
You know, you are a
very irritating person.

698
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,080
- You know that?
- You haven't changed.

699
00:43:52,081 --> 00:43:53,681
You always
used to sulk.

700
00:43:53,682 --> 00:43:55,117
What are you
talking about?

701
00:43:55,118 --> 00:43:57,219
Primary school,
before they sent you away.

702
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,287
The little girl
you used to sit beside

703
00:43:59,288 --> 00:44:02,157
- In the big double desk.
- Eh?

704
00:44:02,158 --> 00:44:03,525
Katrina?

705
00:44:03,526 --> 00:44:05,260
Gingernut!

706
00:44:05,261 --> 00:44:07,829
Never, ever call me
that again, do you hear?

707
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:10,064
I nearly didn't
recognize you.

708
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,899
You used to have
as broad an accent

709
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,435
As the rest of us,
if I remember right.

710
00:44:13,436 --> 00:44:15,670
It's the main reason they
packed me off to boarding school.

711
00:44:15,671 --> 00:44:17,905
Can't have the son of a Laird
sounding Scottish, can we?

712
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:18,940
Don't get me
started.

713
00:44:20,243 --> 00:44:22,110
Can I tell you
what I really think?

714
00:44:23,513 --> 00:44:25,313
I think the idea

715
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:27,549
Of anybody owning all this
is obscene.

716
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:30,519
How can you buy a view, eh?

717
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,521
But if anybody's
going to own it,

718
00:44:32,522 --> 00:44:35,290
It should be the community
actually making a living here.

719
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:36,991
Oh, get real, Katrina.

720
00:44:36,992 --> 00:44:38,493
But,
in the meantime,

721
00:44:38,494 --> 00:44:41,729
Rather than some mega-rich idiot
from south of the border,

722
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,131
Better the devil you know.

723
00:44:43,132 --> 00:44:45,534
In this case,
the dashing young Laird.

724
00:44:45,535 --> 00:44:48,936
- That right?
- I don't want it.

725
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:51,039
I don't want to live
in a freezing castle

726
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,341
With my barmy father,
where the lights go off

727
00:44:53,342 --> 00:44:55,310
All the time and
the phone never works.

728
00:44:55,311 --> 00:44:57,412
I do not want
to be a Laird.

729
00:44:57,413 --> 00:44:59,648
Do you really hate it
that much?

730
00:45:01,484 --> 00:45:03,585
I was eight when I left.

731
00:45:03,586 --> 00:45:07,155
I missed it so much, it was
like having an arm cut off.

732
00:45:08,524 --> 00:45:11,125
What I'd do when I was low,
I'd phone that box,

733
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:14,829
Stand in a dark corridor
somewhere in Berkshire

734
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,465
And imagine the phone
ringing in all this silence.

735
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:19,467
All this around it,
the water, the hills.

736
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:22,737
I can still remember
the number: Glenbogle 2-4-9.

737
00:45:22,738 --> 00:45:24,906
It couldn't go on,

738
00:45:24,907 --> 00:45:27,742
I had to put a stop to that,
especially after Jamie died.

739
00:45:29,011 --> 00:45:31,979
- I have to get away, Katrina.
- Poor little Archie.

740
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,982
Don't you think other folk
have got problems, too?

741
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:37,619
There's people here,
on your land,

742
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,821
Sweating their guts out
for nothing.

743
00:45:39,822 --> 00:45:41,656
On the breadline,
some of them.

744
00:45:41,657 --> 00:45:44,359
And here you are,
master of all he surveys,

745
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,696
Whingeing on about
how terrible life is.

746
00:45:47,697 --> 00:45:49,864
What gives you
the right to expect

747
00:45:49,865 --> 00:45:51,600
Everything to be
the way you want it?

748
00:45:51,601 --> 00:45:53,101
Why don't you
just go away?

749
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:55,637
Why don't you?

750
00:45:55,638 --> 00:45:58,106
Back to your swanky restaurant

751
00:45:58,107 --> 00:45:59,874
And your beautiful girlfriend
and your-

752
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:01,876
Perfect life.

753
00:46:43,952 --> 00:46:45,086
There you are.

754
00:46:49,492 --> 00:46:51,092
Hey!

755
00:46:51,093 --> 00:46:52,727
What are
you doing?

756
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:57,432
- What do you think you're doing?
- None of your business, son.

757
00:46:57,433 --> 00:46:59,267
You can't
take this.

758
00:46:59,268 --> 00:47:00,868
It's scheduled
for removal,

759
00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:02,270
I've got the docket.

760
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,072
Who are you, anyway?

761
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:07,342
Me? I'm the-

762
00:47:07,343 --> 00:47:09,511
I'm a member
of the community here.

763
00:47:09,512 --> 00:47:11,713
And that's our phone box,
so you can take your lorry,

764
00:47:11,714 --> 00:47:13,648
Your crane and your bad
attitude and get lost.

765
00:47:13,649 --> 00:47:15,917
<i>- Okay?
- Man: Leave it, Jim.</i>

766
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:18,119
<i>That's the new Laird
you're talking to.</i>

767
00:47:43,078 --> 00:47:44,946
Justine?

768
00:47:44,947 --> 00:47:47,014
Hello, sweetheart,
it's me.

769
00:47:47,015 --> 00:47:48,750
How did the do go?

770
00:47:50,152 --> 00:47:51,319
Great.

771
00:47:53,088 --> 00:47:54,422
Yeah.

772
00:47:54,423 --> 00:47:56,758
Listen, Justine-

773
00:47:56,759 --> 00:47:58,893
I've got a bit
of a problem here.

774
00:48:00,496 --> 00:48:02,930
