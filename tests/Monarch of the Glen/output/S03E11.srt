<i>Man: The late Mr. MacDonald

5
00:00:49,404 --> 00:00:53,574
In the latest he wrote out
the bequests

00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:56,677
on separate sheets
in his own hand,

7
00:00:56,678 --> 00:01:00,180
which he was keen for you
to read yourselves.

8
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:03,049
I'll-

9
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,252

of single malt whiskeys

13
00:01:14,262 --> 00:01:18,265
he will toast our association
every St. Andrew's day. "

14
00:01:19,768 --> 00:01:21,835
That I will, Hector.

00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:24,438

21
00:01:38,152 --> 00:01:40,854
It's not a cardie,
it's a fleece.

22
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:43,256
I paid eight quid for that.

23
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:50,798
"To the estimable Alexandra,

a sacred trust to which I hope he will
adhere with every fiber of his being. "

36
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:39,212
Why is that the tricky part?

37
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:42,082
The law states

38
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,718
that to avoid the payment
of death duties,

39
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,988
<i>a period of seven years
must elapse</i>

40

of the deed of gift

to the demise of the donor.

42
00:02:52,894 --> 00:02:56,930
In this case,
seven years have not elapsed.

43
00:02:56,931 --> 00:02:59,633
I think I somehow know
what's coming.

44
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:03,169
<i>Lawyer: I would say that
you owe H.M. Treasury</i>

45
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,171
something in the region of...

�200,000.

47
00:03:09,744 --> 00:03:11,144

Oh, thank you, god.

49
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:18,218

<i>( theme music playing )</i>

51
00:04:07,134 --> 00:04:08,769
Hi.

52
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:12,739
You okay?

53
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:17,511
We must be strong, Lexie,
for the men in our lives.

54
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:19,580
I must be strong for Hector,

55
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:21,949
<i>and you must be strong
for Archie.</i>

56
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,285
- I'll try. - He may look
as if he's coping, but-

57
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:36,497
( running footsteps )

58
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:42,035
- What do we do now, Lexie?
- Duncan, shh.

59
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:43,704
It's all right.

60
00:04:43,705 --> 00:04:46,640
Thank you all so much
for being here to welcome

61
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:48,842
<i>Hector home
for the last time.</i>

62
00:04:48,843 --> 00:04:50,944
- Least we can do, old girl.
- Thank you, Joe.

63
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:55,048
But Duncan's question is a
good one. What do we do now?

64
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:58,118
Well, there's an easy
answer to that.

65
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:00,621
The king is dead;

66
00:05:00,622 --> 00:05:02,623
long live the king.

67
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:04,992
<i>Archie, darling,
we'll mourn your father</i>

68
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:07,060
and show him every respect

69
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,262
but you must go ahead
with your plans

70
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:11,865
to make Glenbogle
a great place once more.

71
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:14,768
<i>That's the best memorial
your father could ever have.</i>

72
00:05:16,137 --> 00:05:19,606
But I also think you should
go ahead with the wedding.

73
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:22,308
There's been death, yes,
but there's also love.

74
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:25,145
Molly, I don't think
it's right.

75
00:05:25,146 --> 00:05:27,848
No. you're right, mother.

76
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:30,951
We must go ahead
as planned.

77
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,623
<i>Lexie: So... this is where he died?</i>

78
00:05:36,624 --> 00:05:39,760
Hadn't seen it
up till now.

79
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:41,361
Kind of wish
I hadn't.

80
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:45,966
It's ugly,
isn't it?

81
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:48,702
The minister phoned.

82
00:05:48,703 --> 00:05:50,604
He's gonna come
round and see us.

83
00:05:52,941 --> 00:05:54,340
You okay?

84
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:56,409
Yeah, I'm fine.

85
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,078
You?

86
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:02,248
<i>It just doesn't
seem right, does it?</i>

87
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:03,984
Getting married?

88
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:06,152
Just a couple of days
after Hector-

89
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:09,322
getting married
is the one certainty,

90
00:06:09,323 --> 00:06:10,924
the one good thing
that we have.

91
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:12,893
You take that away and...

92
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:14,695
okay.

93
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:17,097
<i>I understand.</i>

94
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:19,666
I better get going.

95
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,835
<i>You coming?</i>

96
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:23,770
There's something
I have to do first.

97
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,794
I don't really want
to wear black to the funeral.

98
00:06:47,795 --> 00:06:50,831
I suppose...

99
00:06:50,832 --> 00:06:52,432
I could wear this.

100
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:55,669
Is there anything
I can do in the interim?

101
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,371
You could look after Pammy,
Lexie's mother.

102
00:06:58,372 --> 00:07:01,808
She's a bit forlorn and I'm not
sure I can cope with her just now.

103
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:04,678
Still when you're
spectacularly rich,

104
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:07,547
you can be as forlorn
as you like.

105
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:10,751
Leave it to me, Molly.
I'll take care of Pammy.

106
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:15,355
Went to London,

107
00:07:15,356 --> 00:07:19,059
did some serious damage
to Eric's credit card.

108
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,227
Got this.
Shantung silk.

109
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:22,996
<i>Feel that.
And this.</i>

110
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:24,731
Is that not
a gorgeous color?

111
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:28,268
<i>And I don't know.
Hat or hair piece?</i>

112
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:30,837
I can't decide.
What do you think?

113
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:33,140
Uh...
simple is good, mum.

114
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:35,475
As restrained
as you can manage.

115
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:37,577
Never mind me.
What are you wearing?

116
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:40,647
I don't know. Haven't
even thought about it.

117
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:43,150
I won't be going out
and buying anything new,

118
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:45,251
now that Archie's broke.

119
00:07:45,252 --> 00:07:47,921
Let me buy your frock. Let
me take care of everything.

120
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:51,291
- That's what mothers are for.
- Okay, thanks, mum.

121
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:54,995
What do you think-

122
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:57,030
what do you think
about that?

123
00:07:57,031 --> 00:07:59,066
You're not going to wear
that though, are you?

124
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:00,867
Yeah.
What's wrong with it?

125
00:08:00,868 --> 00:08:04,037
You don't think it's a wee bit
on the gloomy side?

126
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:06,439
It's for the funeral, mum,

127
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,109
<i>- not the wedding.
- Very nice.</i>

128
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:12,445
<i>( clock chiming )</i>

129
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:14,681
Lexie: I just thought I would cook-

130
00:08:14,682 --> 00:08:16,717
it's just some
tomato soup.

131
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:19,119
Just to keep everyone's
strength up.

132
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:23,023
Where's Archie?

133
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:26,259
He just had to go and
sort something out.

134
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,128
<i>Duncan:
This is great though.</i>

135
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:33,100
- Molly?
- I'm not really very hungry dear.

136
00:08:35,837 --> 00:08:38,205
It smells absolutely
delicious.

137
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:41,574
<i>But somehow,
I don't know,</i>

138
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:44,677
it doesn't seem
quite right to eat it.

139
00:08:44,678 --> 00:08:47,714
Pamela, if we're
to be pals,

140
00:08:47,715 --> 00:08:50,383
I think you should know
that Noel Coward

141
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:52,385
was my absolute hero.

142
00:08:52,386 --> 00:08:54,955
<i>Towards the end
of his life</i>

143
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:57,523
<i>he was sitting
with his special friend,</i>

144
00:08:57,524 --> 00:09:00,627
it was after dinner, they
were gazing out over the med,

145
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:02,896
<i>and they were
talking about</i>

146
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:05,132
<i>what would happen
if one of them died,</i>

147
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:08,235
<i>how would the other cope.</i>

148
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:11,471
And his friend said, "well,
supposing I should die tonight?

149
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:14,674
What would happen in the morning?
Would you take breakfast?"

150
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:18,745
<i>And Coward ruminated
for a moment,</i>

151
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:21,782
and he said,
"breakfast, probably not.

152
00:09:21,783 --> 00:09:23,984
But I think I'd be

153
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:26,052
pretty damned peckish

154
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:28,789

00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:36,163
Do you know, Joe,
that's really rather good.

157
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:41,634

164
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:46,032
A vigil.

165
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:47,567
Mind if I join you?

166
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:49,836

<i>Oh, dear.</i>

168
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:14,995
Do you know how I came
to work here, Molly?

169
00:11:14,996 --> 00:11:17,530
It was a family thing,
wasn't it?

170
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:21,034
<i>Your father worked here, and
his father before him and so on.</i>

171
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:23,503
No. Hector...

172
00:11:23,504 --> 00:11:25,638
didn't tell you
the story?

173
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,640
No.

174
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:32,178
To begin with,

175
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:34,847
when I was a boy,

176
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:37,617
I was a bit of a tearaway.

177
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:41,521
- Really?
- Didn't get on with dad-

178
00:11:41,522 --> 00:11:44,524
a hard, unbending man.

179
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:48,528
Used to knock me about,
especially when the drink was on.

180
00:11:51,032 --> 00:11:54,301
Anyway, when I left school,

181
00:11:54,302 --> 00:11:55,868
he got me a place here,

182
00:11:55,869 --> 00:11:59,339
but I didn't want that.

183
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,842
Under his thumb,
under his fist all day.

184
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:06,313
<i>So, what I did is,</i>

185
00:12:06,314 --> 00:12:09,615
I took a silver tankard
from the dining room.

186
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:13,719
I hid it in my bedroom
so that-

187
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,057
well, I made sure that-
my father would find it.

188
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:22,095
And haul me up in front
of Hector's dad,

189
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:24,530
which he did.

190
00:12:24,531 --> 00:12:26,799
And I got the push.

191
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:30,837
Then my father kicked me out.

192
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:35,908
So I was disgraced, but...

193
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:39,045
I was free of him.

194
00:12:39,046 --> 00:12:41,747
So, how...?

195
00:12:41,748 --> 00:12:43,783
After I caravanned,

196
00:12:43,784 --> 00:12:45,785
worked on the roads,

197
00:12:45,786 --> 00:12:49,322
I took to the bottle
big time.

198
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:51,424
I was a mess.

199
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:56,229
Meanwhile Hector's dad
pegged out,

200
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,765
so Hector became
the laird.

201
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:04,570
And then my father went.

202
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:08,908
He was carrying
a stag he'd shot.

203
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:12,879
He just collapsed.

204
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,348
Heart attack.

205
00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:18,151
Dead before he
hit the heather.

206
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:25,225
Anyway, at the funeral,

207
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:30,363
Hector offered me
my dad's job.

208
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:33,633
Me.

209
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:36,936
A thief,

210
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:39,339
an outcast.

211
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:44,077
See, he knew, Molly,

212
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:45,878
he knew.

213
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:51,551
I don't think I'd be here
now if he hadn't done that.

214
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,388
He saved my life.

215
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:02,462
Underneath all
that daftness-

216
00:14:04,065 --> 00:14:06,166
he was a great man.

217
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:13,873
I'm so sorry
I wasn't with him.

218
00:14:18,345 --> 00:14:21,647
I'll be sorry
till the end of my days.

219
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:32,959

221
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:37,564
Look at the state
of you.

222
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:41,267
So have you fallen
down the chimney?

223
00:14:41,268 --> 00:14:43,002
I'm sorry about
the minister.

224
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:45,004
I got a bit
carried away.

225
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:48,040
Is it all done?

226
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,875
Archie, look,

227
00:14:49,876 --> 00:14:52,345
- your hands.
- I'm okay.

228
00:14:52,346 --> 00:14:54,114
Are you sure?

229
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:59,419
What were you
doing up there?

230
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,988
Were you filling in a hole
or burying your feelings?

231
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:08,261
I'll be fine.

232
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:11,897
After tomorrow,
the funeral,

233
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:15,735
and then we can get on
with the rest of our lives-

234
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:17,737
<i>and the wedding.</i>

235
00:15:17,738 --> 00:15:20,673
- Archie, are you sure?
- Absolutely, utterly.

236
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:26,946
How are you coping
with your mother?

237
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:30,216
Well, she's still
set on the page boys.

238
00:15:30,217 --> 00:15:33,119
I had to put my foot down
at the symphony orchestra.

239
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,721
Spoilsport.

240
00:15:35,722 --> 00:15:38,891
It kind of feels as if she's
getting married and not me.

241
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:47,099
I love you.

242
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:02,114
I hope it's better than that
blended muck in the library.

243
00:16:02,115 --> 00:16:05,251
I didn't notice you complain
when you finished the bottle.

244
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:06,619
- Now, look here-
- shh!

245
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:10,156
Shh.

246
00:16:12,726 --> 00:16:14,794
Hector kept this

247
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:17,797
for very special
occasions.

248
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:25,572

'tis highland park!

249
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:28,140
Orkney, '52.

250
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:30,310
I remember we had a nip
when that ghastly

251
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:32,144
Thatcher woman
was blackballed.

252
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:33,680
You're not
suggesting...?

253
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:35,615
Nobody else
knows about it.

254
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:39,151
Poor old Hector
can't exactly...

255
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:42,121
perhaps if we drink
to his honor.

256
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:45,525
Yes, that's it.

257
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,793
<i>We're drinking it
for him really.</i>

258
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:50,563
Yes, it'll spare me
a tryst with Pamela,

259
00:16:50,564 --> 00:16:52,732
the cook's wealthy mater.

260
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:54,867
Now you've got me
confused.

261
00:16:54,868 --> 00:16:58,271
I thought you were mounting an
expeditionary force on that front.

262
00:16:58,272 --> 00:17:01,274
Perhaps I am. But it's been
a guiding principle of my life

263
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:04,344
always to put
pleasure before business.

264
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:08,414
That sounds like someone else
I used to know.

265
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:11,083
Both: Hector!

266
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,663
<i>( snoring )</i>

267
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,109
So much for
my inheritance, Hector.

268
00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:24,757
This is most kind
of you.

269
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:27,993
Judging by the narrowness
of this waistline

270
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:30,963
I reckon you must have worn
these when you were about 12.

271
00:18:30,964 --> 00:18:34,500
In 1972.

272
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:36,502
Oh!

273
00:18:36,503 --> 00:18:40,139
It must have been a big rabbit
you pulled out of that hat.

274
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,109
What was it- the gig?
Children's party? panto?

275
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:48,948
I was her

in Khartoum.

00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,154
Please, don't tease.

278
00:18:55,155 --> 00:18:58,825
My head is going round
like a fairground organ.

279
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:01,828
Serves you right for standing
me up last night.

280
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:04,464
I told you I was
bringing comfort

281
00:19:04,465 --> 00:19:06,833
and succor
to my grieving sister.

282
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:09,068
Right. you were probably
under a table somewhere.

283
00:19:10,904 --> 00:19:12,905
Thank you.

284
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:14,841
Nice bod, Jolyon.

Nice manly pair
of pins.

My wee Eric, he may be rich,
but see him without his chinos,

287
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:23,182

an underfed chicken.

288
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:27,420
So next time,
Cary Grant,

289
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:31,391
make sure it's me that gets
the comfort and succor, eh?

290
00:20:06,993 --> 00:20:10,195

- ( bagpipes playing )</i>

353
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,834
Thank you.

354
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:55,707
Goodbye, my friend.

355
00:26:03,884 --> 00:26:05,751
Good dog.

356
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:30,810
<i>Archie: Thank you all
for helping Lexie and I</i>

357
00:26:30,811 --> 00:26:32,511
<i>prepare for
our special day.</i>

358
00:26:32,512 --> 00:26:35,314
<i>As you know, we only have a
few hours to get the house ready</i>

359
00:26:35,315 --> 00:26:37,283
so let's get to work.

360
00:26:37,284 --> 00:26:39,484
Any questions,
just come and see me.

361
00:26:39,485 --> 00:26:42,822
She'll make somebody a
lovely mother-in-law one day.

362
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,293
No, I told you. Luncheon's
to be served in the ballroom.

363
00:26:47,294 --> 00:26:49,829
- Yeah, but- - no
"buts. " Back you go.

364
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,097
Uh, uh, uh.
Where're you going?

365
00:26:52,098 --> 00:26:55,167
- She says- - Useless men. we
decided, didn't we, darling?

366
00:26:55,168 --> 00:26:57,569
That we should all
hogdown in the ballroom.

367
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,471
<i>No, we didn't.
You decided.</i>

368
00:26:59,472 --> 00:27:02,407
I want the reception through
there. Take it back through.

369
00:27:02,408 --> 00:27:04,944
But the ballroom
is such a nice room.

370
00:27:04,945 --> 00:27:07,146
And you know what they say,
mothers know best.

371
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:10,549
- No, my mother doesn't.
- Don't be ungracious, dearie.

372
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,418
Don't forget who's putting her
hand in her pocket for all this.

373
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:15,321
Now listen to me.
Don't you start-

374
00:27:15,322 --> 00:27:19,091
- preparations all in hand?
- Yeah, they're fine, Molly, thanks.

375
00:27:19,092 --> 00:27:22,294
Good. I'm sorry I haven't
been able to help,

376
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:24,363
but I'm not feeling...

377
00:27:24,364 --> 00:27:27,099
- do you want me to get you anything?
- No, not really.

378
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,469
It'll be lovely to hear
laughter in the house again.

379
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,172
Now... where were we?

380
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:36,175
Look, just do
what you want.

381
00:27:36,176 --> 00:27:39,411
That's what you're
going to do anyway.

382
00:27:42,548 --> 00:27:44,149
Oh, dear.

383
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,886
( sobbing )
Oh, dear.

384
00:27:46,887 --> 00:27:48,787
Hector.

385
00:27:48,788 --> 00:27:50,722
<i>( knocking )</i>

386
00:27:50,723 --> 00:27:53,359
<i>- Joe: Molly, are you in there?
- No.</i>

387
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,727
I hope you're decent
because I'm coming in.

388
00:27:55,728 --> 00:27:58,030
Go away, I haven't got my face on.

389
00:27:58,031 --> 00:28:01,666
Oh, stuff and nonsense. I'm
your little brother, remember?

390
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:04,836
- You all right, old girl?
- Yes, thanks, perfectly fine.

391
00:28:04,837 --> 00:28:07,006
Oh, Molly, Molly.

392
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:09,775
You looked after
everyone else, didn't you?

393
00:28:11,677 --> 00:28:14,313
- What about tomorrow?
- I don't know.

394
00:28:14,314 --> 00:28:17,049
I don't know.
I don't know.

395
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,618
Archie needs you,
not only for the wedding,

396
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:22,854
- but this money business.
- I know, I know.

397
00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:24,790
I just can't seem to-

398
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:26,725
get myself together.

399
00:28:26,726 --> 00:28:29,361
Rouse myself.

400
00:28:29,362 --> 00:28:31,363
That's good.

401
00:28:31,364 --> 00:28:33,265
That's very good.

402
00:28:33,266 --> 00:28:35,968
<i>Thank you.</i>

403
00:28:35,969 --> 00:28:37,769
It's not finished yet.

404
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,973
It's got something missing but
I don't quite know what it is.

405
00:28:40,974 --> 00:28:43,943
That's what you should do.
Finish the portrait.

406
00:28:43,944 --> 00:28:46,412
How's that going
to help Archie?

407
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:48,447
You leave it to me.

408
00:28:48,448 --> 00:28:51,550
I've got a beezer
of an idea.

409
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:02,894
It's always been
the same.

410
00:29:02,895 --> 00:29:05,697
No matter how hard I try
to please my wee girl,

411
00:29:05,698 --> 00:29:08,033
all I get is lip.

412
00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:10,235
I just happened to mention
I thought the cake

413
00:29:10,236 --> 00:29:12,938
was a wee bit on the small
side, and she throws me out.

414
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,376
She wouldn't even travel in
the same car up to the hotel.

415
00:29:17,377 --> 00:29:20,312
Something about there not being
enough room on my broomstick.

416
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,852
Pammy: How come you're
so good at this, anyway?

417
00:29:26,853 --> 00:29:28,988
I thought this was
a game for wee fat lugs

418
00:29:28,989 --> 00:29:31,256
called "jockey"
or "auckey" or something.

419
00:29:31,257 --> 00:29:34,059
I used to play against
my houseboy in Kenya.

420
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,029
Oh, and did you thrash him
like you're thrashing me?

421
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,297
Sadly, no.

422
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,234
So, Jolyon,
it's time for a girl

423
00:29:42,235 --> 00:29:44,569
to ask a chap about
his intentions.

424
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,805
You haven't said what
we're playing for.

425
00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:49,208
Or indeed, why you've been
trying to get me pished

426
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:51,110
for the last two hours.

427
00:29:51,111 --> 00:29:53,012
Well, Pammy,
how shall I put this?

428
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,816
I gather that
you're rather rich.

429
00:29:57,817 --> 00:29:59,418
( chuckles )

430
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:01,753
Oh, Cary,
you disappoint me.

431
00:30:01,754 --> 00:30:03,955
That's not how
it goes in the movies.

432
00:30:03,956 --> 00:30:06,992
<i>I thought you had
a wee bit more class.</i>

433
00:30:06,993 --> 00:30:10,295
No, it's not for me.
I'm ripped to the wide.

434
00:30:10,296 --> 00:30:12,164
Homeless as well
as hopeless,

435
00:30:12,165 --> 00:30:15,667
but I'm trying to help
your only daughter

436
00:30:15,668 --> 00:30:17,302
and my only nephew.

437
00:30:17,303 --> 00:30:19,304
I see.

438
00:30:19,305 --> 00:30:23,008
Willie, another vodka
in there for mother teresa.

439
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:34,719
Hello, Lexie. Joining the
local gentry, so I hear.

440
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,190
What's a poor girl to do when
you're the only alternative?

441
00:30:38,191 --> 00:30:40,259
<i>Now away and pour me
a pint of guinness.</i>

442
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,428
There's a good boy.

443
00:30:43,763 --> 00:30:47,699
- That's my girl.
- Just bluster.

444
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,669
<i>I'm really not
looking forward to this.</i>

445
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,237
Listen, Arch-

446
00:30:52,238 --> 00:30:53,872
<i>yoo-hoo!</i>

447
00:30:53,873 --> 00:30:55,541
I've got the mixers
for the cocktails.

448
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:57,509
What is your pleasure?

449
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,478
Tequila slammer?

450
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:05,117
Come on. Save all that
for tomorrow night.

451
00:31:05,118 --> 00:31:07,052
Have a good hen night.

452
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:08,753
See you tomorrow.

453
00:31:26,172 --> 00:31:28,740
Pamela?

454
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:31,810
I'm so excited and thrilled.
I've been wracking my brains

455
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:34,779
about what to give you two
sweethearts for a wedding present.

456
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,149
<i>I'm sure the old place
has got plenty of towels.</i>

457
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,284
Yep, that is one thing
we do have plenty of.

458
00:31:39,285 --> 00:31:41,620
All your problems
are over, Archie.

459
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:43,755
Call it Lexie's stake
in the family business.

460
00:31:43,756 --> 00:31:45,624
I'm sorry,
I don't quite understand.

461
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:47,226
These death duties.

462
00:31:47,227 --> 00:31:49,794
You will let me take care
of them for you, won't you?

463
00:31:49,795 --> 00:31:52,297
Pamela, that's extraordinarily
generous of you-

464
00:31:52,298 --> 00:31:54,966
no problem. We can easily
afford it, Eric and me.

465
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:57,936
<i>- I appreciate that. it's-
- listen to me a wee minute.</i>

466
00:31:57,937 --> 00:31:59,838
You know that things
haven't always

467
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,806
been so good between
Lexie and me.

468
00:32:01,807 --> 00:32:06,111
<i>Just like they were
with you and your daddy.</i>

469
00:32:06,112 --> 00:32:09,248
I'd like to make amends...
before it's too late.

470
00:32:09,249 --> 00:32:11,750
<i>You get me?
Besides...</i>

471
00:32:11,751 --> 00:32:13,452
it would give you
a proper start.

472
00:32:13,453 --> 00:32:16,921
I just want my wee girl to be
happy, that's all I care about.

473
00:32:16,922 --> 00:32:20,659
<i>So, what
do you say?</i>

474
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,562
Well, what can I say?

475
00:32:23,563 --> 00:32:24,863
I accept.

476
00:32:32,438 --> 00:32:36,642
This is lovely, Lex. It reminds
me so much of my own wedding.

477
00:32:36,643 --> 00:32:38,644
Which one?

478
00:32:38,645 --> 00:32:42,181
The first- the best,
your daddy.

479
00:32:42,182 --> 00:32:45,083
Oh, I know it all went a
wee bit pear-shaped later on,

480
00:32:45,084 --> 00:32:47,619
but, see when
he wedded me

481
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:51,657
and then bedded me,
it was fantastic.

482
00:32:51,658 --> 00:32:53,858
What we had,
your daddy and me,

483
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:57,028
it gleamed and shone,
like my new pearls here.

484
00:32:57,029 --> 00:33:00,765
That's funny, I don't quite
remember it like that.

485
00:33:00,766 --> 00:33:03,202
No, well, the shine
did go.

486
00:33:03,203 --> 00:33:06,471
And back then,
the pearls were fake.

487
00:33:06,472 --> 00:33:08,440
And I'm sorry,
pet lamb.

488
00:33:08,441 --> 00:33:10,942
I know it was no picnic
for you growing up.

489
00:33:10,943 --> 00:33:14,079
I'm sorry
for you too, mum.

490
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,780
I really am.

491
00:33:15,781 --> 00:33:19,851
And I'm sorry I've been a bit
snippy in the past few days.

492
00:33:19,852 --> 00:33:21,986
Just been worried sick.

493
00:33:21,987 --> 00:33:24,556
- Mostly about Archie.
- Why, darling?

494
00:33:24,557 --> 00:33:29,961
Because I know behind that
brave face he's in a bad way.

495
00:33:29,962 --> 00:33:34,799
About Hector, and there's
these death duties now.

496
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:44,843
- What?
- Nothing.

497
00:33:44,844 --> 00:33:47,312
- What?
- It's a surprise.

498
00:33:51,484 --> 00:33:53,952
Oh, buttonholes,
got to get buttonholes.

499
00:33:55,988 --> 00:33:58,990
- Lexie...?
- Your little secret's out.

500
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:02,561
She just couldn't help
herself, could she?

501
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:05,264
- She just had to show off.
- Look, I can explain-

502
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:08,066
you don't need to explain anything
to me about my mother, Arch.

503
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:09,768
I know all
there is to know.

504
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:12,237
And I know what this
stunt is all about.

505
00:34:12,238 --> 00:34:14,773
She's trying to control
my life.

506
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:16,074
The way it's always been.

507
00:34:16,075 --> 00:34:17,842
I'm sure she's not
trying to do that.

508
00:34:17,843 --> 00:34:21,346
Arch, you're thinking
like a tree stump.

509
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:23,482
You don't know her
like I know her.

510
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:28,453
Give her one inch, and she's
like a puma in a parrot house.

511
00:34:28,454 --> 00:34:31,923
- I thought it would be good for both of you.
- Well, you were wrong.

512
00:34:31,924 --> 00:34:34,726
Look... in any case,

513
00:34:34,727 --> 00:34:39,063
this marriage isn't
about me and my mother.

514
00:34:39,064 --> 00:34:41,833
And it's not about

515
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:44,569
trying to ease Molly's pain,
or your guilt-

516
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,905
as much
as I'd like that-

517
00:34:46,906 --> 00:34:50,709
but it's about
me and you,

518
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,844
and the feelings
we have for each other.

519
00:34:52,845 --> 00:34:55,380
I don't feel guilt
about my father.

520
00:34:55,381 --> 00:34:58,082
No?

521
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:00,919
Then tell me,

522
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,955
tell me what
is going on in here.

523
00:35:03,956 --> 00:35:05,324
'Cause it seems to me

524
00:35:05,325 --> 00:35:08,593
the Archie I know
and I love,

525
00:35:08,594 --> 00:35:10,228
is in real pain.

526
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,671
<i>Things were-</i>

527
00:35:19,672 --> 00:35:23,241
things were very bad
between us when he went.

528
00:35:23,242 --> 00:35:26,645
<i>As bad as they
had ever been.</i>

529
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:30,114
I always felt like I was
a disappointment to him.

530
00:35:30,115 --> 00:35:33,552
Jamie was the golden boy
and I-

531
00:35:33,553 --> 00:35:36,521
I wasn't.

532
00:35:36,522 --> 00:35:39,290
Whatever I did,
I could never escape that.

533
00:35:42,428 --> 00:35:44,929
We said some very
bitter things

534
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,298
to each other
at the end.

535
00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:50,001
Well, I did to him.

536
00:35:51,637 --> 00:35:53,972
And I feel so bad
about that because

537
00:35:53,973 --> 00:35:57,843
I'm beginning to think
I might have misjudged him.

538
00:36:01,547 --> 00:36:04,249
There's nothing I, or anyone
else, can do about that,

539
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:07,386
except father, maybe...

540
00:36:07,387 --> 00:36:09,421
but he's not here, is he?

541
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:14,058
I wish I could do
something to help you.

542
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:16,728
You do, you do.

543
00:36:16,729 --> 00:36:19,998
I'm in the middle
of something here.

544
00:36:19,999 --> 00:36:22,300
And I'm trying to get through
to the other side.

545
00:36:22,301 --> 00:36:24,135
And I will,

546
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:26,872
because I know you're going
to be there waiting for me.

547
00:36:26,873 --> 00:36:28,940
<i>And once
we're married-</i>

548
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:31,443
see, this is what
I'm afraid of.

549
00:36:31,444 --> 00:36:34,546
<i>It's not a marriage,</i>

550
00:36:34,547 --> 00:36:37,248
it's a therapy session.

551
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:40,318
I'm the only one who's
not getting any treatment.

552
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:46,324
<i>Remember what your father
said when we told him?</i>

553
00:36:46,325 --> 00:36:47,826
His curse?

554
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:52,030
He said it would all
end in tears, didn't he?

555
00:36:52,031 --> 00:36:55,834
Well, he was right.

556
00:36:55,835 --> 00:36:58,637
<i>( Lexie sobs )</i>

557
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:05,109
Lexie, wait!

558
00:37:07,513 --> 00:37:08,780
<i>( door slams )</i>

559
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:14,152
I'm rather cross
with you.

560
00:37:14,153 --> 00:37:16,955
Rushing off like that.

561
00:37:16,956 --> 00:37:20,024
You left Archie
in rather a bad state.

562
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:23,328
The boy's lost.

563
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:25,764
What am I
going to do with him?

564
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:27,699
Or you?

565
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:37,776
I wonder...

566
00:38:30,462 --> 00:38:32,296
father...?

567
00:38:42,474 --> 00:38:44,175
Wha-?

568
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:28,119
Goodbye.

569
00:39:52,812 --> 00:39:55,146
Goodbye.

570
00:40:30,016 --> 00:40:32,651
Mother?

571
00:40:32,652 --> 00:40:35,887
Morning, Archie.
How are you today?

572
00:40:35,888 --> 00:40:38,056
Fine, fine.

573
00:40:38,057 --> 00:40:40,458
- It's just that...
- do you like your rose?

574
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:42,961
Yes.

575
00:40:47,232 --> 00:40:49,701
- You've got one too?
- Of course.

576
00:40:49,702 --> 00:40:52,871
You better get ready
because there's a job

577
00:40:52,872 --> 00:40:54,873
I want you to do before
we leave for the church.

578
00:40:56,475 --> 00:40:58,609
Is something wrong?

579
00:41:07,086 --> 00:41:11,956
No...
no, I don't think so.

580
00:41:16,628 --> 00:41:18,563
Archie:
Is he straight?

581
00:41:18,564 --> 00:41:22,366
As much as he ever was.
Leaning to the right.

582
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:24,703
<i>Ditto.</i>

583
00:41:24,704 --> 00:41:26,204
<i>That's it.</i>

584
00:41:26,205 --> 00:41:28,773
You've got him
just fine, Molly.

585
00:41:30,342 --> 00:41:32,877
His eyes follow you
everywhere.

586
00:41:32,878 --> 00:41:35,080
Have you noticed?

587
00:41:35,081 --> 00:41:37,182
I'm glad you did it
with a smile on his face.

588
00:41:37,183 --> 00:41:39,884
Wouldn't want him glowering
at me for the rest of my life.

589
00:41:39,885 --> 00:41:41,786
He'll always be smiling
on you, Archie.

590
00:41:41,787 --> 00:41:46,490
Time we were off.
Are you ready?

591
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:49,393
Yes, mother,
I think I am.

592
00:41:55,801 --> 00:41:58,069
You look
fan-dabby-dozy.

593
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,438
Cheer up,
it might never happen.

594
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:02,573
I feel terrible.

595
00:42:02,574 --> 00:42:05,276
- Why, darling?
- What I said to Archie,

596
00:42:05,277 --> 00:42:09,013
after all he's been through,
he really needed me there.

597
00:42:09,014 --> 00:42:11,482
I just let him down.

598
00:42:11,483 --> 00:42:14,185
That boy's tougher than
he looks, mark my words.

599
00:42:15,621 --> 00:42:18,223
Mum, could you just leave
me alone for a minute?

600
00:42:18,224 --> 00:42:21,259
I just want to get
my head together.

601
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,261
I'll come "zhoosh" you
in a bit.

602
00:42:23,262 --> 00:42:25,296
Okay.

603
00:42:25,297 --> 00:42:27,165
Should I bring your
bait and bap?

604
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:28,800
No.

605
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:37,675
( sighs )

606
00:42:43,315 --> 00:42:45,817
( whispers )
Courage.

607
00:42:48,053 --> 00:42:51,790
Molly, I think you'll find I've
sorted everything out for Archie.

608
00:42:51,791 --> 00:42:54,625
Have you, Joe?
How clever of you.

609
00:42:54,626 --> 00:42:57,528
But he'll just have to
struggle along in my absence.

610
00:42:57,529 --> 00:42:59,630
Why? where
are you going?

611
00:42:59,631 --> 00:43:02,801
Pamela has asked me
to stay with her and Eric.

612
00:43:02,802 --> 00:43:06,104
<i>They have a luxury
bungalow outside Glasgow.</i>

613
00:43:13,345 --> 00:43:15,513
( rings )

614
00:43:15,514 --> 00:43:17,882
Where's the bride?
I'm throwing her away.

615
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:20,751
Duncan, have you seen Lexie?
I can't find her anywhere.

616
00:43:20,752 --> 00:43:22,753
That's 'cause
she's not here.

617
00:43:22,754 --> 00:43:25,890
- ( in unison ) what?
- I just saw her get on the bus.

618
00:43:37,569 --> 00:43:40,438
Let's face it,
Archie,

619
00:43:40,439 --> 00:43:43,374
she always has had
a tendency to overcook things.

620
00:43:49,715 --> 00:43:51,682
- Archie!
- It's Lexie.

621
00:43:51,683 --> 00:43:53,251
She's done a runner.

622
00:43:53,252 --> 00:43:54,618
Right!

623
00:44:07,733 --> 00:44:10,768
Pamela:
Archie, you drive.

624
00:44:10,769 --> 00:44:13,104
Kilwillie:
Get in here. ooh!

625
00:44:18,577 --> 00:44:20,311
Golly: On, laddy!

626
00:44:29,821 --> 00:44:33,624
Come on, Archibald,
push the pedal to the metal.

627
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:36,660
- She got a good start.
- Where is she running to?

628
00:44:36,661 --> 00:44:39,530
- Probably to my sister's in Dundee.
- She must be desperate.

629
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:43,401
Kilwillie:
Holy moses!

630
00:44:54,546 --> 00:44:59,417
Please come on, we're late.
Make tracks!

631
00:45:17,769 --> 00:45:20,638
Oh, Archie.

632
00:45:27,112 --> 00:45:28,879
Kilwillie:
Drive, drive!

633
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,448
Molly: Not too fast. Not too fast!

634
00:45:32,084 --> 00:45:34,118
- Golly: On, laddy!
- Duncan: Whoa!

635
00:45:37,889 --> 00:45:39,991
( Golly chuckles )

636
00:45:46,966 --> 00:45:49,733
There she comes!

637
00:45:49,734 --> 00:45:51,970
Come on, Arch.
You've got to do it!

638
00:45:54,206 --> 00:45:56,341
Kilwillie:
There she is.

639
00:45:57,676 --> 00:46:00,044
( all scream )

640
00:46:00,045 --> 00:46:02,813
- What are you doing?
- Archie, mind my Cadillac!

641
00:46:02,814 --> 00:46:04,682
I know what
I'm doing.

642
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:08,219
<i>Duncan:
Oh, no, the bus.</i>

643
00:46:11,957 --> 00:46:13,858
Driver:
What the-?

644
00:46:22,701 --> 00:46:25,303
Hi... hello.

645
00:46:25,304 --> 00:46:27,571
<i>Hi.</i>

646
00:46:32,378 --> 00:46:34,278
<i>Archie: Trying to dodge your fare, eh?</i>

647
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,685
- Archie- - I'm not going
to take your mother's money.

648
00:46:41,686 --> 00:46:44,555
I don't know what we'll do,
but we'll do it together.

649
00:46:44,556 --> 00:46:48,726
And as for the wedding, you were right
- wrong time, wrong place.

650
00:46:48,727 --> 00:46:51,195
When we do get married

651
00:46:51,196 --> 00:46:54,399
there'll be no
clouds in the sky.

652
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,635
And the only feelings
will be joy and serenity

653
00:46:57,636 --> 00:47:00,505
and a certainty that
everything is gonna be okay.

654
00:47:02,474 --> 00:47:05,376
I love you to bits, Lex.

655
00:47:07,646 --> 00:47:10,248
Will you marry me?

656
00:47:11,316 --> 00:47:13,451
I've got
very cold feet.

657
00:47:13,452 --> 00:47:16,687
- I'll warm them up for you.
- You're not ready for this.

658
00:47:16,688 --> 00:47:18,789
I am.

659
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:20,658
Archie,

660
00:47:20,659 --> 00:47:24,362
if I agreed, I wouldn't
just be marrying you,

661
00:47:24,363 --> 00:47:27,498
I'd be marrying
a dozen other people.

662
00:47:27,499 --> 00:47:30,034
Whatever makes you
say that?

663
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,709
Look, Lex, you don't
have to decide now,

664
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,644
<i>but just
come with me.</i>

665
00:47:40,645 --> 00:47:43,147
Come home.

666
00:47:54,326 --> 00:47:56,760
Do you not see?

667
00:47:57,829 --> 00:48:00,030
I got a return ticket.

668
00:48:02,134 --> 00:48:04,135

669
00:48:04,136 --> 00:48:05,903
