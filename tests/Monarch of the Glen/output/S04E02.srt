1
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,331
- Do you want a lift?
- Yeah, thanks.

2
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:40,972
I'm Duncan.
I work with wolves.

3
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>- What's your name?
- Esme.</i>

4
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,078
As in
"is my tea ready?"

5
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,846
No, as in the old
french word for love.

6
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:50,848
Right.

7
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:54,619
Thanks.

8
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:05,863
Oh, very smart.

9
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,371
This could do
with a dusting.

10
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:16,508
- Not my job.
- It is your job. I should know.

11
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,943
The wolf center opens
the day after tomorrow.

12
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:21,646
Either I run the catering
business or I polish tables.

13
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:23,982
<i>If you want me to do both,
I'll need help.</i>

14
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,318
What do you want me to do,
wave my magic wand?

15
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,186
<i>- Duncan: Lexie!
- What?</i>

16
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:31,055
Got any jobs going?

17
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:33,257
Hi, I'm Esme.

18
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,061
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

19
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,366
<i>( door closes )</i>

20
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:18,569
Oh, what's this,
a wedding present?

21
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,638
Uh, no, no.

22
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,840
It's for my presentation
to Wildlife Scotland.

23
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:25,543
The visitors' center
and the wolf pen-

24
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:27,011
with wolves,

25
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:29,147
the wildlife trails-

26
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:31,049
this must have cost
a fair wee bit.

27
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,385
If it helps persuade them to give
us the grant, it's money well-spent.

28
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:36,754
You know what's wrong
with it, don't you?

29
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:39,623
There's no visitors.

30
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:41,326
( scoffs )
There will be.

31
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,061
<i>( knocking )</i>

32
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:48,232
You wanted to see me?

33
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:50,534
<i>Yeah, is everything
ready for the move?</i>

34
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:51,869
Ready when you are.

35
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:57,541
Lexie and I discussed it
again yesterday

36
00:02:57,542 --> 00:03:00,378
and we're going to have
to go ahead with this.

37
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:03,047
If we're going into holiday
homes then we're going need

38
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:05,716
the crofts with a view of the loch
- Duncan's and yours.

39
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:08,919
Archie, you're throwing me out of
my house, can we just get on with it?

40
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,856
- If there was any other way.
- You've made your decision.

41
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:13,291
You're the laird.

42
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,465
Don't-
Archie, watch it!

43
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:25,269
Let's hope
it's not an omen.

44
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,474
It's her or me.

45
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,609
I had no idea it was
going to be Isobel Hogg

46
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,811
assessing us for the grant
until they phoned just now.

47
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:35,980
<i>- will you just listen?
- No!</i>

48
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:38,782
Not if it has anything to do
with that ghastly woman.

49
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:40,851
You chose her
to be my godmother.

50
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:43,421
That was your father's idea.
Need I say more?

51
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:44,655
<i>Mother, please.</i>

52
00:03:44,656 --> 00:03:46,257
You know that
she's an expert

53
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:48,326
on the survival
of rare species.

54
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:51,162
She made her name studying
animals in their natural habitat.

55
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:53,264
I feel very sorry
for the animals.

56
00:03:53,265 --> 00:03:56,167
She's on the board of Wildlife
Scotland. They could give us a grant

57
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:58,969
that would completely cover
the cost of the wolf center.

58
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,972
<i>- it's a huge amount of money.
- It depends on Isobel?</i>

59
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:04,909
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.
- Then you won't need me.

60
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,878
- I'm going to Kilwillie's.
- Mother, I can't risk offending her.

61
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,582
She'll think of something. She'll go out
of her way to make life difficult for you.

62
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,922
She's not the only person
round here trying to do that.

63
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:34,172
Here, I'll take that.

64
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:37,675
Thanks.

65
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:39,843
Oh, I'm okay.
You know, I'll manage.

66
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:41,845
Excuse me.

67
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:48,919
Who's that?

68
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:52,457
Esme.
The new cleaner.

69
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,859
- Thanks for letting me know.
- Like you told me about Irene.

70
00:04:57,496 --> 00:05:00,731
<i>Look, I thought with the
opening, and visiting professors</i>

71
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:03,601
and all this moving house
stuff on your plate...

72
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:05,836
go on inside
and see Golly.

73
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:17,415
You all ready?

74
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:21,018
Archie, I've lived
25 years in this house.

75
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,954
I'm sorting something else out for you.

76
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:25,856
It could be a lot
better than this place.

77
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:28,025
Very kind of you.

78
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:30,894
But that doesn't change the way I feel
about what you've done to this estate.

79
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:34,632
You can't buy
my approval.

80
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:37,435
I'm not trying to do that.
We can't afford to stand still.

81
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:40,471
Standing still is
one thing, son.

82
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:43,207
Running before you can walk
is quite another.

83
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:56,220
<i>Archie: I used to come
up here when I was little.</i>

84
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:58,156
<i>You know, just to get
away from the house.</i>

85
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:01,825
Golly was always
here to talk to.


86
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:05,829
He was the one
sane person in my life.

87
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,567
And now he's telling me
that I'm getting it all wrong.

88
00:06:10,802 --> 00:06:12,903
And what about me?

89
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:15,072
Don't I count as sane?

90
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:17,208
Borderline.

91
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,547
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about Esme.

92
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,551
Mmm. It's not a great time
to be taking on extra staff.

93
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,653
She does know that
it's not permanent, yeah?

94
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:32,423
Yeah, she's just a student. She
just wanted a job for the holidays.

95
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:35,359
But if you're worried about
money, it's not a problem.

96
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,961
I'm paying her keep and I'm
giving her cash in hand.

97
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:41,365
Are you sure she's a student?
She's very young.

98
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:44,535
What, to someone
as old as you?

99
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:46,770
Did you ask
for references?

100
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:48,939
<i>- Archie!
- okay, I'm sorry, sorry.</i>

101
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,610
I'm sure it will be fine
once we get the center open.

102
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:55,313
I just feel like I'm
breaking a lot of eggs

103
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:58,349
to make this particular omelet.
I hope it's worth it.

104
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,750
<i>It will be.</i>

105
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,985
You know we're all
behind you, don't you?

106
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:05,155
- Mmm.
- We are.

107
00:07:05,156 --> 00:07:07,057
Now, come on.

108
00:07:07,058 --> 00:07:09,026
48 hours,
we've got a lot to do.

109
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:11,095
Plus, you've got
your fairy godmother.

110
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,130
Isobel?
She won't be a problem.

111
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:16,567
<i>Man: 10 reps, go for it! Push it!</i>

112
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:18,669
I can't!

113
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,671
I can't go on!

114
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:22,606
What's our target?

115
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:25,076
- I've told you.
- I want to hear it again.

116
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,678
To become
a little trimmer.

117
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:30,547
<i>- To lose two stone.
- Yes.</i>

118
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:32,917
And why do we need
to do this?

119
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:34,952
I can't see
the point of this.

120
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:37,755
Motivation, that's the point.
You're doing this for a reason.

121
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:41,058
- What is it?
- There's a lady of my acquaintance

122
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,861
who mentioned to me
that she could never

123
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:46,964
be attracted to someone
who was portly.

124
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:49,566
Okay, let's do
some mat work.

125
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:51,335
On your
hands and knees!

126
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:52,670
<i>( knocking )</i>

127
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:55,840
- Kilwillie?
- She can't find you here!

128
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:59,410
<i>- Kilwillie?
- The fitness suite, you, it's supposed to be a secret!</i>

129
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:01,946
- That was a condition of your employment.
- I won't say a word.

130
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:05,349
- Shhh, jump out that way, quick.
- I'll take a shower.

131
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,318
She'll hear you.

132
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,353
<i>Kilwillie: Molly!</i>

133
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:12,423
What a surprise.

134
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:14,391
Are you
quite all right?

135
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:17,394
Oh, never better.
I...

136
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:19,563
I have just
got out of bed.

137
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:21,565
I thought I heard
someone with you.

138
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:23,600
No, definitely not.

139
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:25,336
I left the shampoo
in my room.

140
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:28,940
Who's he?

141
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,774
Gavin.

142
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:32,710
Gavin?

143
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,745
My...
my friend.

144
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:39,183
- Is he staying with you?
- Yes.

145
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,287
A chap can get awfully lonely
in a big place like this.

146
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:45,323
It's wonderful
to have a companion.

147
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:50,962
Absolutely.

148

<i>( door closes )</i>

149
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,801
I don't know why Archie's
put you in together.

150
00:08:57,802 --> 00:08:59,570
It's the only spare room with heating.

151
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:02,506
And anyway, he says it's only
going to be for a couple of nights.

152
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:04,641
It still
seems so unfair.

153
00:09:04,642 --> 00:09:08,212
Archie's a man in a hurry.
I'm not sure fair comes into it.

154
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:11,782
What you lads need is
a good woman to look after you.

155
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:13,784
We've been looking.

156
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:15,452
I'm only
down the hall.

157
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,592
That's the third time
she's been in.

158
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:23,327
She fancies you.

159
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:25,930
Don't be daft.

160
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:31,168
( vacuum running )

161
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:35,973
Hi.

162
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,977
- ( vacuum turns off )
- You're making me feel guilty.

163
00:09:39,978 --> 00:09:42,546
I used to just, you know,
hoover round the furniture.

164
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:44,782
You should
meet my mother, then.

165
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:47,285
Houseproud or what?
I must have got it from her.

166
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:50,254
You should meet mine. That's why I'm here
- running away from her.

167
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,325
Not you, too?

168

<i>What happened?</i>

I don't want
to talk about it.

170

I just couldn't
stay there, that's all.

171
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:04,868
Do you have any friends around
you could go to?

172
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:07,204
I had to get right away.

173
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:08,605
You'll be
all right here.

174
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:14,278
- Oh, I gave Archie my references.
- Your references?

175
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,712
He asked me.

176
00:10:15,713 --> 00:10:17,048
Oh, did he?

177
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:20,251
Right, well, don't be
too hard on those carpets.

178
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,785
They're not used to it.

179
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:25,656
( vacuum sputters )

180
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:35,132
I thought you'd gone
to Kilwillie's.

181
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:37,268
I did, but I didn't
want to play gooseberry

182
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,237
so I ended up
going to the library.

183
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:44,008
Why the sudden interest
in those books?

184
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:47,111
Research. you know,
I sometimes feel

185
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:49,680
that I've lived rather
a sheltered life.

186
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:52,883
I mean, there's so much
to find out...

187
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:54,585
about how
the other half live.

188
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:56,354
You've lost me.

189
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,423
Never mind. I want to ask
you about Kilwillie.

190
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:02,226
- Have you ever wondered?
- Wondered what?

191
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:04,561
About him being
a man's man?

192
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:07,564
Mother, I really haven't got a
clue what you're talking about.

193
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:10,501
I'm pretty certain Kilwillie
is a friend of Dorothy's.

194
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:12,769
Dorothy his sister?

195
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,106
No, the other Dorothy.

196
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,109
Do I have
to spell it out?

197
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,012
He's batting
for the other side.

198
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,780
I mean all the clues are
there. He went to Cambridge-

199
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:27,084
like all those spies. His
marriage was a disaster

200
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:30,221
<i>and now he's picked up
this petit ami.</i>

201
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,024
Need I say more?

202
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,759
Mother, Kilwillie was
one of father's best friends.

203
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,496
No, dear, they played golf
together. That is quite different.

204
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:45,702
So, what's the nightlife
like in Glenbogle?

205
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:50,074
Oh, there's
loads going on.

206
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:53,444
There's a ceilidh in the
school hall nearly every month.

207
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:55,913
There was me thinking
the only bright lights

208
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:58,115
were the ones that went
red, amber and green.

209
00:11:58,116 --> 00:12:02,119
- ( laughing )
- I shall await my invitation.

210
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,162
What are
you waiting for?

211
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,664
She'll be here
tomorrow, Duncan.

212
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:15,599
And the day after,
I daresay.

213
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:21,772
What happened to
the advert in the paper?

214
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:23,707
I took the money
in last week.

215
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,809
They said they'd
put it on page five.

216
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,381
Nope.
It's not here.

217
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,883
Oh, I don't
believe it.

218
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:34,552
Are you sure you've
got the right week?

219
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,555
Yes, the right week,
the right month,

220
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,756
the right year,
the right paper.

221
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:43,094
I think I could
manage all that.

222
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,429
You really don't
trust me, do you?

223
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,364
Of course I do.

224
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:49,100
And how are Esme's
references, eh?

225
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,034
Were they all
up to scratch?

226
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:53,036
They were okay
as far as I could see.

227
00:12:53,037 --> 00:12:55,106
Just okay?

228
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,609
They're glowing actually.
If anything they're too good.

229
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,844
Amazing grades
in her highers.

230
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:02,879
I really can't understand
why she wants to work here.

231
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,048
That's a job for
thickies like me, eh?

232
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:08,319
Lexie, will you please
just give me a break?

233
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,387
This isn't about you.
There's just-

234
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:12,556
there's something
about Esme.

235
00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:15,226
- What?
- I'm not sure.

236
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,960
You just don't
like her, do you?

237
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:20,631
The fact that it was me
that hired her, and not you.

238
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:22,466
<i>- No.
- this morning,</i>

239
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,468
I told Golly
that he had to trust you.

240
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:26,203
<i>How can he?</i>

241
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:29,273
How can any of us,
if you don't do the same to us?

242
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:31,108
It's not a question
of trust,

243
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:34,211
it's about getting things done.
The advertisement isn't there.

244
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:36,213
Okay, I'll call
the paper.

245
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:38,149
No.

246
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,683
I'll do it.

247
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:49,260
Who do you think?
Atomic Kitten or Gail Porter?

248
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,229
Aren't you just a wee bit
too old for pinups?

249
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,298
About time you moved on
to the real thing.

250
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:57,601
Aye, well, next time
Gail drops in at Glenbogle-

251
00:13:57,602 --> 00:13:59,903
there are other women,
Duncan, proper women.

252
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:02,206
I quite like Esme.

253
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:04,175
What's stopping you?

254
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,877
Well,
I still prefer Gail.

255
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:08,445
<i>Anyway,
there's an age gap.</i>

256
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:11,782
And I work with her,
and that can be difficult.

257
00:14:11,783 --> 00:14:14,385
<i>- good night, Duncan.
- Oh, good night.</i>

258
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:17,087
- Golly.
- Irene.

259
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,827
She can't keep
away from you.

260
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:27,030
- Maybe it's you she's after.
- ( laughs )

261
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:31,068
I tell you what though,
how about a double date-

262
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:33,870
me and Esme
and you and Irene?

263
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:36,139
I'm trying to read here.

264
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,856
<i>( horn blares )</i>

265
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:01,732
Archie: Isobel!

266
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,103
- Are you Archie?
- Yes.

267
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:10,508
I think I was in London the last time you were here
- about 10 when we last met.

268
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,043
MacDonald men
never have aged well.

269
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:16,246
<i>- no problem my pitching up early?
- No, not at all.</i>

270
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:19,684
I mean, I thought when you said
9:00, you meant 9:00 tonight, but-

271
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,085
<i>I did, but I changed my mind. ( grunts )</i>

272
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:24,054
This is for you.

273
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,191
<i>Damn good thing
I knew my way here.</i>

274
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,461
You won't get many visitors if
they can't find the ruddy place.

275
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:33,798
No. Well, it's good to see you, Isobel.

276
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,767
I've prepared a presentation
about our plans for the center.

277
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:39,670
Oh, plans, huh?
Plans are all very well,

278
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:42,707
but my brief is to see if this
thing actually works or not.

279
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,743
To be blunt, several of the
trustees think you haven't got

280
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,546
a cat in hell's chance of
attracting enough visitors.

281
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,315
But I shall be able
to judge that tomorrow.

282
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,451
<i>- ( dog barks )
- Good morning, Isobel.</i>

283
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,886
- How lovely to see you.
- Don't be silly, Molly,

284
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:58,656
you can't stand me. Hector
made that clear years ago.

285
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,958
( laughs ) I wouldn't put
it quite that strongly.

286
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,193
So, how are you enjoying
being a merry widow?

287
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:05,095
I beg your pardon?

288
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:07,798
<i>I assume you've been
lining up the next victim.</i>

289
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,233
Or maybe he was there

290
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,035
<i>before Hector had
that odd accident.</i>

291
00:16:12,036 --> 00:16:14,772
<i>( Archie clears throat )</i>

292
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:19,443
- May I introduce my fiancee.
- Pleased to meet you, Isobel.

293
00:16:19,444 --> 00:16:21,846
That's Professor Hogg
until you tie the knot.

294
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,147
You look remarkably
like that girl

295
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:25,916
who used to work
in the kitchen.

296
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:28,419
Well, that's
because I am.

297
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:33,457
Oh. Well, I suppose
it's traditional

298
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,025
for lairds of Glenbogle
to lose their heads

299
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:36,326
when it comes
to choosing a wife.

300
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:39,263
Archie's the exception
that proves the rule.

301
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,931
He's made
a wonderful choice.

302
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:42,566
May I show you
to your room?

303
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,013
- Esme: Hi.
- Hi.

304
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:58,549
- This one made a run for it.
- Thanks.

305
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:04,722
Is it true you feed
rabbits to the wolves?

306
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,657
Yep.
Archie couldn't

307
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,793
find any wolves
that were vegetarian.

308
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,931
That's a joke. Their meat
comes frozen in plastic packs.

309
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:16,734
Sounds like you'd prefer
to feed them live rabbits.

310
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,936
I'd prefer not
to have them here at all.

311
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,871
<i>- why?
- I'm a ghillie, not a zoo keeper.</i>

312
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,741
Here.

313
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,244
You know about
animals, then?

314
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:29,079
A bit.

315
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,316
Working in a place like this you
can't get too sentimental about them.

316
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,684
I'm not.

317
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:37,154
It's just that sometimes
I prefer them to people.

318
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:39,857
Me, too.

319
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,859
Sometimes.

320
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,831
So, how're you
settling in?

321
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,599
Okay.

322
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,969
<i>- it has its advantages.
- You're closer to me?</i>

323
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:55,005
What's wrong?

324
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:58,241
Golly. He's like
a fish out of water

325
00:17:58,242 --> 00:18:01,044
that's sick as a parrot
and it's getting to me.

326
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:02,980
What about
an evening out?

327
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,248
<i>- would that help?
- Yeah.</i>

328
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:07,551
- Yeah, that's a great idea.
- Tonight?

329
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:10,220
- Yeah, I'll tell Golly.
- Why?

330
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:12,890
Well, he'll
need to know.

331
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,859
Won't he?

332
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,398
What are you
doing tonight?

333
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:24,234
You mean after I've thrown
your computer game in the loch?

334
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:26,036
Does that keep you awake?

335
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:28,105
No, you playing on it
keeps me awake.

336
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,941
Sorry. look,

337
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:33,477
how would you like
to go on a date?

338
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:36,346
Well, sharing a room
with you is one thing, son-

339
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:38,516
with Irene.
She sort of...

340
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:41,318
asked me
to ask you...

341
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,253
for a date.

342
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:45,856
Duncan, if I want
to ask Irene for a date

343
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:47,725
I'll talk to her myself.

344
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,528
- You can do that on the date, can't you?
- What?

345
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,696
I forgot
to ask her a time!

346
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:54,899
Duncan.

347
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:59,302
You're on-
the date tonight.

348
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:01,438
<i>- where do you want to meet?
- Up to you.</i>

349
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:04,542
- And Golly.
- Do you have to check everything with him?

350
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,343
No.

351
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:08,311
Why don't
we meet here.

352
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:11,015
- I'll be ready at 6:00.
- Great.

353
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,152
Oh!

354
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:17,454
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

355
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,091
Do you look
after the birds?

356
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:24,028
My reputation's
gone before me.

357
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,396
I mean the sea eagle.

358
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:28,866
Aye, I do.

359
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,234
Would you like to see her?

360
00:19:31,235 --> 00:19:33,136
Oh yeah,
that'd be great.

361
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:35,138
How about tonight
after work?

362
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:37,207
I'll have to check
my diary.

363
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,343
But I think it'll
be all right.

364
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:46,383
Molly,
what a surprise.

365
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:48,652
- I just had to get out of the house.
- Why?

366
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:51,589
Archie's godmother. But
let's not talk about it.

367
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,058
I know your secret.

368
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,293
Mmm, you mean my gym?

369
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:58,062
I thought
his name was Gavin.

370
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,965
No, the gymnasium
where Gavin and I work out.

371
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,033
I'd rather not
know the details.

372
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:05,302
Oh, you can join us
if you like.

373
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:08,606
- I don't think so.
- Oh, come on, have a go!

374
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,675
- Made me feel like a new man.
- And that's where Gavin came in.

375
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:13,510
Got it in one.

376
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:18,248
- Archie: Hi.
- Hi.

377
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:20,651
- How'd you get in here?
- Lexie gave me her keys.

378
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,020
Do you not want
me to clean in here.

379
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,022
I've got a couple
of calls to make.

380
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,091
- So later maybe.
- Sure.

381
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:46,176
<i>Molly: ohh!</i>

382
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:48,679
This is
the pecs machine.

383
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,681
Like
in the song.

384
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,216
If you say so. Do you
want to try the runner?

385
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:56,553
Uh, no. Kilwillie, what
do you need this for?

386
00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:59,322
There must be at least
40 miles of of private roads

387
00:20:59,323 --> 00:21:02,026
on the estate and goodness
knows how many footpaths.

388
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,827
Good point. We could go out for a jog.

389
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:05,896
That would be fun. Do you
want to come, Kilwillie?

390
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,831
Jogging outside?!
Are you mad?

391
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:11,268
I'll tell you what, Lord K, you keep
going in here and we'll step out.

392
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:13,637
Let's put you up
to 90 revs.

393
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:16,573
2k and then the whole
circuit again.

394
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:18,676
What are you
talking about?

395
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,244
- ( beeps )
- Ohh!

396
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,349
<i>Archie: Yes, but the
center's opening tomorrow</i>

397
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,585
<i>and I'm
expecting visitors.</i>

398
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:31,288
No, next week's
too late.

399
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,223
Okay.
Thank you.

400
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,226
What is it?

401
00:21:36,227 --> 00:21:39,496
Apparently it's my fault that
15 signs have been vandalized.

402
00:21:39,497 --> 00:21:41,598
Have you checked
the petty cash?

403
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,533
Uh, yeah.

404
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:44,768
Does it balance?

405
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:47,137
No, actually.

406
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:49,606
There's �50 missing.
But that's probably me-

407
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:52,375
Esme was in here on her own
and the safe door was open.

408
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:53,811
<i>She had a set
of keys.</i>

409
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,946
Yeah, I gave her mine.

410
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:59,049
Lex, you gave her
the keys to the safe.

411
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,451
This is a girl
that we know nothing about.

412
00:22:01,452 --> 00:22:04,654
- She turned up here out of
the blue- - yeah, like I did.

413
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:07,157
- It didn't make me a thief.
- This is not about you.

414
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,259
All right.
Okay, okay.

415
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,163
Let's go and ask then, or do you want to
go straight to the national crime squad?

416
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,935
<i>( Lexie clears throat )
Esme...</i>

417
00:22:19,437 --> 00:22:21,739
there's some money
missing from the safe.

418
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,007
I'm sorry?

419
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:26,509
And the laird here thinks
that you took it.

420
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,012
- I didn't say that.
- Then why are we here?

421
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:32,783
You were in the office.
The safe door was open

422
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,651
and we're missing �50.

423
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:37,888
<i>- The safe was open when I went in there.
- Archie: I don't think so.</i>

424
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,924
See, I could have left it
open. I don't always check.

425
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:42,793
We're still
missing �50.

426
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,528
Well, it wasn't me.
You can check my room.

427
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:48,365
- Okay, I'm going to clear this up.
- No, there's no need.

428
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,100
We'll take
your word for it.

429
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,277
I'm sorry.

430
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:10,420
Molly: So, how did you meet Kilwillie?

431
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:12,923
He put an advertisement
in a magazine.

432
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,792
Oh, that is so brave.

433
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,930
Kilwillie: I was beginning
to think you'd been waylaid.

434
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:23,600
Oh, no, Gavin's been telling me all
about himself. Absolutely fascinating-

435
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:26,303
all that stuff
about being a footballer.

436
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,438
He's told me one
or two things about you, too.

437
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:31,308
- What a dark horse you are.
- Am I?

438
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,710
Positive black beauty.

439
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:36,013
Anyway, I think
it's lovely.

440
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,448
In fact, I think
I'm a little bit jealous.

441
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:40,650
I could probably lend him
to you for the odd day.

442
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:43,921
( chuckles )
I- lend him?

443
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,157
I don't see how that could work.
Anyway, what would Gavin think?

444
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:49,326
A beautiful lady like you?

445
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,061
I'd be delighted.

446
00:23:52,363 --> 00:23:54,031
( laughs )

447
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:57,067
Why don't you come to supper tonight
- both of you?

448
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,336
<i>- What, Gavin?
- of course!</i>

449
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,771
Oh, we're ever so modern
at Glenbogle these days.

450
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,541
Oh, thank you.

451
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:09,412
Golly?

452
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:53,090
The wildlife trails
and the bike paths

453
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,292
already attract visitors
and we're hoping

454
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,761
that the interest generated
by the wolf center

455
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:00,964
will more than double this figure
within the first three months.

456
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:03,533
If we take the number of
visitors you have tomorrow,

457
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:07,004
that will be an accurate guide to how
many you'll have in three months time?

458
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,073
Well, tomorrow
might not be typical.

459
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:12,209
But tomorrow is the day
I'll be here.

460
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,844
I'd say if you've
done your job adequately

461
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:16,947
you should have visitors
rolling in.

462
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:20,317
There may be teething problems. I'm
sure you'll take that into account.

463
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:23,954
I hope you're not expecting any special
favors because I'm your godmother.

464
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:28,258
If we're going to pour
money into this wolf center,

465
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:30,994
I have to be certain
that it'll make a profit.

466
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:33,897
And that it will
be run competently.

467
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:35,698
It will be.

468
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:37,134
We'll see, won't we?

469
00:25:43,774 --> 00:25:46,443
So you're off to see
Esme, are you?

470
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:48,278
Aye.

471
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,680
- Where are you going?
- Off to look at the sea eagle.

472
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:53,283
And then after that,
I don't know.

473
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:55,718
It may be a good idea
to think of somewhere

474
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:58,388
<i>before you put the rest
of that perfume in your face.</i>

475
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,824
Oh, okay.

476
00:26:16,774 --> 00:26:17,874
Ooh.

477
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:20,710
<i>- Hi.
- are you ready?</i>

478
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:24,314
Me? yeah.

479
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:27,884
- Shall we go?
- Where?

480
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:30,053
- We're going out aren't we?
- Us?

481
00:26:30,054 --> 00:26:33,022
That was the general idea.
So...?

482
00:26:33,023 --> 00:26:36,393
But you're you...

483
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,596
and I'm- you know.

484
00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:42,932
Am I being really stupid

485
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:44,934
or did we make
a date this morning?

486
00:26:44,935 --> 00:26:47,304
<i>Yes.
I mean-</i>

487
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:50,807
I was really
looking forward to it.

488
00:26:50,808 --> 00:26:52,709
Really?

489
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,147
Me too!

490
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,953
So, shall we go?

491
00:27:03,954 --> 00:27:06,889
Just give me
two minutes.

492
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:13,930
<i>Duncan: Golly!</i>

493
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:18,968
- Have you seen Golly?
- No. are you ready?

494
00:27:18,969 --> 00:27:21,605
Yeah
- oh, no. look, about the sea eagle, can it wait?

495
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:24,807
- I thought you said tonight.
- I know, but I've got an emergency.

496
00:27:24,808 --> 00:27:26,876
Not a bad emergency-
a good emergency.

497
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:28,711
<i>Irene:
Duncan, what are you doing?</i>

498
00:27:28,712 --> 00:27:32,349
Look, I'm sorry. I'll show you tomorrow
- and the capercaille. sorry.

499
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,417
Oh, and if you see Golly,
can you say-

500
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:36,386
no, if you see Golly,
don't say anything.

501
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:07,950
So, what do
you want to do?

502
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:10,487
I thought the idea was
you'd show me around.

503
00:28:11,755 --> 00:28:14,090
Well, there's the-

504
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:16,025
there's the pub.

505
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:18,228
I've been to the pub.
Once was enough.

506
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,962
<i>Okay, well,
there's the...</i>

507
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:25,001
- cinema.
- There isn't a cinema.

508
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:28,305
That's where you're wrong.
It's just got here.

509
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:39,482
Tell me, how did this connection
with wildlife come about?

510
00:28:39,483 --> 00:28:43,086
- It's all in my book.
- You've written a book?

511
00:28:43,087 --> 00:28:46,423
I've written 14 books. My
autobiography, "Isobel Hogg-

512
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:50,460
a Remarkable Life," is one
of them. Molly has a copy.

513
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:53,396
I must get round
to reading it one day.

514
00:28:54,765 --> 00:28:57,400
If you look in the index
under "Alaska,"

515
00:28:57,401 --> 00:28:59,469
the first
expedition, 1959,

516
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:02,472
you'll find my groundbreaking
research on wolves,

517
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:04,507
fully dealt with that.

518
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:06,976
Fascinating.

519
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,048
Everything ready for the
great day tomorrow, Archie?

520
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:14,917
I thought it was,
but it seems

521
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:17,554
that somebody has been
trying to sabotage us.

522
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:20,657
Someone has
canceled our advertising

523
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,692
and vandalized our signs.

524
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:25,428
Who on earth
would do that?

525
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:29,566
- I wonder if Isobel might know.
- I beg your pardon.

526
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,402
<i>- I know your secret.
- ( silverware clanks )</i>

527
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,338
I saw the signs
in the back of your car.

528
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:40,543
<i>Isobel: Molly, as usual you're talking</i>

529
00:29:40,544 --> 00:29:42,879
through the well-padded
seat of your chair.

530
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,714
I saw the
vandalized signs.

531
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:47,384
I collected them for Archie.
He knows all about them.

532
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,019
You had nothing to do with
damaging them in the first place?

533
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,323
- Mother!
- Would I have told Archie if I had?

534
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,558
Classic double bluff.

535
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,460
Classic tosh!

536
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:59,862
Or should I say
vintage Molly?

537
00:30:01,265 --> 00:30:03,065
I'll take a coffee
in my room.

538
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:08,538
I have some Wildlife Scotland
work to catch up on.

539
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,810
Thank you, mother. That's made
sure we won't get the grant.

540
00:30:15,078 --> 00:30:17,414
<i>And in case
you're interested,</i>

541
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,283
it wasn't Isobel
who vandalized the signs,

542
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:23,019
I think it was someone
much closer to home.

543
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,588
<i>( knocking )</i>

544
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,545
I was in your
workshop earlier.

545
00:30:49,546 --> 00:30:51,514
I found a can
of spray-paint.

546
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:55,685
The same sort that's
been used on the road signs.

547
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:58,655
You think
I painted over them?

548
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:00,657
I didn't say that.

549
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:03,093
Certainly did think it
though, didn't you?

550
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,194
The thought had
crossed my mind.

551
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,832
You've been telling
anyone who'll listen

552
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,967
how much you disapprove
of the wolf center.

553
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:13,469
You're dead set
against everything

554
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,339
that I try to do
to change the estate.

555
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,241
Why not take it
one step further?

556
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:20,010
You know me
better than that.

557
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,978
I thought I did.

558
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:24,748
Look, Archie, you've evicted
me from my home. You've...

559
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:28,451
taken away a whole part
of the job I live for.

560
00:31:28,452 --> 00:31:30,720
I've every reason
to be angry.

561
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:34,891
<i>But I will stick by you</i>

562
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:36,660
right or wrong.

563
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,630
And you made it pretty
clear that it's wrong.

564
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,433
This place has
to change, Golly,

565
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:46,903
whether you
like it or not.

566
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:51,007
If you go on at this rate you'll be the
only one here to see how it turns out.

567
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:53,509
Hector wouldn't
have done it like this.

568
00:31:57,848 --> 00:32:00,016
I'm not my father.

569
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,999
Did you see how she reacted when
you said you knew her secret?

570
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,802
It was as if she'd been
kicked by a polo pony.

571
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,937
You think she does
have a secret?

572
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:22,939
Don't we all?

573
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,708
I wish I'd
asked Hector.

574
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,510
Molly, I have
a secret of my own.

575
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:30,279
- Gavin.
- I know.

576
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,315
It wasn't hard to guess.

577
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:35,418
I had my reason for taking
on a personal trainer.

578
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:38,621
'Cause Gavin wanted one? I
suppose he needs to keep fit.

579
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:41,657
<i>No- Gavin is
my personal trainer.</i>

580
00:32:41,658 --> 00:32:44,260
I'm a little bit
embarrassed about it.

581
00:32:44,261 --> 00:32:46,262
Gavin is your
personal trainer?

582
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:49,265
- Mmm.
- Oh- so you're not gay?

583
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:51,901
Well, I'm pretty merry
after that St. Emilion-

584
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,604
good grief!

585
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,973
Did you think
I was a nancy boy?

586
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:59,042
- No, no, no.
- That's outrageous!

587
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,644
I am 110% heterosexual!

588
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:04,247
I'm a great admirer
of the fairer sex

589
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:07,050
and of one delightful
member of it in particular.

590
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,852
If fact, Molly,

591
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,154
since we're talking
about secrets,

592
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,990
I have another one
concerning you and me.

593
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:16,659
Of course, it was
just like you and me.

594
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,162
I thought I knew
your secret,

595
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,864
but I got
the wrong secret.

596
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,767
I've done the same with Isobel.
The road signs weren't her secret.

597
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,803
It was something else. The
reason she keeps coming back here.

598
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,072
Yes, but we have
no idea what that is.

599
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:32,275
What were we
talking about? 1959.

600
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:35,711
That was the year I met Hector.
Isobel was in Alaska.

601
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:39,448
The funny thing is, Hector
would never talk about that time.

602
00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:41,450
Well, then we're stymied.

603
00:33:41,451 --> 00:33:44,020
There might be something
in Isobel's book.

604
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:46,289
Yes, but- Molly!

605
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,660
Oh.

606
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:06,742
<i>( door opens )</i>

607
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,718
Arch.

608
00:34:17,087 --> 00:34:18,621
Come on.

609
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,565
Oh, I've got to go and check
the wolves before I go to bed.

610
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:32,535
- Keep the wolf from the door, eh?
- No, they don't have a door.

611
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:35,104
It's like a hole
in the ground.

612
00:34:35,105 --> 00:34:37,273
Do you want a hand?

613
00:34:37,274 --> 00:34:39,275
No, it's kind
of muddy up there.

614
00:34:39,276 --> 00:34:41,311
I don't mind.
Where do they sleep?

615
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:45,148
In a den. Well, the mother
will be under the ground

616
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,151
with her cub just now. But
the really interesting thing is

617
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,987
the father wolf
goes out to eat

618
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,056
and then he comes back
to the burrow

619
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,458
and regurgitates the food
so that they can have some.

620
00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:57,493
That's so romantic.

621
00:34:57,494 --> 00:34:59,329
Is it?

622
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,431
You, me, moonlight, and
the smell of wolf vomit.

623
00:35:02,432 --> 00:35:04,667
What more could
a girl want?

624
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,505
What are you
thinking about?

625
00:35:09,506 --> 00:35:11,574
I forgot
to feed the rabbits.

626
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,346
Good night, Duncan.

627
00:35:34,631 --> 00:35:36,399
Sorry, did I wake you?

628
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,401
Where have you been?

629
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:41,337
Out...
at my Auntie Liz's.

630
00:35:41,338 --> 00:35:44,573
Emergency-
plumbing thing.

631
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:46,542
Right.

632
00:35:46,543 --> 00:35:49,112
How was your evening?

633
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,480
( sighs )
I didn't have one.

634
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,650
Good morning, Isobel.
I hope you slept well.

635
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:31,020
No, I was up all night
sabotaging Archie's zoo.

636
00:36:32,122 --> 00:36:35,157
Archie told me
I have to apologize to you.

637
00:36:35,158 --> 00:36:38,561
I am very sorry.
And as my penance

638
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:40,963
I'm reading your book.

639
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:44,200
Here's Hector's bookmark.
Got all the way to...

640
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:47,036
page five.

641
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:04,320
- It's our first customer!
- You know what to do.

642
00:37:09,926 --> 00:37:11,828
Oh, dear.

643
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:15,398
- What? It's still very early.
- And very empty.

644
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,634
Look, I know my mother
handled it badly,

645
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:22,037
but we have had a few problems
with the signs and the adverts.

646
00:37:22,038 --> 00:37:24,540
They're starting
to arrive.

647
00:37:26,643 --> 00:37:29,679
You haven't had
one single visitor.

648
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,082
There really isn't
much more to say.

649
00:37:37,988 --> 00:37:39,589
What happened?

650
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:44,994
She wanted a garage.

651
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:47,129
<i>( knocking )</i>

652
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,231
Hello?

653
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:52,268
Esme, hi, could you give me a
hand down at the visitors' center?

654
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,604
- The girl that works there hasn't turned up.
- Yeah.

655
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,739
You're not leaving,
are you?

656
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,041
No, I'm just
tidying up.

657
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:01,511
<i>There is something
I wanted to say.</i>

658
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,647
I know since you've been here
everybody's been a wee bit on edge,

659
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:06,982
what with the opening
and everything else.

660
00:38:06,983 --> 00:38:09,652
<i>But, you know, it's not
always like this.</i>

661
00:38:09,653 --> 00:38:11,788
<i>- it's quite good really.
- Yeah?</i>

662
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,823
I mean,
it worked out for me.

663
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:17,026
I came here as the cook, and now
I'm going to be marrying the laird.

664
00:38:17,027 --> 00:38:19,995
- Don't you get any ideas though, eh.
- As if.

665
00:38:19,996 --> 00:38:22,064
<i>Are you really
marrying Archie?</i>

666
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:23,299
Yeah, yeah.

667
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,335
What, did you not know?

668
00:38:26,336 --> 00:38:28,370
No... it's just
the way he treats you.

669
00:38:28,371 --> 00:38:30,372
Maybe you're
used to it.

670
00:38:30,373 --> 00:38:32,575
- Me and Archie get on just fine.
- Okay.

671
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:36,011
- What made you think that?
- Maybe it's just since I've been here.

672
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:38,481
Things have been different
since you've been here.

673
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:42,485
Look, I'll go to the visitors'
center. There's something I need to do.

674
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:53,529
How's it going?

675
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,498
We could squeeze in
one or two more.

676
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,132
Where's Isobel?

677
00:38:57,133 --> 00:39:00,202
She's writing her report
for Wildlife Scotland.

678
00:39:00,203 --> 00:39:02,338
Ah, so we've lost
the grant. great.

679
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:10,546
Well, at least
we have one customer.

680
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:12,314
Morning!

681
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,618
( muffled )
�5 each, please.

682
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,489
We also have
illustrated guides.

683
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:22,291
And maps of
the wildlife trails.

684
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:23,960
I beg your pardon?

685
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:26,462
- Sorry, are you a concession?
- A what?

686
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:30,232
Under 16?
An old age pe-

687
00:39:30,233 --> 00:39:32,568
<i>- unemployed.
- Molly: Duncan-</i>

688
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:34,837
don't be so silly.
Kilwillie's my guest.

689
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:37,874
Kilwillie, I wonder if you could
help me with something in the house.

690
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,409
At your service.

691
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,578
<i>( car engine starts )</i>

692
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,021
Can I have a go
in the bouncy castle?

693
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:55,424
No, you stay here. I'll try
and drum up some business.

694
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:20,015
- Gavin and I have had a parting of the ways.
- Oh, no. why?

695
00:40:20,016 --> 00:40:22,351
On mature reflection,
I came to see that a chap

696
00:40:22,352 --> 00:40:24,753
can get all the exercise
he needs on the golf course.

697
00:40:24,754 --> 00:40:27,289
Gavin was rather
surplus to requirements.

698
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:31,193
Mind you, if you ever need a
jogging partner, look no further.

699
00:40:31,194 --> 00:40:33,995
You'll be at the top
of my list.

700
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:37,299
- What exactly are we doing?
- Digging up Hector's past.

701
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,000
I want to know exactly
what he and Isobel

702
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:41,370
were up to in 1959.

703
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:45,173
- That's rather a tall order, isn't it?
- Hector always kept a diary.

704
00:40:45,174 --> 00:40:47,409
I think there must
be some clue

705
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:50,812
to Isobel's secret
somewhere here.

706
00:40:53,216 --> 00:40:55,050
<i>Ahh.</i>

707
00:40:56,286 --> 00:40:58,554
Ahh.

708
00:40:58,555 --> 00:41:01,590
I don't know who told you that.
We most definitely are open today.

709
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:03,525
Well,
maybe another time.

710
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:04,793
<i>Okay.</i>

711
00:41:06,863 --> 00:41:08,964
Somebody has phoned
all the schools

712
00:41:08,965 --> 00:41:10,932
<i>and told them
we're closed.</i>

713
00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:13,902
It's Esme.
I found these in her bag.

714
00:41:25,815 --> 00:41:27,683
( gasps )

715
00:41:38,027 --> 00:41:39,595
<i>( grunts )</i>

716
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:49,438
Oh!

717
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,876
<i>( air hissing )</i>

718
00:41:58,448 --> 00:42:00,215
<i>( clicking switch )</i>

719
00:42:00,216 --> 00:42:03,285
- It must be the generator.
- The electric fence.

720
00:42:03,286 --> 00:42:04,753
Both:
The wolves!

721
00:42:04,754 --> 00:42:07,022
<i>( Esme grunting )</i>

722
00:42:07,023 --> 00:42:09,925
- Get away!
- No, I'm letting them out.

723
00:42:09,926 --> 00:42:13,128
- I'll just have to shoot them.
- That'll look great in the papers.

724
00:42:13,129 --> 00:42:15,698
<i>- This place will never open.
- give me those!</i>

725
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,099
Why are you doing this after
what Archie's done to you?

726
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,901
What are you
talking about?

727
00:42:19,902 --> 00:42:23,305
- Being chucked out of your house.
- That's none of your business.

728
00:42:23,306 --> 00:42:25,341
Why don't you
just leave, get a life?

729
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,643
I've got a life. You just
stand there and shut up!

730
00:42:27,644 --> 00:42:30,212
Esme!

731
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,049
<i>- Did any escape?
- only her.</i>

732
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,819
<i>- Can you get that patched up?
- yeah, no problem.</i>

733
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,153
<i>Esme!</i>

734
00:42:40,089 --> 00:42:42,825
Isobel, Kilwillie and I
have a question for you.

735
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,927
This isn't a good moment. This
powercutter's crashed my computer

736
00:42:45,928 --> 00:42:48,397
and I've lost my whole
report for Wildlife Scotland.

737
00:42:48,398 --> 00:42:50,599
It won't take a moment.
It's about your book.

738
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,169
- Which one?
- "Isobel Hogg: A Remarkable Life. "

739
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:58,640
<i>We think it should be
"Isobel Hogg: A Remarkable Lie. "</i>

740
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,243
<i>Archie: Esme!</i>

741
00:43:14,657 --> 00:43:16,658
Isn't that your car?

742
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,131
Don't worry about
losing your car,

743
00:43:23,132 --> 00:43:25,233
you're about to lose
your reputation.

744
00:43:25,234 --> 00:43:28,003
<i>Alaska, 1959,</i>

745
00:43:28,004 --> 00:43:30,706
the adventure that got you
in all the papers

746
00:43:30,707 --> 00:43:32,441
<i>and made you
so very famous-</i>

747
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:35,944
you were all alone in the
frozen north for a whole year?

748
00:43:35,945 --> 00:43:38,547
Except you weren't.
You were here!

749
00:43:38,548 --> 00:43:41,450
Canoodling with Hector!
It's all here-

750
00:43:41,451 --> 00:43:44,720
- in his diary.
- That doesn't prove a thing.

751
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:48,123
You also signed
the visitors' book.

752
00:43:51,494 --> 00:43:53,529
Hector swore
he'd never tell.

753
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,163
He didn't,

754
00:43:55,164 --> 00:43:57,165
but I might.

755
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,498
( screams )

756
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:43,645
- Come on.
- Get off me.

757
00:44:43,646 --> 00:44:46,314
- Get off me!
- I'm on the same side as you are.

758
00:44:46,315 --> 00:44:48,817
The whole wolf center
is about conservation.

759
00:44:48,818 --> 00:44:50,819
- It's a zoo!
- It's a zoo with a point!

760
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,522
- Do you know anything about wolves?
- A lot more than you.

761
00:44:53,523 --> 00:44:56,525
Then you'll know the red wolf was
completely extinct in the wild.

762
00:44:56,526 --> 00:44:59,561
It needed protection in captivity
before it could get put back.

763
00:44:59,562 --> 00:45:01,930
- That's what we're trying to do.
- I know about zoos.

764
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:04,065
They go on about how
they're into conservation,

765
00:45:04,066 --> 00:45:06,468
but what they really do
is inflate their owner's egos.

766
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:09,304
- We're going to the police.
- Get off!

767
00:45:09,305 --> 00:45:11,006
Come on.

768
00:45:14,243 --> 00:45:17,078
Oh, look, you know what?
That's our first visitors.

769
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:22,718
- Ticket machine's not working.
- Kids get in free and they get an ice cream.

770
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:26,021
- You're kidding.
- The freezer's not working.

771
00:45:26,022 --> 00:45:28,423
What else will we do
with 500 warm Magnums?

772
00:45:28,424 --> 00:45:30,358
<i>Boy:
I want some ice cream.</i>

773
00:45:33,362 --> 00:45:36,632
I don't like seeing them
caged up any more than you do.

774
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:39,868
One day maybe they'll be
free to walk the hills.

775
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:43,005
What we've got going here
is not perfect,

776
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:45,541
but it's a step in the right
direction, isn't it?

777
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,709
Maybe.

778
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:50,045
Why did you
pick on Glenbogle?

779
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:53,181
I read something Professor Hogg
wrote in the paper about it.

780
00:45:54,283 --> 00:45:56,752
She said how you were
opening this zoo.

781
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,887
Did you really
run away from home

782
00:45:58,888 --> 00:46:01,089
<i>- or were you lying about that, too?
- No.</i>

783
00:46:02,592 --> 00:46:04,927
I had a row
with my dad.

784
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,495
I can never do
anything right.

785
00:46:07,496 --> 00:46:09,631
Nothing's ever good enough,
you know?

786
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:14,670
I didn't steal that money.
I promise.

787
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,238
I don't care
about the money.

788
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:19,041
You hurt Lexie.
You let her down.

789
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,843
I'm sorry.

790
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:24,012
( kids chattering )

791
00:46:38,294 --> 00:46:39,962
I hope you're
pleased with yourself.

792
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:43,031
- Did you call the police?
- Yeah, they're on their way.

793
00:46:43,032 --> 00:46:45,634
Tell them
not to bother.

794
00:46:45,635 --> 00:46:48,870
Go and get your bags. Duncan
will drive you to the station.

795
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:50,472
I don't understand.

796
00:46:50,473 --> 00:46:52,173
Quick,
before I change my mind.

797
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:57,746
- What's going on?
- She's a kid. She made a mistake.

798
00:46:57,747 --> 00:47:00,983
What about the money she
took? That's just thieving.

799
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,118
I'd like to give her
another chance.

800
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,621
That's what Glenbogle
did for you, isn't it?

801
00:47:07,156 --> 00:47:11,126
- Yeah. - And maybe
she's a bit like me-

802
00:47:11,127 --> 00:47:13,829
a bad case
of tunnel vision.

803
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:17,432
Don't blame yourself. You
were right about her all along.

804
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:18,800
Come here.

805
00:47:24,206 --> 00:47:26,174
Archie MacDonald,

806
00:47:26,175 --> 00:47:28,243
I'm glad that
I'm marrying you.

807
00:47:28,244 --> 00:47:31,546
- Are you sure?
- Mmm... most days.

808
00:47:31,547 --> 00:47:33,581
- ( chuckles )
- And you?

809
00:47:33,582 --> 00:47:35,083
Oh, yes.

810
00:47:36,252 --> 00:47:38,319
But you might want
to concentrate

811
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,989
on the for-richer-for-poorer
bit at the wedding vows.

812
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:54,736
<i>Archie: Isobel?</i>

813
00:47:54,737 --> 00:47:58,774
Owing to the power cut I haven't
been able to complete my report.

814
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,576
But... I shall
be recommending

815
00:48:01,577 --> 00:48:03,945
that you receive
your grant in full.

816
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:08,050
Well, I don't understand.

817
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,352
And I'm not about to explain.
I shall be leaving directly.

818
00:48:11,353 --> 00:48:14,056
There's been a slight
problem with your car.

819
00:48:15,457 --> 00:48:17,592
Then perhaps you'd
call me a taxi.

820
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:21,462
A word of advice...

821
00:48:21,463 --> 00:48:23,464
<i>don't take
anything for granted</i>

822
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:25,767
until you get him
down the aisle.

823
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:31,573
- Who would like an ice cream?
- Kids: Me!

824
00:48:31,574 --> 00:48:33,542
Come on then.

825
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,949
Was that a smile?

826
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,884
Getting on for one.

827
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:47,989
( sighs ) Look, Golly,
I owe you an apology.

828
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,161
What I said to you
yesterday was unfair.

829
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:53,929
I should
have known better.

830
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,532
And while we're at it, I should
have listened to Lexie, too.

831
00:48:57,667 --> 00:49:00,602
But I've...
I've learned my lesson.

832
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:03,605
Oh- I've got
something for you.

833
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,448
I'm not going
to rent out your croft.

834
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,916
Once it's refurbished
it's yours.

835
00:49:14,917 --> 00:49:17,152
You'll own it.

836
00:49:17,153 --> 00:49:19,020
You need the money.

837
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:21,123
Yeah, but we'll
find it somewhere else.

838
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,991
We've got this grant
for a start.

839
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,698
Thank you.

840
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:32,434
You said something yesterday
about me trying to...

841
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:34,836
buy your approval.

842
00:49:34,837 --> 00:49:37,672
Well, I'm not trying
to do that.

843
00:49:37,673 --> 00:49:40,442
I need you to tell me
when I'm getting things wrong.

844
00:49:40,443 --> 00:49:42,211
That's if
you'll listen.

845
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,146
I'll try.

846
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:48,317
I guess, in a way,
we're paying the price

847
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,619
of my father keeping
things the same for so long.

848
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,654
Maybe.

849
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:55,924
Then again, there's new
tricks in old dogs, son.

850
00:49:55,925 --> 00:49:57,892
You're not old.

851
00:49:57,893 --> 00:49:59,828
Well, not that old.

852
00:50:01,564 --> 00:50:05,567
Day one, 55 visitors,
no revenue.

853
00:50:05,568 --> 00:50:08,003
Yeah, but they all
had a nice time

854
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:10,038
<i>and they'll tell
their mates.</i>

855
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:12,141
And they'll all
expect free ice cream.

856
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,311
Look, last night,
you said something like,

857
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:18,813
"well, if I'm no use
at being a laird,

858
00:50:18,814 --> 00:50:21,316
then I'll be no use
at being a husband. "

859
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:23,619
Well, I've been
thinking about that.

860
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,087
And I think
that being a laird

861
00:50:26,088 --> 00:50:28,390
<i>is a bit like
being a husband.</i>

862
00:50:28,391 --> 00:50:30,526
You can't do it
on your own.

863
00:50:32,094 --> 00:50:33,828
But I'm with you.

864
00:50:35,097 --> 00:50:38,534
Oh, not interrupting
anything, am I?

865
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,403
No, no, just a bit
of creative accounting.

866
00:50:41,404 --> 00:50:44,273
Molly, they're lovely.
Who are they from?

867
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:46,808
Me, for you.
For your anniversary.

868
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:50,279
Well, we're not getting
married for another month.

869
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,715
Ah, the anniversary of the day
you arrived on our doorstep.

870
00:50:53,716 --> 00:50:56,117
Mmm, all those
years ago.

871
00:50:56,118 --> 00:50:58,287
Watch it, I can still
change my mind.

872
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:00,422
To think we nearly made
the same mistake twice.

873
00:51:00,423 --> 00:51:02,757
- First Lexie, then Esme.
- Some people never learn.

874
00:51:02,758 --> 00:51:05,460
Oh, by the way,
I took �50 from the safe.

875
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:08,029
<i>- forgot to say.
- Did you close the door?</i>

876
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,598
Sorry.

877
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,804
