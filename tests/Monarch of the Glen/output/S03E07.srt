00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:33,848
Lexie:
Whoo! who's that?

5
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:35,016
Nobody.

6
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:37,252
<i>Duncan,
she's all body.</i>

7
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:40,588
Is that your wee friend? The
one that sends you letters?

8
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:42,957
- No!
- "To Duncan,

9
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:46,461
from your pen friend,
Marie-Helene. "

10
00:00:46,462 --> 00:00:49,164
Five kisses.
French kisses.

11
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:52,033
Look, it's not like that.
We're just good fr-

12
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:53,934
she's got a boyfriend.

13
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:56,103
- That can change.
- I've never even met her.

14
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:58,806
Mmm, that can
change too. here.

15
00:00:58,807 --> 00:01:01,442
- Telemessage for you.
- You opened it?

16
00:01:01,443 --> 00:01:03,144
Thought I'd save you
the bother.

17
00:01:04,513 --> 00:01:06,714
What? that's
good news, isn't it?

18
00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:09,050
- She's coming here!
- She can't.

19
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:11,219
- What's up?
- I cannot tell you.

20
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,021
Well,
we'll soon find out.

21
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:16,291
She'll be on the train
by now. ( giggles )

( phone clatters )

30
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:15,983
Let me guess...

31
00:02:15,984 --> 00:02:19,120
your friend, Marie-Helene.
Lexie told me all about her.

32
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:21,689
She's not there.
Just voicemail.

33
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,025
- You're going to see her in a couple of hours.
- No! I won't be here.

34
00:02:25,026 --> 00:02:27,995
- I'm going to my mother's.
- No, Duncan!

35
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:31,098
When I was at school,

36
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:33,067
I had a pen friend
called Simone,

37
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:35,570
<i>and I used to make up
all sorts of things,</i>

38
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:38,239
<i>just to entertain her.
And then one day,</i>

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,175
I was absolutely terrified
she might turn up and visit,

40
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:44,579
and discover the real me wasn't
at all like I was in the letters.

41
00:02:46,014 --> 00:02:48,716
But I'm sure you would
never do anything like that.

42
00:02:48,717 --> 00:02:51,753
I would. I did.
I told her a pack of lies.

43
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,888
Now she's coming here
with her fancy boyfriend,

44
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:56,791
and I'm not sticking around to
look like a complete numptie.

45
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:59,160
Oh dear. how long have
you been writing to her?

46
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:01,396
Since I was 13,
Ms. Skinner's class.

47
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:03,331
So you'd really like
to see her again,

48
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:05,566
Marie-Helene, I mean.
Not Ms. Skinner.

49
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:07,602
I've always dreamed
of seeing her.

50
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:09,970
<i>It was a silly kid's thing,
but when I was at school,</i>

51
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:13,174
I was... kind of...
in love with her.

52
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,245
Right, Duncan.
Let's make it happen.

53
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:19,314
What?!

54
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:25,252
How come you've stopped
eating with the grown-ups?

55
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,725
( sighs ) You enjoy the
scintillating conversation with me.

56
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:34,629
What's happened?

57
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,631
( sniffs )
Nothing.

58
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:39,099
Is it bad news?

59
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,402
It's my divorce.

60
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:44,872
I never thought it
would be so fast.

61
00:03:44,873 --> 00:03:48,443
It's not bad news at
all. It's great news.

62
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:50,144
I'm just being stupid.

63
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,682
- Look, if you want to cry-
- ( Stella laughs )

64
00:03:54,683 --> 00:03:56,917
Just cry.

65
00:03:56,918 --> 00:04:00,621
- It's your divorce.
- I don't want to.

66
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,124
Why do I let him
do this to me?

67
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,126
You're asking me?

68
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:08,796
( laughs )
Fat lot I know.

69
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:11,165
Remember Stuart?

70
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,668
If there's one thing
I do know,

71
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:16,003
it's that they're
not worth it.

72
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:17,839
None of them.

73
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,408
Oh, this is pathetic.

74
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:22,810
I should be cracking open
the champagne.

75
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:25,446
What me to go get you
some from the shop?

76
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:26,947
No, I'll get it.

77
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,352
Are you doing
anything tonight?

78
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:33,254
Me?
( scoffs )

79
00:04:33,255 --> 00:04:35,289
- No.
- You are now.

80
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,259
- I'm not drinking on my own.
- Okay.

81
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:44,499
<i>( dog barking )</i>

82
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:56,377

83
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:59,647
- Can I help?
- Those dogs should be kept under proper control.

84
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:03,751
Monty, Rommel,
come on.

85
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:06,888
I'm sorry, this garden isn't open
to the public. There is a sign.

86
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,758
I believe you'll find I'm within my
legal rights. I'm not causing any damage.

87
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,895
By the by, the internationally
accepted form for that sign

88
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,664
is a red-rimmed circle
containing a walking figure

89
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:18,933
struck through
with a red, oblique line.

90
00:05:18,934 --> 00:05:21,502
- Would you excuse me?
- ( dog growls )

91
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:26,407
( Molly claps )
Now I've got you all here,

92
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:28,443
I've got some good news
from the hospital.

93
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:30,778
They say that Hector
is really improving.

94
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:32,847
That's not more
duffed news about him?

95
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:35,416
It may be some time before
he can sit down again,

96
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,051
but remember,
we don't talk about it.

97
00:05:37,052 --> 00:05:39,754
Well, people are asking.
I need to tell them something.

98
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:42,824
I just say Glenbogle's
not the only ancient pile

99
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:45,793
that's been troubling him.
That seems to work.

100
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:48,696
- Sorry.
- Ah, here you are. We need you.

101
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:51,298
<i>- Sounds ominous.
- not at all.</i>

102
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,201
Duncan has a problem.

103
00:05:54,202 --> 00:05:56,637
Just the one?

104
00:05:56,638 --> 00:06:00,608
His friend Marie-Helene has clearly
misunderstood one of Duncan's letters.

105
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:02,677
French can be such
a tricky language.

106
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:05,780
You ask for a hairbrush,
they bring you a horse brush.

107
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:08,683
It's all too, too muddling.
Anyway, as I was saying,

108
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:11,018
dear Marie-Helene
seems confused

109
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:14,288
about what it is
Duncan actually does.

110
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:16,924
That's no surprise.
Half the time Duncan's confused

111
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:18,493
about what he actually does.

112
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:21,395
Duncan's worried that his French
friends will be disappointed.

113
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:23,798
So I thought it would
be easier all around

114
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,766
if just for a couple
of days,

115
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:28,402
Duncan became the laird
of Glenbogle.

116
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:34,241
<i>You told her
you were the laird?</i>

117
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:36,110
Kind of.

118
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:38,813
And as far as she's concerned,
he will be. everyone happy?

119
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:41,348
Just hold on
a wee minute.

120
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:43,350
Duncan has a job to do,
I rely on him.

121
00:06:43,351 --> 00:06:44,752
Archie can do that.

122
00:06:44,753 --> 00:06:47,021
You want me
to do Duncan's job,

123
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:49,590
- and Duncan to do mine?
- Very good, dear.

124
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:51,091
It would've taken me hours

125
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:53,427
to explain something like that
to your father.

126
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:34,769
Don't feel like
emptying that one, no?

127
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:38,573
<i>- Didn't see it.
- "job's worth doing... "</i>

128
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:40,908
I know, I know.
Give me a chance.

129
00:07:44,913 --> 00:07:47,214
<i>- Soon get the hang of it.
- Man: excuse me?</i>

130
00:07:47,215 --> 00:07:48,749
I have a complaint.

131
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,918
It concerns your equipment.

132
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:54,555
That lifebelt holder
would appear to be empty.

133
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:56,323
There's another one
just there.

134
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:57,725
What's more,
there's nobody out on the loch,

135
00:07:57,726 --> 00:07:59,660
and we're not
expecting the Titanic.

136
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:02,396
You may not take the danger
of drowning seriously,

137
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:04,632
but I most certainly do.

138
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:08,435
A member of my family drowned in
that loch. I take it very seriously.

139
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:11,472
That doesn't run to supplying
adequate safety equipment?


140
00:08:11,473 --> 00:08:13,273
Most slipshod.

141
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:15,409
You're doing this because I
threw you out of the garden.

142
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,979
No, I'm merely drawing
your attention to the fact-

143
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,381
perhaps you'd like
your entrance fee back then?

144
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:22,883
No, no.
Hey, easy.

145
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:27,121
You're talking
to the wrong person.

146
00:08:27,122 --> 00:08:29,624
If you've got a problem,
take it to the estate office.

147
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:37,999
We arrive at the table like this,

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,934
and then-

149
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,603
- Duncan-
- oh, sorry.

150
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:52,113
Thank you.

151
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:06,593
Ahem-
would you like to taste?

152
00:09:08,396 --> 00:09:09,730
Yes, please.

153
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:13,000
( fizzes )

154
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,143
( sloshing )

155
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:27,347
I don't know.

156
00:09:27,348 --> 00:09:29,416
Hmm, not good enough
for you?

157
00:09:30,618 --> 00:09:32,853
Perhaps the '92
would be better?

158
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:34,655
Mmm.
( giggles )

159
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:37,958
Not bad, wee man. He's more
like Archie than Archie.

160
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:42,663
I understand you
accommodate paying guests?

161
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:45,666
I'll require an inexpensive
room for the night.

162
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:49,136
That's no problem. We have
one with a view of the loch.

163
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:52,272
<i>- I'm not here for the scenery.
- ( door opens )</i>

164
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:55,976
- I've got to go to the station.
- This is Mr. Barr.

165
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:59,413
- Yeah, we've met.
- He's the assistant chief inspector

166
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:02,216
with the regional health
and safety executive.

167
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:06,954
I see.

168
00:10:06,955 --> 00:10:09,623
He's here to carry out
a spot-check inspection

169
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:12,359
<i>and he wants you
to help him.</i>

170
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,795
- Me?
- You are the head ranger, are you not?

171
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:17,231
Umm... yeah, yeah.

172
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:19,033
Good. in that case,

173
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:21,168
we start tomorrow
at 9:00 prompt.

174
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,408
Go get the barrow.

175
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:30,911
She might have more bags
than you can carry.

176
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:34,115
Listen, you don't give the orders
around here. Duncan's the laird.

177
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:36,951
And you are Duncan. So that
means we can boss you around.

178
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:43,690
- She's not here. Let's go.
- No, no!

179
00:10:43,691 --> 00:10:46,493
- Is that her there?
- No!

180
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:47,862
( giggles )

181
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:51,365
Ah, Duncan.
Is that Marie-Helene?

182
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:00,808
Ooh-la-la.

183
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:02,977
Duncan,
she's lovely.

184
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,989
- Maybe this isn't a good idea.
- Of course it is.

185
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,424
<i>- courage, mon ami.
- What?</i>

186
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:21,395
<i>- bonjour.
- Duncan, hello.</i>

187
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:29,670
( clears throat,
laughs nervously )

188
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:32,206
<i>Bienvenue en ecosse,</i>

189
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:35,876
<i>c'est un tres
grand plaisir por moi,</i>

190
00:11:35,877 --> 00:11:37,845
<i>et ma famille,</i>

191
00:11:37,846 --> 00:11:39,980
<i>de faire votre
connaissance</i>

192
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:42,582
<i>merci beaucoup.
Tu es tres gentile.</i>

193
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,285
<i>Et Glenbogle,
c'est loin?</i>

194
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,956
<i>Non, non. c'est pas loin.
On habite au bord du lac.</i>

195
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:51,158
<i>C'est a peu pres
a 40 minutes d'ici.</i>

196
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,828
By the way, I'm Molly.

197
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:57,331
Duncan's mother.
And this is Lexie.

198
00:11:57,332 --> 00:12:00,201
<i>- and that's Archie.
- He'll take your bags for you.</i>

199
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:03,537
<i>Molly: Are you alone? I thought
you were coming with a friend.</i>

200
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:05,940
I'm sorry. I didn't say in the telegram.

201
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:08,909
Alain had to stay
in Edinburgh.

202
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,846
What a shame. anyway,
it's lovely to see you.

203
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:13,547
Archie!

204
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:19,553
Land Rover.

205
00:12:19,554 --> 00:12:21,555
Where is
the Ferrari?

206
00:12:21,556 --> 00:12:23,657
The Ferrari's...

207
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:26,026
got a burst...
thingy.

208
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:27,627
<i>Lexie:
Yeah! I mean-</i>

209
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:29,330
does that all the time.

210
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,098
You know,
bursts its thingy.

211
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,168
( forced laughter )

212
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:36,570
( bagpipes playing loudly )

213
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:48,015
( shouting ) Duncan,
this is unbelievable.

214
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:49,649
No, it's all true.

215
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,852
When you talked
about the house,

216
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:54,355
I didn't realize
it was so big,

217
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,456
and so old,
and so beautiful.

218
00:12:56,457 --> 00:12:58,058
Just like you.
I mean-

219
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:00,694
- ( bagpipes stop )
- ( loudly ) not big and old-

220
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:02,229
ahem.

221
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:08,802
Now, where have
we met before?

222
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:10,137
We haven't.

223
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:12,806
I'm sure I know your face
from somewhere.

224
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:18,979
Tell me about
health and safety.

225
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,316
- It must be terribly exciting.
- No, it isn't.

226
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:24,218
But you seem to have
so much to do.

227
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:26,820
<i>What were you measuring
just now?</i>

228
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:28,855
The noise level's
over the limit.

229
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:30,991
<i>Your piper should
be wearing ear defenders.</i>

230
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:33,227
But it'll have to wait,

231
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:35,362
I'm on a scheduled
meal break now.

232
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:38,832
Oh, good. then we can talk
about the off-duty Mr. Barr.

233
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:42,002
I want to know all about you.
Do you have children?

234
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:44,538
I suppose if you did
they'd be called mini-barrs.

235
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:46,807
I don't.
And they wouldn't.

236
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:50,644
But there's a Mrs. Barr?

237
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:53,380
Yes.

238
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:55,382
What a shame she couldn't
have come with you.

239
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:58,885
My wife recently left me to live
with a chiropodist in Devon.

240
00:13:58,886 --> 00:14:01,288
And she doesn't
return my calls.

241
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,924
Oh, I'm-
I'm so, so sorry.

242
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:10,497
Roast venison.

243
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:15,436
Lexie, you're meant to
serve the guests first.

244
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,737
And you're meant
to carve-

245
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:19,273
my laird.

246
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:34,221
<i>( knocking )</i>

247
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:37,291
<i>- oh, hi.
- Not quite what you're used to, huh?</i>

248
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,526
Right. did you manage
to find those books?

249
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:42,096
I reckon Duncan's got
most of what you need.

250
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:45,565
Right, what have we
got here?

251
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:47,667
"Working
with wild birds,"

252
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:50,670
"first aid, basic,"
"first aid, advanced,"

253
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:53,073
and a safety manual.

254
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:55,809
- Where's the important stuff?
- It's all important, Archie.

255
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,778
That's why I've been sending
Duncan on courses for the last year.

256
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:00,814
<i>Don't you think
it might be a good idea</i>

257
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:03,083
<i>to tell this inspector chappie
the truth?</i>

258
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:05,119
I don't want to spoil
Duncan's big day.

259
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,721
<i>You know health and safety
can shut us down on the spot?</i>

260
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:09,056
If he finds something wrong,

261
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:10,991
which he won't do
once I've read this lot.

262
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:13,360
I'm determined not to leave
anything up to chance.

263
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:14,395
<i>- ( sizzling )
- Like your toast?</i>

264
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:20,300
Like I said- why don't you
just tell this guy the truth?

265
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:28,775
I brought you something. It's
from the shop where I work.

266
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:31,178
- Wow.
- It's nothing special.

267
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,218
Oh! I've always wanted
one that does stunts.

268
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:41,088
It's brilliant!

269
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:43,123
<i>May I look
at your photos?</i>

270
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:45,125
Are they all
of your family?

271
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:47,694
Umm...

272
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:50,264
<i>family and friends.</i>

273
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,866
<i>There are none
of Duncan.</i>

274
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:54,768
No, he doesn't like
having his photograph taken.

275
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:56,370
( laughs )

276
00:15:56,371 --> 00:15:59,873
- Lots of Archie.
- Yeah, of course.

277
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:02,376
Why?

278
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:06,413
Uh...

279
00:16:06,414 --> 00:16:07,981
I'm very fond of Archie.

280
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:09,849
The chauffeur?

281
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,785
He's a sort of
project of mine.

282
00:16:11,786 --> 00:16:15,489
Poor Archie, comes
from a very good family.

283
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,757
But he went to the bad-

284
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:19,859
drink, drugs, joyriding.

285
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,896
And the only way
to keep him out of prison-

286
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:24,898
or the lunatic asylum,

287
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,101
was to give him a job
on the estate.

288
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:29,470
You mean... he's mad?

289
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:31,972
If that's the head ranger
you're referring to,

290
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:34,975
he did strike me as being
somewhat on the unreliable side.

291
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:37,344
Oh, he does his best,
considering.

292
00:16:37,345 --> 00:16:39,113
Poor lamb.

293
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:42,516
Ah, I see you're
admiring our roses.

294
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:45,685
Nothing wrong,
is there?

295
00:16:45,686 --> 00:16:47,588
Dangerous thorns?
Excessive pollen?

296
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,623
No, no. it was
for my own interest.

297
00:16:49,624 --> 00:16:51,625
- Are you a gardener?
- No.

298
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:55,329
These roses are
unique to Glenbogle.

299
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,998
There's quite a history
attached to them, actually,

300
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:59,566
very romantic.

301
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,768
I'm aware of that.

302
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:05,739
If you'll excuse me,
I'll bid you good night.

303
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:16,350
- Ta-da!
- ( both giggling )

304
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:18,552
Look what I made you-
it's a divorce cake.

305
00:17:18,553 --> 00:17:21,388
- I burned the groom.
- That's great.

306
00:17:21,389 --> 00:17:23,957
Will you put that down?

307
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,193
This is supposed
to be a celebration.

308
00:17:26,194 --> 00:17:29,896
<i>- But I've got this inspection tomorrow.
- that is tomorrow.</i>

309
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:31,498
<i>Whereas right now,</i>

310
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:34,535
we have cham-poo,
we have cake,

311
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:36,870
and...

312
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:38,772
( sighs )
We have Russell Crowe.

313
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:41,007
<i>So can we please</i>

314
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:42,976
just start enjoying
ourselves?

315
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:45,245
Cheers.

316
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:51,585
Your sort of man,
is he? Russell?

317
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:53,520
Right now, any sort
of man would do.

318
00:17:55,022 --> 00:17:57,191
- Duncan?
- No.

319
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:59,193
He's like a wee brother.

320
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:00,960
You must have thought about Archie.

321
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,098
- What about you and Archie?
- Not a chance.

322
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:07,434
Come on.
You're a free woman now.

323
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:09,736
So why would I want a man?
It's taken me years

324
00:18:09,737 --> 00:18:11,471
<i>to get rid
of the last one.</i>

325
00:18:11,472 --> 00:18:13,073
Anyway,
I asked you first.

326
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:15,809
Hmmm.
Given half a chance-

327
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,077
but he never does.

328
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:19,279
<i>You've got to make
your own chances.</i>

329
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,683
If you want Archie, he's not
going to make the running.

330
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,518
<i>He doesn't know how.</i>

331
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,425
- Your friend, Alain-
- yes.

332
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:33,627
It's a pity he
couldn't be here.

333
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:36,496
- Is he working in Edinburgh?
- Not really.

334
00:18:36,497 --> 00:18:39,733
Oh, what happened?
Nothing to do with me, is it?

335
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:41,468
No, it's me.

336
00:18:41,469 --> 00:18:44,204
I've been with Alain
for five years,

337
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:46,973
and now he brings me
to Edinburgh.

338
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:48,609
And we stay
in a lovely hotel,

339
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,144
<i>and on Saturday
it was my birthday,</i>

340
00:18:51,145 --> 00:18:53,313
<i>so we go
to a beautiful restaurant-</i>

341
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:55,282
candles on the table,

342
00:18:55,283 --> 00:18:57,284
and a view of the castle,

343
00:18:57,285 --> 00:18:59,486
and what do you think?

344
00:19:00,588 --> 00:19:02,556
He asked you
to marry him.

345
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:04,258
No.

346
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:06,226
He talked
about football.

347
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:09,229
- What team does he support?
- ( sighs )

348
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,766
He talked about football because he
didn't want to ask me to marry him.

349
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,768
Duncan, because
of your letters

350
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:17,137
I always dreamed
of coming to Scotland.

351
00:19:17,138 --> 00:19:19,539
It's so beautiful,
so romantic.

352
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:23,377
Alain had arranged this
trip as a surprise for me,

353
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:26,480
and I knew where
it was leading to,

354
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:29,416
perhaps he was nervous.
It's a big thing, isn't it?

355
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:31,718
But I saw the ring.
It was in his suitcase.

356
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:33,620
There you go,
he was going to ask you.

357
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:35,622
That's the point.
I asked him why

358
00:19:35,623 --> 00:19:37,957
he didn't give me
the ring, and he said-

359
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,661
he said that he changed
his mind.

360
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:42,061
<i>He must be mad!</i>

361
00:19:42,062 --> 00:19:44,698
I mean- why would he
do a thing like that?

362
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:48,368
I don't know. he just said
all I could talk about now

363
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:50,771
was dresses and invitations
and churches,

364
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,340
<i>and I didn't know
how to have fun anymore,</i>

365
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:54,808
and I had changed,

366
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:58,178
and I didn't know what to say.
I just started crying.

367
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:00,480
I couldn't stay
with Alain after that,

368
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:02,816
<i>and I didn't want
to go home alone.</i>

369
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:06,353
I knew if I came here
you'd understand.

370
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:08,988
Well, you did
the right thing.

371
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:11,057
Stay as long as you like.

372
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,496
Although I do think
you ought to phone Alain.

373
00:20:16,497 --> 00:20:19,499
<i>He's bound to be
worried about you.</i>

374
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,067
I know I would be.

375
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:23,770
But, Duncan,
you're different.

376
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:27,774
<i>I wish Alain was
a bit more like you.</i>

377
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,712
Good night, Duncan.

378
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:46,526
Aw, all on your own?

379
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:49,095
Here. Don't go getting used to this.

380
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:51,465
It won't last.

381
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:56,370
Lexie, can I
ask you something?

382
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:57,904
Ach, no chance.

383
00:20:57,905 --> 00:21:01,074
Breakfast is the only thing
you'll be getting in bed.

384
00:21:01,075 --> 00:21:02,843
No.

385
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,878
It's about Marie-Helene.

386
00:21:06,146 --> 00:21:07,848
Mmm?

387
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,050
She's split up
with her boyfriend,

388
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:12,252
and, well...

389
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:14,153
it wouldn't be right
for me to-

390
00:21:14,154 --> 00:21:15,489
you know-

391
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,223
take advantage?

392
00:21:17,224 --> 00:21:20,093
<i>Hmm, so you do
fancy her.</i>

393
00:21:20,094 --> 00:21:22,028
It's more than that.

394
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:23,963
I've never met
anyone like her.

395
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:26,032
What?
French, you mean?

396
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:28,067
No, I mean beautiful,

397
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:30,069
and kind, and funny.

398
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,440
- Thanks.
- What I mean is,

399
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:35,842
she could be
the one for me,

400
00:21:35,843 --> 00:21:38,578
the one I've always
dreamed of finding.

401
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,348
Then go for it,
wee man.

402
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:46,019
- It wouldn't be fair.
- Well,

403
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,088
<i>life isn't fair. Else I
wouldn't be fetching you</i>

404
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:50,957
breakfast in bed.

405
00:21:54,595 --> 00:21:57,263
- All ready?
- Yeah, I think so.

406
00:21:57,264 --> 00:22:00,266
One thing, can you try
to be polite to barr?

407
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:02,302
You're the head ranger,
not the laird.

408
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:04,203
Yeah, I'll try.

409
00:22:04,204 --> 00:22:06,873
But this guy's a real
jumped-up little jobsworth.

410
00:22:06,874 --> 00:22:09,743
- Good morning.
- Hello. did you have a comfortable night?

411
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:12,312
- Adequate.
- Where do you want to start?

412
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:14,748
I noticed from
your literature

413
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:18,151
that, quote, "Glenbogle House
offers chainsaw sculpting

414
00:22:18,152 --> 00:22:22,288
for beginners under instruction
from our trained head ranger. "

415
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:23,323
<i>Unquote.</i>

416
00:22:23,324 --> 00:22:24,691
I'd like instruction.

417
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:44,511
My turn now?

418
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:45,545
Sorry?

419
00:22:45,546 --> 00:22:48,381
I said, is it
my turn now?

420
00:22:48,382 --> 00:22:49,315
Yes, of course.

421
00:23:01,228 --> 00:23:03,129
You've forgotten
something.

422
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:08,869
Safety helmet,

423
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,770
ear defenders,

424
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:11,972
gloves,

425
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,272
safety boots. what?

426
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:14,440
Petrol.

427
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:16,843
Yeah, it's
correctly stored.

428
00:23:16,844 --> 00:23:19,112
It should be
in the chainsaw.

429
00:23:19,113 --> 00:23:21,147
<i>That's why it
won't work.</i>

430
00:23:28,823 --> 00:23:31,391
- Where do we keep the oysters?
- In the fridge.

431
00:23:31,392 --> 00:23:33,593
We've not had any
in weeks, though.

432
00:23:33,594 --> 00:23:36,462
What're you doing?

433
00:23:36,463 --> 00:23:39,165
I found this-

434
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:43,603
the ultimate recipe
for a night of love.

435
00:23:43,604 --> 00:23:47,040
Aye, and it says oysters
are a- a aphro-something.

436
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,075
That's a hairstyle.

437
00:23:49,076 --> 00:23:51,578
No, no, no.
The love thing.

438
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:54,848
Duncan, these magazines
are rubbish.

439
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:56,082
No one ever does this.

440
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,617
What am I supposed to do?

441
00:23:57,618 --> 00:24:00,153
What do you usually do
when you take a lassie out?

442
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:01,454
I don't know.

443
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:02,822
What'd you do
the last time?

444
00:24:02,823 --> 00:24:04,123
Went to the sweet shop.

445
00:24:05,826 --> 00:24:07,326
We were 10.

446
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:11,130
Look, Duncan, there's no
secret. Just be yourself.

447
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:12,699
Now that could
be a problem.

448
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,868
Marie-Helene thinks
he's the laird.

449
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:17,871
Aye, and I promised her
a big special day out.

450
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:20,440
How do you think Marie-Helene
would like to spend the day?

451
00:24:20,441 --> 00:24:22,175
I'm not sure.

452
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:24,878
Well, then do what
you want to do,

453
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:27,480
not what it says
in some magazine.

454
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:31,985
The most exciting, romantic,
magical thing that you can think of.

455
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:46,365
No!

456
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:49,402
( laughing )

457
00:24:58,479 --> 00:25:01,380
- So far, so good.
- You think so?

458
00:25:01,381 --> 00:25:03,549
It's nothing that can
close us down.

459
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:07,386
That's the hard bit. Next
two miles are downhill.

460
00:25:07,387 --> 00:25:08,622
( barr groans )

461
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:09,723
Oh, my word!

462
00:25:09,724 --> 00:25:11,024
<i>Help me!</i>

463
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,794
Oh, fantastic!
You've killed him.

464
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:22,568
- He stopped breathing.
- What do we do?

465
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:24,838
I'll give him heart massage,
you do mouth to mouth.

466
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,773
I'll do the heart massage.

467
00:25:26,774 --> 00:25:28,374
Oh, all right.

468
00:25:30,544 --> 00:25:33,279
- You got a handkerchief?
- No. quick!

469
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,986
- Aren't you going to check my pulse first?
- What?

470
00:25:39,987 --> 00:25:43,890
A registered first-aider needs to
brush up on his cpr skills, doesn't he?

471
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:51,131
( laughing )

472
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:55,969
Duncan: Hold on, I've
got a present for you.

473
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:05,478
This is traditional
Scottish.

474
00:26:12,853 --> 00:26:14,020
( laughing )

475
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:19,159
You're so pretty.

476
00:26:21,662 --> 00:26:24,764
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- Of course.

477
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:29,135
Is this all yours?

478
00:26:29,136 --> 00:26:31,270
Uh-huh.

479
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:34,440
It's so much
for one person.

480
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:38,311
I hope it won't
always be for one.

481
00:26:40,514 --> 00:26:41,881
You've got girlfriends?

482
00:26:41,882 --> 00:26:44,684
Well, no,
actually.

483
00:26:44,685 --> 00:26:48,154
I've always been waiting
for the right one.

484
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:01,000
Where have I seen
Mr. Barr before?

485
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:02,736
Your worst nightmares.

486
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:04,704
Oh, is the inspection
not going well?

487
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:05,905
<i>( alarm sounds )</i>

488
00:27:05,906 --> 00:27:07,240
That must be him.

489
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:08,574
Is there a fire?

490
00:27:08,575 --> 00:27:10,744
No, just another one
of his safety tests.

491
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:11,811
Oh.

492
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:12,812
Oh, Archie-

493
00:27:12,813 --> 00:27:14,280
you've got
to leave the house.

494
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:15,815
But you said
there isn't a fire.

495
00:27:15,816 --> 00:27:18,651
The house is in flames, you're
going to be burned to a frazzle.

496
00:27:18,652 --> 00:27:19,853
Oh, why didn't
you tell me?

497
00:27:19,854 --> 00:27:21,755
You know how
panicked I get.

498
00:27:21,756 --> 00:27:23,957
Stella, get
the fire engines.

499
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,359
No, our fire engine.
Bring it round the front.

500
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,327
- Me?
- I've got to check the rooms.

501
00:27:28,328 --> 00:27:30,663
The fire drill is one thing
that I can do.

502
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:34,600
Mother!

503
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:37,771
Your father would never forgive
me if I didn't save the imperial.

504
00:27:37,772 --> 00:27:39,272
<i>( alarm continuing )</i>

505
00:27:39,273 --> 00:27:40,573
What's that noise?

506
00:27:40,574 --> 00:27:41,941
That'd be the fire bell.

507
00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:43,376
Shouldn't we
do something?

508
00:27:43,377 --> 00:27:44,944
No, it's no bother.

509
00:27:44,945 --> 00:27:47,247
There's something
I've got to say.

510
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,082
Marie-Helene,

511
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:52,118
I've always dreamed
that one day

512
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:55,088
I would meet someone
who would change my life.

513
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:57,090
You think you have
found her?

514
00:27:57,091 --> 00:27:58,324
I know I have.

515
00:27:58,325 --> 00:28:00,226
Oh, Duncan,
I'm so happy.

516
00:28:00,227 --> 00:28:01,294
Marie-Helene-

517
00:28:01,295 --> 00:28:02,495
<i>Stella:
Duncan!</i>

518
00:28:02,496 --> 00:28:04,363
Duncan, I need you!

519
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:12,738
There's a fire. We have
to leave the building now.

520
00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:14,440
You sure it's not
a false alarm?

521
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:16,943
You'd know better than me,
wouldn't you? We have to go.

522
00:28:16,944 --> 00:28:20,413
- I need to get dressed first.
- I have three minutes to evacuate the house.

523
00:28:20,414 --> 00:28:22,182
I'm not leaving
without my trousers.

524
00:28:22,183 --> 00:28:25,551
- Sorry, but rules are rules.
- ( tearing )

525
00:28:27,354 --> 00:28:29,522
Put me down!

526
00:28:29,523 --> 00:28:31,424
Put me down, I said!

527
00:28:31,425 --> 00:28:33,159
( sirens blaring )

528
00:28:41,168 --> 00:28:42,936
We need to check
the water tanks.

529
00:28:42,937 --> 00:28:44,904
There's no time for that, get the hose.


530
00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:46,639
I do hope it's not
a big fire.

531
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,842
Hector will be terribly
disappointed to miss it.

532
00:28:51,478 --> 00:28:53,346
Put me down!

533
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,019
Okay!

534
00:29:15,903 --> 00:29:18,071
Is this
the fire brigade?

535
00:29:18,072 --> 00:29:22,375
By my watch the house was completely
evacuated in under three minutes,

536
00:29:22,376 --> 00:29:25,578
<i>which is well within
the required time.</i>

537
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:27,347
You want to put that
in your safety report?

538
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:30,416
Fire precautions
are out with my remit.

539
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:31,484
What?

540
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:34,520
I didn't set off
the alarm.

541
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:37,290
And I thought you'd
fully evacuated the house.

542
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:40,226
I'm terribly sorry,

543
00:29:40,227 --> 00:29:44,397
but I tripped one of the
detectors with my blowtorch.

544
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,233
<i>You can all
come back in now.</i>

545
00:29:54,508 --> 00:29:56,209
Great.

546
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,977
In the course
of my inspection,

547
00:29:57,978 --> 00:30:01,747
I have found no fewer
than 73 contraventions

548
00:30:01,748 --> 00:30:03,582
<i>of health and safety
regulations.</i>

549
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:06,019
That doesn't include
the failure to ensure

550
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,587
the house was evacuated
during the fire alert.

551
00:30:08,588 --> 00:30:11,024
I shall not require
the premises to close down...

552
00:30:11,025 --> 00:30:13,326
thank you.

553
00:30:13,327 --> 00:30:15,261
...until tomorrow a. m.

554
00:30:15,262 --> 00:30:19,065
I then recommend that Glenbogle
House should remain closed

555
00:30:19,066 --> 00:30:22,802
<i>until all improvements,
as listed, have been made.</i>

556
00:30:22,803 --> 00:30:25,571
<i>Finally, I should
strongly suggest</i>

557
00:30:25,572 --> 00:30:28,174
that you dismiss
your head ranger forthwith.

558
00:30:28,175 --> 00:30:31,877
However admirable your equal
opportunities policies may be

559
00:30:31,878 --> 00:30:34,047
<i>in regard to his
mental health issues,</i>

560
00:30:34,048 --> 00:30:36,349
he would appear to be
not only incompetent,

561
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,284
but positively
dangerous.

562
00:30:38,285 --> 00:30:41,087
<i>That's the summary
of my findings.</i>

563
00:30:41,088 --> 00:30:43,789
You'll have my
full report tomorrow.

564
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,224
Thank you.

565
00:31:02,742 --> 00:31:04,577
Did you enjoy today?

566
00:31:04,578 --> 00:31:07,213
Oh, it was fantastic.

567
00:31:13,653 --> 00:31:16,255
There was something I
wanted to say to you earlier.

568
00:31:16,256 --> 00:31:17,556
I think you know
what it is.

569
00:31:17,557 --> 00:31:20,926
<i>We've only been
together for a day,</i>

570
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:22,895
<i>but in a way we've known
each other for years.</i>

571
00:31:22,896 --> 00:31:25,131
I've always thought
of you as my best friend,

572
00:31:25,132 --> 00:31:27,967
but now that we've met,
you could be-

573
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:32,438
<i>you are more than that.
Marie-Helene... I love you.</i>

574
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:38,478
Duncan, you're teasing.
This is one of your jokes.

575
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,713
No, no, I mean it,

576
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:44,583
I know that you're beginning
to feel the same towards me.

577
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:48,287
Duncan, I'm sorry-

578
00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:50,623
no, you don't have
to decide just now.

579
00:31:50,624 --> 00:31:53,993
I know I'm not great
looking or a big genius,

580
00:31:53,994 --> 00:31:56,662
but I could look after you,
I could make you happy.

581
00:31:57,731 --> 00:32:00,133
Duncan, I really like you.

582
00:32:00,134 --> 00:32:02,935
You're my friend,
my best friend.

583
00:32:02,936 --> 00:32:06,139
<i>The one person I could
always talk to,</i>

584
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,142
but... you're not
Alain.

585
00:32:09,143 --> 00:32:12,811
But you said
that was all over.

586
00:32:12,812 --> 00:32:15,648
It might be for him,
but I still love him.

587
00:32:17,484 --> 00:32:19,752
<i>I miss him so much.</i>

588
00:32:22,156 --> 00:32:24,690
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

589
00:32:24,691 --> 00:32:27,093
<i>I didn't want
to hurt you.</i>

590
00:32:27,094 --> 00:32:28,761
No.

591
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:31,830
I'm sorry.

592
00:32:31,831 --> 00:32:33,299
Sorry.

593
00:32:42,943 --> 00:32:45,744
No, I need to speak
to him now.

594
00:32:45,745 --> 00:32:46,946
( knocking )

595
00:32:46,947 --> 00:32:48,381
( softly )
I'll come back.

596
00:32:48,382 --> 00:32:50,616
No, it's okay.
It's the lawyers.

597
00:32:50,617 --> 00:32:52,285
I could be
on hold all week.

598
00:32:52,286 --> 00:32:55,588
Which do you think?
This or this?

599
00:32:55,589 --> 00:32:56,889
Where are you going?

600
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,824
You said to give it a go
with Archie,

601
00:32:58,825 --> 00:33:00,259
tonight's the night.

602
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,263
Well, he might not be
in the best of moods.

603
00:33:04,264 --> 00:33:07,032
Well, he might need
a shoulder to cry on.

604
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:10,703
Look, I couldn't borrow something
of yours, could I? I'm sick of these.

605
00:33:10,704 --> 00:33:12,505
Sure.

606
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,948
Oh, it's really nice.

607
00:33:22,949 --> 00:33:25,251
- That's not very me.
- It's very Archie.

608
00:33:25,252 --> 00:33:28,454
All right,
I'll give it a try.

609
00:33:28,455 --> 00:33:29,622
<i>Thanks.</i>

610
00:33:29,623 --> 00:33:31,190
Wish me luck.

611
00:33:35,962 --> 00:33:37,763
( knocking )

612
00:33:42,136 --> 00:33:43,603
<i>Archie: Lexie.</i>

613
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,538
Were you expecting
someone more exciting?

614
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:48,307
I wasn't expecting
anyone at all. come in.

615
00:33:52,712 --> 00:33:54,813
I'm not
disturbing you, am I?

616
00:33:54,814 --> 00:33:58,317
No, I was just looking
through this safety report.

617
00:33:58,318 --> 00:34:00,153
Can't seem to find
a way around it.

618
00:34:00,154 --> 00:34:02,821
Stella's been on to the lawyers,
I've tried to pull strings.

619
00:34:02,822 --> 00:34:04,890
When it comes down to it,
we have been shafted.

620
00:34:04,891 --> 00:34:06,825
That guy came here
looking to do that.

621
00:34:06,826 --> 00:34:09,028
How sad does your life
have to be to end up

622
00:34:09,029 --> 00:34:11,197
as bitter and twisted
as he is?

623
00:34:11,198 --> 00:34:13,866
I'm well on the way
to finding out.

624
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:15,701
<i>No, I can't blame him.</i>

625
00:34:15,702 --> 00:34:17,836
It's my own fault.
I make a lousy Duncan.

626
00:34:17,837 --> 00:34:19,672
Well, he makes
a pretty good you.

627
00:34:19,673 --> 00:34:21,641
Certainly knows how
to put me in my place.

628
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,043
- Is that what I do?
- All the time.

629
00:34:25,546 --> 00:34:28,347
So, now that I've traipsed
all the way over here,

630
00:34:28,348 --> 00:34:30,783
the least you can do
is offer me some dinner.

631
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:34,253
Okay.
Is that a new dress?

632
00:34:34,254 --> 00:34:37,923
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, you look fantastic.

633
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:02,582
How are the eggs?

634
00:35:05,552 --> 00:35:07,486
Not bad.

635
00:35:07,487 --> 00:35:09,455
You should cook
more often.

636
00:35:09,456 --> 00:35:11,156
Thanks.

637
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:16,061
Forgotten how much
I missed all this.

638
00:35:16,062 --> 00:35:17,963
Scrambled eggs?

639
00:35:17,964 --> 00:35:20,466
No, this.

640
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:23,102
Supper without
dressing up.

641
00:35:23,103 --> 00:35:26,606
And my father banging on about
El-Alamain or the 10th hole...

642
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:28,474
and your cooking.

643
00:35:28,475 --> 00:35:30,042
What's wrong
with my cooking?

644
00:35:30,043 --> 00:35:33,579
There's nothing wrong with
your cooking. It was a joke.

645
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,683
And that was a lie.

646
00:35:37,684 --> 00:35:41,254
You're welcome
to cook anytime.

647
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,891
So, you still nervous
about this inspection?

648
00:35:45,892 --> 00:35:47,993
Thanks for reminding me.

649
00:35:47,994 --> 00:35:49,629
Well, if there's
anything I can do.

650
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,330
No, you've already
done plenty.

651
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:54,967
I hadn't thought about it
for at least a half an hour.

652
00:35:54,968 --> 00:35:57,136
It's funny, being down
here away from the house

653
00:35:57,137 --> 00:36:01,240
<i>helps put things
into perspective.</i>

654
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:04,577
It's very easy to lose sight
of what's important.

655
00:36:06,713 --> 00:36:10,716
So, what's important
to you?

656
00:36:10,717 --> 00:36:13,152
Scrambled eggs,
mainly.

657
00:36:13,153 --> 00:36:17,790
- Be serious.
- My family,

658
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:20,793
the estate, friends.

659
00:36:20,794 --> 00:36:23,696
Is that enough?

660
00:36:23,697 --> 00:36:25,464
For what?

661
00:36:25,465 --> 00:36:29,802
To... you know,
make you happy?

662
00:36:29,803 --> 00:36:32,672
Don't really know.

663
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,344
What about you?

664
00:36:38,345 --> 00:36:40,946
The same.

665
00:36:40,947 --> 00:36:44,717
I mean, I guess
I want a family...

666
00:36:44,718 --> 00:36:46,185
and kids.

667
00:36:46,186 --> 00:36:50,055
That does usually require
some sort of a male input.

668
00:36:50,056 --> 00:36:53,326
<i>Well, you males think far
too much about your input.</i>

669
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:56,329
- Me?
- Yes, you.

670
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,631
( laughing )

671
00:36:58,632 --> 00:37:02,968
Sorry, I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

672
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:05,604
Look, I know it's late,
but I really need

673
00:37:05,605 --> 00:37:07,740
to speak to Archie
about what the lawyer said.

674
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:08,941
Right, yeah.

675
00:37:08,942 --> 00:37:12,812
Why don't I make
some coffee first? Lex?

676
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,046
Please.

677
00:37:16,383 --> 00:37:18,050
That would be great,
thanks.

678
00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:30,363
So, how's it going then?

679
00:37:33,132 --> 00:37:34,367
( knocking )

680
00:37:34,368 --> 00:37:36,902
<i>Molly: Mr. Barr?</i>

681
00:37:36,903 --> 00:37:38,704
Hello.

682
00:37:38,705 --> 00:37:40,673
Your trousers- oh.

683
00:37:40,674 --> 00:37:45,878
I did my best, but needlework
has never been my forte.

684
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:46,912
Thank you.

685
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:51,650
<i>Oh, is that
Mrs. Barr?</i>

686
00:37:51,651 --> 00:37:53,051
Yes.

687
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:55,755
That's the Glenbogle rose.

688
00:37:55,756 --> 00:37:57,923
When was it you were
here before?

689
00:37:57,924 --> 00:38:01,059
- A very long time ago.
- May I?

690
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,898
Oh, she's a very
attractive woman.

691
00:38:05,899 --> 00:38:08,768
She was then-
and she still is.

692
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:10,770
Was this a special
occasion?

693
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:14,840
You could say that.
It was for me, anyway.

694
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,043
Good night, Mr. Barr.

695
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,805
Duncan...?

696
00:38:48,442 --> 00:38:50,275
Tell me.

697
00:38:52,946 --> 00:38:55,347
What is it
about me?

698
00:38:55,348 --> 00:38:57,817
I thought that
if I had a better job,

699
00:38:57,818 --> 00:39:02,387
or a big house, or a fancy car,
then I'd get a girlfriend.

700
00:39:02,388 --> 00:39:06,759
I'm the laird of Glenbogle
and she's still not interested.

701
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,464
- What is it?
- What happened?

702
00:39:11,465 --> 00:39:15,501
I told her how I felt about her.
She thought it was a joke.

703
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:19,204
- What's wrong with me?
- There's nothing wrong with you.

704
00:39:19,205 --> 00:39:21,106
You'll find
someone else.

705
00:39:21,107 --> 00:39:24,543
I don't want someone else. I want her.

706
00:39:27,848 --> 00:39:30,783
Well, sometimes
that just can't happen.

707
00:39:30,784 --> 00:39:33,418
You know,
you love someone,

708
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:35,888
<i>and they just
can't see it,</i>

709
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:38,056
<i>or they want
other things.</i>

710
00:39:38,057 --> 00:39:41,594
And other people
get in the way.

711
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:43,261
You're just
saying that.

712
00:39:43,262 --> 00:39:45,364
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

713
00:39:45,365 --> 00:39:49,034
It takes two to tango,

714
00:39:49,035 --> 00:39:52,505
<i>and one half
fallen in love...</i>

715
00:39:52,506 --> 00:39:54,673
just isn't enough.

716
00:39:58,411 --> 00:40:00,946
Tell me all about it. We'll
try and work something out.

717
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:06,418
Is that a new dress?

718
00:40:07,587 --> 00:40:09,555
Do you like it?

719
00:40:09,556 --> 00:40:12,525
Yes. you look great.

720
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:29,642
- Morning, lass.
- Good morning.

721
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:31,944
You're not going to need
that at breakfast.

722
00:40:31,945 --> 00:40:33,345
- I'll take that.
- No, no, really-

723
00:40:33,346 --> 00:40:35,681
- it's too heavy.
- Thank you.

724
00:40:35,682 --> 00:40:37,650
Not at all.

725
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:48,093
- Hi.
- Hi.

726
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,231
What are you
making?

727
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:54,867
Eggs.

728
00:40:54,868 --> 00:40:58,270
You should do it.
You're the expert.

729
00:40:58,271 --> 00:41:00,105
It's different
down here.

730
00:41:00,106 --> 00:41:02,808
I noticed.

731
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:06,912
Thanks for
last night.

732
00:41:06,913 --> 00:41:10,415
Look, I'm sorry it ended the way it did,

733
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:13,586
but, you know,
Stella was worried.

734
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:17,056
So she should be.
Her timing's terrible.

735
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:21,359
Hmm. we had fun,
didn't we?

736
00:41:23,897 --> 00:41:26,999
I wish things could always be like that
- just simple.

737
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,867
Who are you
calling "simple"?

738
00:41:30,403 --> 00:41:33,438
The girl that just broke
an egg into a mug of tea.

739
00:41:41,648 --> 00:41:43,882
Is it there?

740
00:41:43,883 --> 00:41:45,350
I can't find it.

741
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:47,319
Let me look.

742
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,554
Get away.

743
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,662
- Here it is.
- I cannot do this.

744
00:41:56,663 --> 00:41:59,331
I'll make the call.
All you have to do

745
00:41:59,332 --> 00:42:01,333
is keep Marie-Helene here
as long as you can.

746
00:42:01,334 --> 00:42:04,569
- Lexie's going to help too-
- what if it doesn't work?

747
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,940
You have to make it work.
You've lied to that girl,

748
00:42:07,941 --> 00:42:09,908
in your letters,
and ever since she came here.

749
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:12,577
Look at the mess
both of you are in.

750
00:42:12,578 --> 00:42:14,446
Now you owe it to her

751
00:42:14,447 --> 00:42:16,581
<i>to do the right thing.</i>

752
00:42:19,085 --> 00:42:21,820
This seems pretty
comprehensive.

753
00:42:21,821 --> 00:42:26,458
Congratulations, Mr. Barr. You've
almost certainly closed us for good.

754
00:42:26,459 --> 00:42:28,260
Well, that's not
my problem.

755
00:42:28,261 --> 00:42:31,263
Not until you've closed every
business in the highlands.

756
00:42:31,264 --> 00:42:33,198
<i>Then you might find
yourself out of a job.</i>

757
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:35,901
I'd say you were in more
danger of that than me.

758
00:42:35,902 --> 00:42:37,836
<i>Good day.</i>

759
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,875
Mr. Barr, I need
to talk to you.

760
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:45,277
I was arrogant
and inexcusably rude.

761
00:42:45,278 --> 00:42:47,512
I also haven't been telling
the truth about things.

762
00:42:47,513 --> 00:42:50,149
I am, in fact,
the laird of Glenbogle.

763
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,350
I swapped jobs
with my head ranger

764
00:42:52,351 --> 00:42:54,519
because his French
pen pal had come to visit.

765
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,222
And the whole thing
with the lifebelt,

766
00:42:57,223 --> 00:42:59,224
my brother drowned in the
loch, so I get very angry

767
00:42:59,225 --> 00:43:01,426
if anybody suggests that
I don't care about safety.

768
00:43:01,427 --> 00:43:03,796
The truth is that my
father has had an operation.

769
00:43:03,797 --> 00:43:05,898
My mother took the lifebelt
so he could sit on it.

770
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:08,867
Mrs. MacDonald told me
about your condition.

771
00:43:08,868 --> 00:43:12,004
- I do understand.
- What condition?

772
00:43:12,005 --> 00:43:13,605
The mental health issue.

773
00:43:13,606 --> 00:43:14,673
You think I'm crazy?

774
00:43:14,674 --> 00:43:16,408
No more so than
anyone else around here.

775
00:43:16,409 --> 00:43:18,343
Would you excuse me?

776
00:43:29,756 --> 00:43:32,091
Thank you.

777
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:33,959
I want to leave
as soon as possible.

778
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,294
You have to have
breakfast first.

779
00:43:36,295 --> 00:43:38,563
I don't want
to see Duncan.

780
00:43:38,564 --> 00:43:40,632
I can't explain.

781
00:43:40,633 --> 00:43:42,701
There's a train at 10:00.
I'd like to take it.

782
00:43:42,702 --> 00:43:45,170
Don't worry because if you miss
that one, there's plenty more.

783
00:43:45,171 --> 00:43:47,239
Not on the timetable.

784
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,406
Oh!

785
00:43:48,407 --> 00:43:50,475
You don't want to go
looking at that, do you?

786
00:43:50,476 --> 00:43:52,177
Now, come on,
eat up.

787
00:43:52,178 --> 00:43:55,413
Because we've got
kidneys still to come.

788
00:43:55,414 --> 00:43:56,715
<i>Oh...</i>

789
00:43:58,618 --> 00:44:00,185
and toast.

790
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:08,093
Molly: It would be
easier with secateurs.

791
00:44:08,094 --> 00:44:09,895
I can explain.

792
00:44:09,896 --> 00:44:12,765
No need.
I know already.

793
00:44:12,766 --> 00:44:14,733
You were planning
a trip to Devon,

794
00:44:14,734 --> 00:44:17,502
and you wanted to take a bunch
of Glenbogle roses with you.

795
00:44:17,503 --> 00:44:20,839
- How did you know that?
- Because we've met before, Mr. Barr.

796
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,243
It was exactly 25 years ago
in this garden.

797
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:27,545
I took the photograph of you and
Mona that you have by your bed.

798
00:44:27,546 --> 00:44:31,950
- You know her name?
- It's all here, in my journal.

799
00:44:31,951 --> 00:44:34,019
I wrote about how
a young man

800
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,688
proposed to his girlfriend,
Mona, in our garden.

801
00:44:36,689 --> 00:44:38,523
<i>During one of our
open days.</i>

802
00:44:38,524 --> 00:44:41,760
She told me all about it when she
asked me to take the photograph.

803
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:46,198
<i>I guessed that you wanted to take
your Mona a reminder of that day.</i>

804
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:49,268
Here, let me.

805
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:56,341
Did you think your wife
might change her mind?

806
00:44:56,342 --> 00:44:57,609
Come back to you?

807
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,945
- It sounds pretty stupid.
- Not at all.

808
00:44:59,946 --> 00:45:02,815
I think it's the most
wonderful, romantic gesture.

809
00:45:02,816 --> 00:45:04,616
A crime of passion.

810
00:45:04,617 --> 00:45:07,886
And I know how you feel.

811
00:45:07,887 --> 00:45:10,622
With respect,
you don't.

812
00:45:10,623 --> 00:45:12,357
<i>Mona walked out on me</i>

813
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:16,929
without a word
after 22 years.

814
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:18,763
You have no idea.

815
00:45:18,764 --> 00:45:20,966
I do-
of course, I do.

816
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:23,501
The same thing
happened to me.

817
00:45:23,502 --> 00:45:25,737
<i>My husband, Hector,</i>

818
00:45:25,738 --> 00:45:29,041
he- he left me...

819
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:31,243
<i>for an upholsterer
in Lossiemouth.</i>

820
00:45:31,244 --> 00:45:34,112
He's probably pumping up
her cushions as we speak.

821
00:45:34,113 --> 00:45:37,149
I'm sorry,
I spoke out of turn.

822
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,184
I love my Hector,
I still do.

823
00:45:39,185 --> 00:45:41,820
He was a colossus mentally,
physically, spiritually,

824
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:44,890
and when he left, I-
I couldn't cope.

825
00:45:44,891 --> 00:45:46,859
<i>The house went
to wrack and ruin,</i>

826
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,795
the staff out of control,
but Hector loves this house.

827
00:45:50,796 --> 00:45:53,232
And if I can just keep it
going, maybe one day

828
00:45:53,233 --> 00:45:56,501
he'll return to the place
where he was truly happy.

829
00:45:58,238 --> 00:46:00,638
Wouldn't it be
wonderful

830
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:03,175
<i>if we were able to help
one another in some way?</i>

831
00:46:16,322 --> 00:46:18,456
Can't that wait
a minute, dear?

832
00:46:18,457 --> 00:46:21,426
- I've got to tell the bank the estate's closed.
- There's no need to.

833
00:46:21,427 --> 00:46:24,897
Mr. Barr has given us
six month's grace.

834
00:46:24,898 --> 00:46:28,400
I simply found the words
to make him feel better.

835
00:46:28,401 --> 00:46:30,668
And in a way,
your father helped, too.

836
00:46:32,972 --> 00:46:35,107
<i>Mother,
you're a genius.</i>

837
00:46:39,445 --> 00:46:41,179
Marie-Helene:
When is the train?

838
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,181
There's something
I've got to tell you.

839
00:46:43,182 --> 00:46:45,183
Duncan, I already
told you.

840
00:46:45,184 --> 00:46:47,052
You know how I feel
about Alain.

841
00:46:47,053 --> 00:46:48,853
So you did.

842
00:46:48,854 --> 00:46:51,523
There's someone going in
the same direction as you,

843
00:46:51,524 --> 00:46:54,026
someone to share
your journey home with.

844
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:02,867
Alain?

845
00:47:02,868 --> 00:47:07,472
I phoned him.
He was worried sick.

846
00:47:07,473 --> 00:47:10,275
You did this for me?

847
00:47:16,316 --> 00:47:19,184
What do I say
to him?

848
00:47:19,185 --> 00:47:21,186
Tell him you don't care
if you get married

849
00:47:21,187 --> 00:47:22,787
in a church
or a kite shop,

850
00:47:22,788 --> 00:47:25,924
life's no fun
without him.

851
00:47:25,925 --> 00:47:27,625
Tell him
you love him.

852
00:48:02,428 --> 00:48:04,796
I borrowed this top.
Is that okay?

853
00:48:04,797 --> 00:48:07,532
No worries.
Where are you going?

854
00:48:07,533 --> 00:48:09,868
Out for a drink
with Archie.

855
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:11,503
Now we're not
closing down,

856
00:48:11,504 --> 00:48:14,506
- we need to talk about a business plan.
- In that top?

857
00:48:16,442 --> 00:48:18,543
Well,
it's very pretty.

858
00:48:18,544 --> 00:48:21,313
Then you won't mind
if I come too, then.

859
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,322
Go on then, girl.
Age before beauty.

860
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,262
