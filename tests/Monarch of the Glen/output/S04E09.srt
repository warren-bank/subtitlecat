1
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,167
<i>Golly:
He looks in a bad way.</i>

2
00:00:18,837 --> 00:00:21,772
<i>Of all the beasts
in the world,</i>

3
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:23,808
<i>it had to be you,
Big Eric.</i>

4
00:00:27,412 --> 00:00:30,080
<i>Duncan: He's well off the beaten track.</i>

5
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:31,582
<i>Where's he come from?</i>

6
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,484
<i>Duncan, bullets.</i>

7
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:35,352
- Bullets?
- Bullets.

8
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:39,356
- You've got them.
- If I had them would I be asking you for them?

9
00:00:39,357 --> 00:00:41,158
Do you want me
to get some?

10
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,695
No, son, I'm going to sit here and
wait till the beast comes to me.

11
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:47,632
Then I'm going to put him out of
his misery with a few harsh words.

12
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:49,567
<i>- ( laughs )
- Go.</i>

13
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,814
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

14
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:05,476
What on earth
are you playing at?

15
00:02:05,477 --> 00:02:08,912
No, I think
it's all right.

16
00:02:08,913 --> 00:02:11,748
<i>Lexie: Okay, back,
back. Back, back, back.</i>

17
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:15,186
Back, back,
keep coming, keep coming.

18
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:17,221
Oh, stop, stop!
Stop there.

19
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,392
Have you ever
reversed in before?

20
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:26,763
One very big haggis.

21
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:29,166
Do you know how much this
fridge unit's costing us?

22
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:31,268
And he nearly
slams it into the wall.

23
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:33,504
- What are you grinning at?
- You...

24
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:37,508
and how deep down I know you're
enjoying every minute of this.

25
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:40,277
Could you plug this into
the kitchen for me please?

26
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:42,346
Be careful
with the haggis.

27
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:45,849
I quite like you when you're
in your organizing mode.

28
00:02:49,787 --> 00:02:52,256
- Who's that?
- Don't know.

29
00:02:56,194 --> 00:02:58,229
<i>Are you lost?
Can we help at all?</i>

30
00:02:59,698 --> 00:03:01,732
I'm looking
for this man.

31
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:04,935
<i>Lexie:
It's Golly, isn't it?</i>

32
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:08,205
( chuckles )

33
00:03:08,206 --> 00:03:11,675
Golly's up in the hills somewhere. it
might be some time before he's back.

34
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:15,512
Where?

35
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:18,749
They headed to Raglan Glen,
up there.

36
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,317
Thanks.

37
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:22,319
It'd be nice to know
who's asking for him.

38
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,588
Paul... Bowman.

39
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:26,657
And how do you
know Golly?

40
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:29,560
I don't.

41
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:33,464
- Archie, I need to get a number off you for the band.
- Hang on a minute.

42
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:35,198
Morning, Archie.

43
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:38,168
Morning.

44
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:40,504
- Morning, Archie.
- Morning.

45
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:55,352
I've been helping you organize
the Ghillie's Ball for years now.

46
00:03:55,353 --> 00:03:57,354
Ah, but this year
you're the host.

47
00:03:57,355 --> 00:03:58,822
And with Irene gone-

48
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:01,091
it's just a traditional ball.
So it's going to be

49
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:04,561
the same as it was last year and the year
before that, and the year before that.

50
00:04:04,562 --> 00:04:07,063
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

51
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:08,965
Oops.

52
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:11,669
Right here...
would be good.

53
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,638
And then the waitresses can serve
drinks as the guests come in.

54
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,540
Would you like any
help in the kitchen?

55
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,375
Things aren't
that bad just yet.

56
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:21,978
Don't worry, everything's
in hand. Honestly.

57
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:23,980
<i>- Morning.
- Morning.</i>

58
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:27,150
I thought the boarders of the
old jardin might need a haircut.

59
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:29,553
That's very kind of you
to offer, Kilwillie.

60
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:31,121
Oh, no.
I didn't mean-

61
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:33,023
I meant you could
borrow it, that's all.

62
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:35,559
Really no need. Andrew lent
me his just the other day.

63
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,728
- Oh.
- Trust it did the job.

64
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:39,330
It certainly did.
Now you're here.

65
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:42,165
Kilwillie, do you want
to stay and be a helper, too?

66
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,968
Could you define helper
a bit more clearly?

67
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:46,269
Well, to begin with,

68
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,672
all those chairs have got
to be moved round the tables.

69
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:51,408
- And then-
- thing is I've got a very-

70
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:54,177
oh, well,
you know me.

71
00:04:54,178 --> 00:04:57,113
Always ready to lend
a helping hand.

72
00:04:57,114 --> 00:04:59,082
( chuckles )
I'm sorry, Molly-

73
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:02,319
who the dickens
is he?

74
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,921
Andrew,
as I said.

75
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:07,023
Andrew.

76
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:09,926
Right!

77
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:18,369
You should leave a few
of these unshelled.

78
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,070
It really sets
the plates off.

79
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:23,306
( clears throat ) Isn't there something
else you could be getting on with?

80
00:05:23,307 --> 00:05:27,177
No, no, no. I've got the
whole day clear for you.

81
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:29,847
I even told Golly and Duncan I
couldn't go stalking with them.

82
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:31,915
<i>( car approaching )</i>

83
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,550
Huh, I wonder
what he's doing back.

84
00:05:38,723 --> 00:05:40,957
Give me
one minute, okay?

85
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:44,294
Take your time.

86
00:05:51,235 --> 00:05:54,204
I thought you were
up on the hill.

87
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:57,173
No, boss,
I'm here.

88
00:05:57,174 --> 00:05:59,676
I was just wondering why.

89
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:02,212
Saw Big Eric...

90
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:04,882
injured pretty bad.

91
00:06:04,883 --> 00:06:06,683
Are you sure it was him?

92
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:09,152
Yeah, I think one
of the younger stags

93
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:11,288
gave him more than he
bargained for in the rut.

94
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:13,457
Golly thinks we should
put him out of his misery.

95
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,592
So why didn't you
just take the shot?

96
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:18,929
Um...

97
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:21,598
Dunc, what are you
looking for?

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,334
Ammunition.

99
00:06:31,075 --> 00:06:33,810
Boys, I've got
a job for somebody.

100
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,312
Both:
Certainly.

101
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:37,981
There's a box in the attic
with all the table decorations.

102
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,916
Both:
I'll go.

103
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:42,185
On second thought,
it's really a two-man job.

104
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:44,087
What sort of box?

105
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:46,890
I'm not sure, really.
A small box I think.

106
00:06:46,891 --> 00:06:48,459
But it's very heavy.

107
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,427
We'll find it
I'm sure, dear Molly.

108
00:06:50,428 --> 00:06:51,895
It could be
under some things.

109
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:53,297
We'll be back
in a trice.

110
00:06:53,298 --> 00:06:56,233
So it's a small box
under some things.

111
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:58,235
Yes.

112
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:03,874
- Molly.
- Yes?

113
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,076
I just wanted
to be absolutely sure-

114
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:08,979
everything in the garden's
rosy, isn't it?

115
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,482
Well, apart from
the rosa mundi having a touch-

116
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:13,417
no, no,
I meant between us-

117
00:07:15,153 --> 00:07:18,255
after the proposal.

118
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:20,691
- Of course.
- Because we did agree that we wouldn't

119
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:22,626
let it stop us being chums,
didn't we?

120
00:07:22,627 --> 00:07:24,762
As far as I'm concerned,
Kilwillie,

121
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:26,830
nothing will ever change.

122
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:30,534
Where is the attic?

123
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:32,503
Top of the house,
dear boy. it usually is.

124
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:41,812
<i>Okay.</i>

125
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:43,814
Good.

126
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:46,583
Okay, give me your hand
and I'll pull you up.

127
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:49,186
I'm fine.
I have scaled Ben Nevis.

128
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:50,921
I think I can
manage this.

129
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:54,825
I was in the Himalayas about five
years back. You ever climbed there?

130
00:07:54,826 --> 00:07:56,760
Well, not recently.

131
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:05,235
Well, pull, man, pull!

132
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:10,307
So he definitely
has to be culled?

133
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:12,042
From what Duncan says.

134
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:15,412
It's silly, but it feels
like losing one of the family.

135
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:18,849
I better get going.
The sooner I'm gone,

136
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,484
the sooner I'll
be back to help.

137
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:22,419
She so wants this evening
to be a success,

138
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,655
but honestly, Archie,
I could have never coped

139
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:26,690
<i>on my own like she's
trying to do.</i>

140
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:29,660
Just do what you can. She'll
thank you for it in the end.

141
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,937
Molly, did Archie leave
the number for the band?

142
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,506
Was he supposed to?

143
00:08:45,477 --> 00:08:47,778
( sighs )
Fine.

144
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,635
Do you know,

145
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:58,405
I think our search would be
more profitable at the other end.

146
00:09:58,406 --> 00:10:00,875
- Perhaps we should admit defeat.
- Nonsense!

147
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:02,743
If you knew Molly
half as well as I do,

148
00:10:02,744 --> 00:10:05,179
you'd know that defeat is
not a word in her vocabulary.

149
00:10:07,115 --> 00:10:10,484
You're rather close
to Molly, aren't you?

150
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,053
Perhaps none so close,
though I say it myself.

151
00:10:14,422 --> 00:10:16,323
And she never
mentioned me to you?

152
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,993
No.

153
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,627
Good grief!

154
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:23,164
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just-
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,266
Yes, well,

156
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:28,836
perhaps we should concentrate
on the matter in hand.

157
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,337
Not that one.

158
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:38,478
So now what?

159
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:42,016
Simply have to open it
from this side.

160
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:55,963
- Help! Help!
- Help! Help!

161
00:10:55,964 --> 00:10:59,533
<i>- Help!
- Help!</i>

162
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:05,272
There is a track, you know,
if you want to stay on it.

163
00:11:05,273 --> 00:11:09,143
I'll bring him up
once we've got Big Eric.

164
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,789
Do you think
we're a bit stuck?

165
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,659
I think there's
a distinct possibility.

166
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,270
- Thanks.
- 20 cases- 10 red, 10 white.

167
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:38,605
And I don't actually
want it here, though.

168
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:42,343
That's fine.
Just put it-

169
00:11:42,344 --> 00:11:44,544
thanks.
I need this wine lifted

170
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:46,480
to the marquis...

171
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:58,792
Molly?

172
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:00,794
<i>- ( explosion )
- ( Molly screams )</i>

173
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:03,330
<i>( Molly groans )</i>

174
00:12:04,366 --> 00:12:06,500
<i>Woman:
Anybody home?</i>

175
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:08,435
Oh, Molly,

176
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,604
I know we're early,
but I-

177
00:12:12,974 --> 00:12:15,209
I'm afraid
the haggis is off.

178
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,593
<i>Archie:
How bad is he?</i>

179
00:12:33,594 --> 00:12:36,263
He'll not make it through
another winter, that's for sure.

180
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:39,033
And we need
to do it today.

181
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:40,901
I'll not let
the beast suffer.

182
00:12:40,902 --> 00:12:42,869
I'd like to be the one
who takes the shot.

183
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,738
Of course.

184
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:46,640
Right,
let's get started.

185
00:12:49,744 --> 00:12:51,378
Archie:
Oh, before I forget,

186
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,080
you don't know
a Paul Bowman, do you?

187
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:54,848
Never heard of him.

188
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:56,783
Well, I met him earlier.

189
00:12:56,784 --> 00:12:59,520
And we just passed him
in the Land Rover.

190
00:12:59,521 --> 00:13:01,688
Where is
the Land Rover?

191
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:05,492
It's a wee bit stuck.

192
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,328
Duncan,
if you were a stag,

193
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,697
<i>we'd have you
culled by now.</i>

194
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:13,500
- Bowman, you said?
- Yeah.

195
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,936
No, never heard of him.

196
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:19,473
Have I got it all?

197
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:22,276
Yeah, yeah.
Look as good as new.

198
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:23,843
( laughing )

199
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,780
You know, I always remember
the first time we came here.

200
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:30,016
Zara and Archie
racing through here,

201
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,919
her in her best frock
and him in his short trousers.

202
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,021
- Mother-
- what was it you used to play?

203
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,023
"Kiss, chase. "

204
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,759
Oh, aye,
did he ever catch you?

205
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,728
He was the one
running away.

206
00:13:41,729 --> 00:13:43,897
( chuckling )

207
00:13:43,898 --> 00:13:45,932
There we are.

208
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:47,901
My late husband
Gerald and I,

209
00:13:47,902 --> 00:13:51,572
we always hoped that Zara
and Archie might have...

210
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:53,440
<i>never mind.</i>

211
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:54,941
How is your husband?

212
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:58,112
Still running. But he lets
me catch him sometimes.

213
00:13:58,113 --> 00:13:59,446
( chuckles )

214
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:01,948
Zara, bless her,
has given up chasing.

215
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:03,183
Haven't you, poppet?

216
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,254
Sorry about
the early arrival.

217
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:09,423
It's fine.
Isn't it, Lexie?

218
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:11,225
Absolutely.

219
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,227
Zara may have given up
on the manhunt,

220
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,962
but I thought if I was finally
going to find a new husband,

221
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:19,166
I should get along early
to avoid disappointment.

222
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:23,570
We're not in your way,
are we?

223
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,440
No, not at all.

224
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:28,675
I know from all the functions
I've arranged

225
00:14:28,676 --> 00:14:30,310
it's when you think
it's all in hand,

226
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:32,979
that's when the little problems
seem to pop up out of nowhere.

227
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,748
Don't they just.

228
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,151
( sighs )

229
00:14:37,152 --> 00:14:40,420
We do so always love
coming to visit Glenbogle.

230
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,590
And we love having you. You
mustn't leave it so long next time.

231
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,726
I can see Archie's done well
for himself with you, Lexie.

232
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:49,696
Perhaps you should have
a word with Zara later.

233
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:51,632
Pass on your
secret for success.

234
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:53,500
Well, then it wouldn't
be a secret anymore.

235
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:56,637
And now, if you'll excuse me
I've got flowers to sort out,

236
00:14:56,638 --> 00:14:59,206
wine to move
and a kitchen to de-haggis.

237
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:04,478
( sighs ) One can
never have too much time

238
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:06,446
to get ready
for these occasions.

239
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,382
Clearly not.

240
00:15:08,383 --> 00:15:10,784
And as you can see, Molly,
Zara is not blessed

241
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,819
with Lexie's
natural beauty.

242
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,988
Look, if a girl is going
to catch the right chap

243
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:17,658
she's got to have
the right face to do it with.

244
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,660
<i>And if you haven't
got one of your own,</i>

245
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:21,328
<i>paint it on.</i>

246
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:25,432
Well, I think that Zara has
a very nice natural look.

247
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:27,267
<i>- Help!
- Help!</i>

248
00:15:27,268 --> 00:15:29,269
Can I hear
someone calling?

249
00:15:37,412 --> 00:15:38,912
Just the wind.

250
00:15:38,913 --> 00:15:40,581
( chuckles )

251
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:46,886
Help! Help!

252
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:53,893
Maybe bouncing around
isn't such a good idea.

253
00:15:53,894 --> 00:15:56,630
But somebody's bound to cross
the landing sooner or later

254
00:15:56,631 --> 00:15:58,498
then they'll hear.

255
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:02,769
Or maybe they'll see you when you
come crashing through the ceiling.

256
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,905
- What exactly are you implying?
- Nothing.

257
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:07,173
I may be a little stout,

258
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,376
but it think it's a bit off
to point it out.

259
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:11,211
That's not
what I meant.

260
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:14,180
Nanny always said I was built
for carrying responsibilities.

261
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,149
Nanny?

262
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,353
Ow.

263
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,223
And just for the record,

264
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:25,592
I am only
a few pounds heavier

265
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:27,461
than the official
national average

266
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:29,563
for my height
and build.

267
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:32,366
I just happen to be
three inches shorter.

268
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:36,370
We have guests

269
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:39,105
and some assistance
would be appreciated.

270
00:16:39,106 --> 00:16:41,508
Ah, that box there
I wanted.

271
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:45,312
Oh, and I thought-
wait! Ahh!

272
00:16:45,313 --> 00:16:48,382
I do hope that isn't
too painful.

273
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,324
Worse things
in the world

274
00:16:57,325 --> 00:17:00,027
than being guardian
to all this, wouldn't you say?

275
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:03,596
I can't believe I ever thought
I could live away from here.

276
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:05,698
<i>Golly:
Sometimes in our lives</i>

277
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,235
<i>we're after
different things, son.</i>

278
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:14,041
Archie: Remind me never to take
all this for granted, Golly.

279
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:20,947
Caring, gentle,
understanding-

280
00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:23,917
- You could have been a nurse, couldn't you?
- Me? I doubt it.

281
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,753
You have all the qualities.
( gasps )

282
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,721
Sorry.

283
00:17:28,722 --> 00:17:30,623
Didn't feel a thing.

284
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:32,725
Molly,

285
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:35,495
I've got
a jolly large splinter.

286
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:38,398
- Where?
- Just there. It's huge.

287
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:40,400
Oh, Kilwillie,
don't be such a baby.

288
00:17:42,503 --> 00:17:44,771
- It broken?
- Just bruised.

289
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,573
Oh, well,
never mind.

290
00:17:46,574 --> 00:17:48,975
Would you like me to take
a look at your splinter?

291
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,984
Okay, son,

292
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,020
a good clean shot
to the heart.

293
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,725
- ( grunts )
- ( gunshot fires )

294
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:40,860
What are you doing?
I had the perfect shot.

295
00:18:55,543 --> 00:18:57,744
I'm told you're
looking for me.

296
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,186
If you're the man
in this photo, then yes.

297
00:19:07,821 --> 00:19:09,722
<i>- Megan.
- My mother.</i>

298
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,796
- Duncan.
- Aye?

299
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:19,166
Go and see if you
can drive Big Eric

300
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,867
up to the point
in the hill there.

301
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,070
<i>In 10 minutes we'll
cross the trees</i>

302
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:26,072
<i>and see if we can
get a clear shot.</i>

303
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:29,643
<i>You'll be upwind
of him there.</i>

304
00:19:29,644 --> 00:19:30,943
Just do it, Duncan.

305
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:51,030
I knew there was a chance you
would come up here someday,

306
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:53,132
but not this way.

307
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,536
I found this
in mom's things.

308
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:02,242
Three weeks ago, I came home
from leave to find her dying...

309
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,944
alone in her flat.

310
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:06,946
I'm truly sorry
to hear that.

311
00:20:08,482 --> 00:20:10,750
It's from
your solicitors.

312
00:20:12,152 --> 00:20:16,155
Read it.

313
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:31,738
"We acknowledge your desire
to keep independence

314
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:35,342
<i>and sole responsibility
for the child.</i>

315
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:39,346
The Glenbogle estate, representing
the interests of the father. "

316
00:20:44,685 --> 00:20:46,620
He's your son.

317
00:20:48,055 --> 00:20:50,724
<i>My mother didn't want
anything from you back then</i>

318
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:52,659
<i>and neither do I.</i>

319
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,863
- It's not that simple.
- All I came here for was to see my father.

320
00:20:56,864 --> 00:20:59,466
See the man who walked into my
mother's life 30-odd years ago

321
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,434
<i>and left her with a son.</i>

322
00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:05,805
- I said it's not that simple.
- Then tell me you're not my father.

323
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,541
Tell me that and I'll
leave here and not come back.

324
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,084
We've got a stag
to shoot.

325
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:20,153
Golly, you have
to deal with this.

326
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:23,823
There's a storm
away in the mountains.

327
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,025
I want us finished
and off the hill

328
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:27,994
before it decides
to blow.

329
00:21:40,408 --> 00:21:42,309
Thank you.

330
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,311
There you go.

331
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:47,013
- Here we are.
- Ohh...

332
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,582
- Help yourselves.
- Oh, that's splendid.

333
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,518
<i>An army marches
on its stomach.</i>

334
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,753
You shouldn't have
gone to all this trouble.

335
00:21:53,754 --> 00:21:55,488
You have enough
to do as it is.

336
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,425
I feel dreadful
about the haggis.

337
00:21:58,426 --> 00:22:01,361
- The best thing you can do is take care of our guests.
- Roger.

338
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:03,530
Making the haggis is
the last thing I needed.

339
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:06,199
Don't know when I'm going to
have time to decorate this hall.

340
00:22:07,802 --> 00:22:10,570
I knew I was right
to get here early.

341
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:13,172
Please, tell me
he's single.

342
00:22:13,173 --> 00:22:15,208
- I'm not sure.
- You must know.

343
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,510
Widowed, I think.

344
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,682
Now he would fit rather
nicely alongside my fireside.

345
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:25,218
I shouldn't set your cap
at just the one chap

346
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,420
until you've seen all
the available candidates.

347
00:22:27,421 --> 00:22:29,756
Yes, I'm sure
you're right, dear.

348
00:22:32,493 --> 00:22:35,161
You seem to have
forgotten my lemon.

349
00:22:35,162 --> 00:22:36,730
Oh, I'm sorry.

350
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,565
I'll forgive you...

351
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,533
just this once.

352
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,816
The last ball we gave
had a Damien Hirst theme.

353
00:22:56,817 --> 00:22:58,951
It looked
absolutely fabulous.

354
00:22:58,952 --> 00:23:01,521
Oh.
I'm sure it did.

355
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:03,923
You've got quite a gift
for interior design.

356
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,892
Oh, thank you, Molly.

357
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:07,660
I meant Zara.

358
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:09,662
One doesn't like
to blow one's own trumpet.

359
00:23:09,663 --> 00:23:12,632
If I didn't blow mine
nobody else would.

360
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,438
( Kilwillie
and Molly chuckle )

361
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,874
Would you come
into the hall for a moment?

362
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,876
I've had an idea.
Excuse us, Kilwillie.

363
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:44,096
I know things have
to be dealt with,

364
00:23:44,097 --> 00:23:46,833
but not up here.
Not like this.

365
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:50,069
Why are you so scared
of admitting the truth?

366
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,505
I'm not planning on
claiming the family jewels.

367
00:23:57,545 --> 00:23:59,278
Talk to me.

368
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:08,655
Now I got the answer
I came for.

369
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,925
- Golly, you can't just let him go like this.
- Get out of my way!

370
00:24:11,926 --> 00:24:16,128
- No.
- I've never had a father and I don't want one.

371
00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:19,599
- Not one like him, that's for sure.
- I'm not your father, Paul.

372
00:24:22,202 --> 00:24:24,403
Hector MacDonald was.

373
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:28,474
You and Archie
are brothers.

374
00:24:33,881 --> 00:24:37,617
( Kilwillie wheezes )

375
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:40,119
Kilwillie, could you go down
to the cellar for me please

376
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,822
<i>and see if you can find
something special for the toasts?</i>

377
00:24:42,823 --> 00:24:45,091
Of course.

378
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:46,559
<i>Andrew:
Warm work, that.</i>

379
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,228
If you get too hot, you could
always take your shirt off.

380
00:24:50,598 --> 00:24:52,799
I think perhaps
he needs a hand.

381
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,767
These bottles
can be heavy.

382
00:24:59,073 --> 00:25:00,974
( laughs )

383
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:03,375
You do realize that the
hunting season finishes today.

384
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,478
Oh, don't worry, dear.

385
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:09,448
I plan to have my stag stuffed
and mounted by midnight.

386
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:18,024
As far as Hector
was concerned,

387
00:25:18,025 --> 00:25:20,059
Molly had left him.

388
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,061
<i>Poor woman felt
trapped up here.</i>

389
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,998
No friends, nothing.
Different world.

390
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:27,734
She felt she had to get away-
she went back to London.

391
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:30,269
Hector had no idea if she
would ever be coming back.

392
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,338
Oh, so he ran off
to my mother?

393
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:34,674
<i>Look...</i>

394
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:37,209
I'm not trying to excuse
Hector's actions.

395
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,878
No more did he.

396
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:40,880
He lived with the shame
of it all his days,

397
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:44,250
<i>but the man was shattered.
Molly had left.</i>

398
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,552
<i>He disappeared.</i>

399
00:25:47,554 --> 00:25:49,689
I tracked him down
to Edinburgh.

400
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,091
That's where that photo
was taken.

401
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,060
Anyway,
by the time

402
00:25:54,061 --> 00:25:56,228
he got back here
it was all over between them.

403
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:59,766
<i>And then... Megan discovered
she was pregnant.</i>

404
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,668
<i>He wanted to do
the right thing by her,</i>

405
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:04,871
<i>wanted to make sure that
she wanted for nothing, but...</i>

406
00:26:04,872 --> 00:26:06,939
she found out
that he was married,

407
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,176
she- she didn't want
to know him anymore.

408
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,714
<i>I was sworn to secrecy.</i>

409
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:19,451
The family solicitors
drew a line under the matter

410
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:22,288
<i>with that letter.</i>

411
00:26:23,323 --> 00:26:25,024
I don't believe this.

412
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:28,094
Hector made me swear,
Archie.

413
00:26:28,095 --> 00:26:30,529
My father owned
all this?

414
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,399
So everything I've ever known
is a lie, is it?

415
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,868
You are still
Hector's son.

416
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:37,870
And so is he.

417
00:26:37,871 --> 00:26:39,872
If I hadn't come here,

418
00:26:39,873 --> 00:26:41,774
no one would
ever have told me.

419
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:44,744
That was the way
your mother wanted it to be.

420
00:26:47,014 --> 00:26:48,948
( panting )

421
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:51,617
What are you doing?

422
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:54,520
I got him around to exactly
where you wanted him.

423
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:57,323
You had the perfect shot.
Why didn't you take it?

424
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:04,130
I came up here
to shoot Big Eric

425
00:27:04,131 --> 00:27:06,032
and that's
what I'm going to do.

426
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:08,201
Archie.

427
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,804
Does somebody want
to tell me what's going on?

428
00:27:11,805 --> 00:27:13,806
Not now, Duncan.

429
00:27:23,717 --> 00:27:26,619
I can't believe the girls from
the pub aren't even here yet.

430
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,521
<i>( hammering )</i>

431
00:27:30,758 --> 00:27:32,925
<i>- Lexie: What have you done?
- Oriental chic.</i>

432
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:39,599
This is my hallway.

433
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,501
Molly asked
if I could help.

434
00:27:41,502 --> 00:27:44,470
<i>Molly: You said you didn't
have time to decorate the hall.</i>

435
00:27:44,471 --> 00:27:47,540
<i>- so I asked Zara to do it.
- This is very now, I can assure you.</i>

436
00:27:50,076 --> 00:27:53,879
When the guests arrive, this
will be the first thing they see?

437
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,214
Mm-hmm.

438
00:27:57,685 --> 00:28:00,520
This isn't Glenbogle.

439
00:28:00,521 --> 00:28:02,522
This isn't me.

440
00:28:05,426 --> 00:28:08,328
I suppose we could
lose some of the candles.

441
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,566
Lexie.

442
00:28:23,276 --> 00:28:25,911
We should try and drive him
across the glen.

443
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,481
Keep ourselves
well below the skyline.

444
00:28:28,482 --> 00:28:31,317
Nah, he's heading
for cover.

445
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:33,519
He'll not leave
the herd.

446
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,755
He's hurt.

447
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,190
He wants cover.

448
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:40,693
I think Duncan's right.

449
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,100
( bellows )

450
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,803
If he makes it through those
trees, you'll not get a shot.

451
00:28:50,804 --> 00:28:53,573
Nah.

452
00:28:53,574 --> 00:28:56,876
We've been keeping him
moving all day. He's tired.

453
00:28:56,877 --> 00:29:00,045
We should let him
make it to the trees.

454
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:02,715
Then we can take
the shot on our terms.

455
00:29:08,522 --> 00:29:10,556
Okay.

456
00:29:10,557 --> 00:29:12,558
Let's do it.

457
00:29:23,103 --> 00:29:25,104
Can I talk to you?

458
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,441
We're losing light.

459
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:38,518
( sighs )
Oh dear, no.

460
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:40,787
Far too demure.

461
00:29:40,788 --> 00:29:43,322
- Oh.
- ( laughs )

462
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,625
Oh, he's obviously seen
a thing or two.

463
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:48,027
But I like
worldly men.

464
00:29:48,028 --> 00:29:51,196
I'm surprised you've not
taken a shine to him, Molly.

465
00:29:51,197 --> 00:29:53,999
- Me?
- Now that you're a free agent

466
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,135
it must have
crossed your mind.

467
00:29:56,136 --> 00:29:58,270
Go on, admit it.

468
00:29:58,271 --> 00:30:00,440
No.
Well, I mean-

469
00:30:00,441 --> 00:30:03,108
just don't go trying
anything this evening.

470
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:04,677
I've got first dibs.

471
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,650
Ah-ha,
the black.

472
00:30:10,651 --> 00:30:13,653
The black, the black,
the black...

473
00:30:14,655 --> 00:30:17,457
( growls )

474
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:20,760
No, the booking
was for today,

475
00:30:20,761 --> 00:30:23,128
not for next week.

476
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:25,565
But, Dougal,
I've got over 100 guests.

477
00:30:25,566 --> 00:30:27,333
<i>I need those girls.</i>

478
00:30:28,902 --> 00:30:30,670
A wedding.

479
00:30:30,671 --> 00:30:32,872
Oh, right. Well, you're
sorry and I'm stuffed.

480
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:36,308
Oh, Lexie.

481
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:38,344
( sighs )

482
00:31:03,837 --> 00:31:06,038
I remember my first stag.

483
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,009
I was 13.

484
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:13,278
I didn't want
to come.

485
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:18,217
There was no way my father
was going to have a son

486
00:31:18,218 --> 00:31:20,252
<i>who couldn't stalk.</i>

487
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,859
I was never supposed to be
the oldest son.

488
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:31,196
<i>This isn't my place.</i>

489
00:31:35,368 --> 00:31:37,503
Jamie should be here,
not me.

490
00:32:00,393 --> 00:32:02,428
Someone has unplugged it.

491
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:05,397
I can't risk serving food to guests
that's been lying around unchilled.

492
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:06,933
Where was it plugged in?

493
00:32:06,934 --> 00:32:09,001
In the kitchen.

494
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:12,905
- By the food mixer?
- Yes.

495
00:32:12,906 --> 00:32:15,675
W- w-w-well, I'm sure
it will be all right.

496
00:32:15,676 --> 00:32:17,743
Okay,
there you go.

497
00:32:17,744 --> 00:32:20,512
Just don't come blaming me
when the salmonella kicks in.

498
00:32:25,385 --> 00:32:28,253
No chance of a snack,
is there, to keep us going?

499
00:32:28,254 --> 00:32:30,556
<i>( tray thuds )</i>

500
00:32:33,527 --> 00:32:36,028
( bellows )

501
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:38,231
Okay, just breathe in,
hold it,

502
00:32:38,232 --> 00:32:40,899
and let it out slowly
when you squeeze the trigger.

503
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,157
Archie.

504
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:27,647
Okay, son,
take the shot.

505
00:33:34,655 --> 00:33:36,622
<i>( gunshot )</i>

506
00:33:38,592 --> 00:33:40,826
Clean shot.

507
00:33:41,828 --> 00:33:43,829
Perfect shot.

508
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:47,700
I'll go and get
the pony from the shelter.

509
00:34:09,523 --> 00:34:12,157
We may share a father...

510
00:34:14,528 --> 00:34:17,229
but I only have
one brother...

511
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,532
and he died
16 years ago.

512
00:34:31,578 --> 00:34:33,579
Lexie?

513
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,592
Okay, okay,
you were right.

514
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:48,794
I took on too much.

515
00:34:50,997 --> 00:34:53,332
Lexie, darling,

516
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,501
this evening isn't
about the food we eat

517
00:34:55,502 --> 00:34:58,904
or the decor.
It's about you and Glenbogle

518
00:34:58,905 --> 00:35:00,906
and saying thank you
to everybody

519
00:35:00,907 --> 00:35:02,775
for a wonderful season.

520
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,846
I just wanted it to be
as good as it always is.

521
00:35:09,683 --> 00:35:11,951
Well, things don't always
have to be the same

522
00:35:11,952 --> 00:35:13,986
to be good, do they?

523
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,655
No, I suppose not.

524
00:35:19,526 --> 00:35:21,894
Well...

525
00:35:21,895 --> 00:35:24,196
maybe it's time
for something a bit more...

526
00:35:24,197 --> 00:35:26,164
Lexie MacDonald.

527
00:35:31,437 --> 00:35:33,205
Shall I gather
the troops?

528
00:35:33,206 --> 00:35:36,174
This is going to be one Ghillie's
Ball Glenbogle will not forget.

529
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:39,912
Okay, Kilwillie, could you clear
the front of the house please

530
00:35:39,913 --> 00:35:41,947
of any vehicles
that are there?

531
00:35:41,948 --> 00:35:45,417
Andrew, could you set up some
car parking spaces in the field?

532
00:35:45,418 --> 00:35:47,853
- Mm-hmm.
- I- I could help him.

533
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,322
But hadn't he better
go with someone

534
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:52,858
who knows the layout
of the estate?

535
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,828
Okay, yup, well,

536
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:58,864
Marilyn and Zara, could you
both come with me please?

537
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:10,509
Keeping an eye
on me?

538
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:24,389
Duncan: Eric ended up in the
woods after all, eh, Golly?

539
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,258
Golly:
Yeah, well done, son.

540
00:36:26,259 --> 00:36:28,260
You were right
and I was wrong.

541
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:31,163
But if you tell anyone,
I'll just deny it.

542
00:36:31,164 --> 00:36:33,465
Duncan: ( laughs ) So does this mean

543
00:36:33,466 --> 00:36:35,467
you're going to tell me
what's going on?

544
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:37,903
Golly: You'll find out soon enough.

545
00:36:59,292 --> 00:37:01,760
I don't want my mother
knowing about this.

546
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,598
I don't think it's something you're
going to be able to keep from her.

547
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,800
You kept it
from me for long enough.

548
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:09,768
And that was wrong.

549
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,937
Look how hurt
you've been by it.

550
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,339
It was wrong,
Archie.

551
00:37:15,475 --> 00:37:18,110
I want him
away from Glenbogle.

552
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:20,646
It's late, son.
He's nowhere to go.

553
00:37:23,316 --> 00:37:25,484
The least you can do
is sleep on it.

554
00:37:30,857 --> 00:37:32,791
<i>( siren wails )</i>

555
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:49,975
Listen, Archie,

556
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,144
let the women
have their night.

557
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,513
No need to rush in
and ruin it.

558
00:38:04,924 --> 00:38:08,127
- What do you think?
- You are so clever.

559
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,795
I should have
thought of it.

560
00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:29,148
I want your word that you
won't cause any trouble.

561
00:38:29,149 --> 00:38:30,683
Lexie: Hi!

562
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:33,518
( laughs ) While you've
been out having fun all day,

563
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,520
we have been
working very hard.

564
00:38:38,825 --> 00:38:41,026
- Yeah, Paul.
- Lexie.

565
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,028
I see you got Golly.

566
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,097
So are you going to come
and join us, Paul?

567
00:38:45,098 --> 00:38:47,933
- I don't think so.
- No arguments.

568
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:49,301
I'd better be off.

569
00:38:49,302 --> 00:38:51,636
Lexie!

570
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,008
Archie, tell Paul he's got
to come and join in the fun.

571
00:38:56,009 --> 00:38:58,944
You know it's compulsory
at a Lexie MacDonald event.

572
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:02,047
And I have my ghillie
for the ball.

573
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,750
You know, this day just keeps
getting better and better.

574
00:39:07,787 --> 00:39:09,855
So that's your wife?

575
00:39:12,025 --> 00:39:14,727
Listen, I just wanted to find my father.

576
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:16,661
But I'm too late.

577
00:39:18,297 --> 00:39:21,967
- So- - you won't find
a room in the village.

578
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:24,402
You can stay here.

579
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,007
Thanks.

580
00:39:29,008 --> 00:39:31,443
Just for tonight.

Oh, there's one.

585
00:39:48,494 --> 00:39:50,996
- Sorry.
- Lovely.

586
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:55,267
I'm in pole position!

587
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,602
I'll take that one.
That one here. thank you.

588
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,739
This is the highlands, not
some English seaside resort.

589
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,275
Oh, Zara,
come and have some fun.

590

Oh no,
it's ruined.

Thank you.

601
00:41:09,943 --> 00:41:12,444
Come on, Kilwillie. I need
some help with the catering.

602
00:41:12,445 --> 00:41:14,079
Catering?

603
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,915
17 fried rice,
18 beef and oyster sauce,

604
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,550
<i>19 sweet and sour prawn.</i>

605
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:20,486
Eh, 20 sweet and sour prawn.

606
00:41:20,487 --> 00:41:22,688
20 sweet and sour prawn
and 16 chicken chop suey.

607
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,623
<i>- is there anything else?
- Prawn crackers?</i>

608
00:41:24,624 --> 00:41:26,592
You didn't order any.

609
00:41:26,593 --> 00:41:30,295
Well, I though we might get
some complimentary ones.

610

Ladies and gentlemen,

615
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,614
dinner is served.

616
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:50,949
( cheering )

617
00:41:54,854 --> 00:41:57,923
And of course, this would not
be the Glenbogle Ghillie's Ball

618
00:41:57,924 --> 00:42:00,926
without...
the monster haggis.

619
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:11,102
Okay everyone,
tuck in.

620
00:42:11,103 --> 00:42:12,170
Help yourselves.

621
00:42:19,278 --> 00:42:21,112
I suppose now you're
going to tell me

622
00:42:21,113 --> 00:42:23,248
that you don't like
chicken chow mein and haggis?

623
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,652
It's fine, though given
the choice, I'd prefer Japanese.

624
00:42:26,653 --> 00:42:29,354
I want you just to have
a good time, Zara.

625
00:42:29,355 --> 00:42:30,989
That's what I want
for everyone.

626
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,925
Seems I've fulfilled
mother's prophecy

627
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:34,793
and ended up on
the shelf yet again.

628
00:42:34,794 --> 00:42:36,795
Why don't you come
and meet some people?

629
00:42:36,796 --> 00:42:38,864
Like this?

630
00:42:39,866 --> 00:42:42,367
Oh dear.
We'll try something new.

631
00:42:44,571 --> 00:42:46,805
Come with me.

632
00:42:46,806 --> 00:42:49,374
So Archie was a bit
of a heartbreaker

633
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:51,176
at age eight,
was he?

634
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:55,146
I rather like the way
you do things at Glenbogle.

635
00:42:55,147 --> 00:42:57,049
Lexie's done
a wonderful job.

636
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,817
In fact,
I've got to like

637
00:42:58,818 --> 00:43:00,953
a lot of things
since I've been here.

638
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:02,921
Shall we?

No.

like that?

You look great.

646
00:44:00,212 --> 00:44:02,648
Now, let's get
you a drink.

647
00:44:04,316 --> 00:44:06,451
Here we are.

648
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:15,560
Can't we have
some music for dancing?

649
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:17,595
I forgot the band.

650
00:44:17,596 --> 00:44:20,766
Well, I'm a bit rusty but I could
give you a quick burst on these.

651
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:23,601
Why not? You can do everything else.

652
00:44:23,602 --> 00:44:26,171
If I dare say so,

653
00:44:26,172 --> 00:44:28,573
I have had a bit
of an idea on that front.

00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:38,817

Doesn't she
look beautiful?

657
00:44:55,168 --> 00:44:57,169

It's fine, it's fine.
No, no, don't worry.

You know they're
out there...

674

they're gonna let rip.

Well, I hope it holds off
until I get home.
