1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,368
Can you see me okay?

2
00:00:05,369 --> 00:00:08,504
Perfectly. You've got a wee
spot on the end of your nose.

3
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:10,206
Thank you very much.
Charming.

4
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:11,774
What about the tilt?
Is that working?

5
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:13,075
<i>Hold on.</i>

6
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:14,877
Yep. Good.
Microphone.

7
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:18,214
- Testing... one, two, two.
- I'm hearing you, loud and clear.

8
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:19,848
Good. You'd better check
the other cameras.

9
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:23,186
Golly, are you there?

10
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:25,120
<i>- Yes.
- is Lexie there?</i>

11
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:26,556
This better not
take all day.

12
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:28,757
I've got dinner for 12
to make.

13
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:31,126
<i>- Lexie?
- Duncan?</i>

14
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,597
- Duncan?
- Duncan?

15
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:37,333
Molly, I know I can
rely on you.

16
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:39,435
Oh, hello dear.

17
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:42,572
I'm in go mode
in the library. Beep.

18
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:44,674
Is father there?

19
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:47,042
No, don't worry, he'll
be here in a minute.

20
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:49,945
Good. What about Duncan?
Has anyone seen him?

21
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:52,348
- He promised- Duncan!
- Duncan?!

22
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:55,585
<i>- Duncan! - tell him we're going to
be online in a minute.</i>

23
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:56,952
<i>- get over here, boy!
- Duncan...</i>

24
00:00:56,953 --> 00:00:59,054
<i>hang on,
I think I've got him.</i>

25
00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:00,923
<i>( all yelling at Duncan )</i>

26
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:03,526
<i>Duncan!</i>

27
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:06,995
Ready?

28
00:01:06,996 --> 00:01:08,864
Right.
Good luck, Archie.

29
00:01:08,865 --> 00:01:10,099
Thank you.

30
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,534
<i>Lexie: Look, look
- come on.</i>

31
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:12,535
Ten... nine...

32
00:01:12,536 --> 00:01:13,703
Golly, the wheelbarrow!

33
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:15,738
<i>- Yes, right, okay.
- seven... six...</i>

34
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,306
five... Duncan!

35
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:20,343
- Three... two...
- ( everyone jabbering )

36
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:22,411
<i>One!</i>

37
00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:24,179
The highlands of Scotland,

38
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,848
a beautiful
and magical place.

39
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:28,517
<i>And here by the shores
of the distant loch,</i>

40
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:30,519
<i>stands an ancient
family home.</i>

41
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,622
<i>Welcome to Glenbogle.</i>

42
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:33,822
<i>Deep in the heart
of Caledonia,</i>

43
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:36,992
now going online
to the world,

44
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:38,561
my name is
Archie MacDonald,

45
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:40,329
<i>I am the laird here.</i>

46
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,765
<i>- for 400 years and more,
my family have lived... - Molly!</i>

47
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:47,136
<i>- ... in this fantastic place.
- What am I supposed to do? It's embarrassing!</i>

48
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:49,972
Lean against the mantelpiece
and look aristocratic.

49
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:51,140
Ugh!

50
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,345
Go.

51
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:57,913
<i>Go!</i>

52
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:00,650
Hector: What about my lunch?

53
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:02,451
Molly: You've just had breakfast.

54
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:03,819
What am I supposed to do now?

55
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,954
Look at the camera,
and smile.

56
00:02:08,358 --> 00:02:09,925
<i>Ronald! Holly!
Dogs sit!</i>

57
00:02:09,926 --> 00:02:11,694
Sit!

58
00:02:11,695 --> 00:02:13,862
<i>Hector: Down, sir, down. Wee bit, down.</i>

59
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:18,066
<i>Lexie: Come on, Arch...
nearly on, come on!</i>

60
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:22,070
<i>Go.</i>

61
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:24,607
Now, a new day dawns
at Glenbogle.

62
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:27,810
After centuries as a tranquil
retreat for one family,

63
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:29,679
we're throwing it open
so that others can-

64
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,247
<i>enjoy it too.</i>

65
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:35,050

Yes!

72
00:02:49,032 --> 00:02:51,400
Well, how was it?

73
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:53,836
Archie, it was great!

74
00:02:54,904 --> 00:02:56,806
<i>You should be

75
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:58,574
Thank you very much.

76
00:02:58,575 --> 00:03:00,309
Justine,
you missed it!

77
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,878
Sorry, I was-
just running our business.

78
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,947
<i>But I see you're
in good hands.</i>

79
00:03:04,948 --> 00:03:06,816
Literally.

80
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:08,417
( sneezes )

81
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:09,918
Bless you.

82
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:15,023
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

83
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,161
These came
for you.

84
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:28,063
Thanks.

85
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,834
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:33,936
It's not really me
you should apologise to.

87
00:04:33,937 --> 00:04:36,872
I'd never have got this whole
thing running without Katrina.

88
00:04:36,873 --> 00:04:40,309
I.T. training, business degree
and golden curls.

89
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,578
Look, just because we
were at school together,

90
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:43,979
and we happen to have
quite a lot in common-

91
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,214
and she's always here,
and you like each other.

92
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:48,617
That doesn't mean she's
a threat to you, sweetheart.

93
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:49,852
Doesn't it?

94
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:52,220
Can't you just try
to get on with her?

95
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,956
She could be
a real help to us.

96
00:04:55,692 --> 00:04:57,125
Okay.

97
00:04:57,126 --> 00:04:59,027
For you.

98
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:05,167
<i>Archie: Oh, look
- someone's dropped in for tea.</i>

99
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:07,202
That's not someone-

100
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:09,237
<i>that's Mr. Brown.</i>

101
00:05:09,238 --> 00:05:11,774
<i>International man
of mystery.</i>

102
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:16,879
<i>( plane approaching )</i>

103
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:26,188
Welcome to Glenbogle,
Mr. Brown.

104
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:29,191
I do hope you have
a successful course.

105
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:30,726
What could possibly
go wrong?

106
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:32,227
<i>Hector:
Good day to you.</i>

107
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:34,396
I knew our home was being
invaded by aliens,

108
00:05:34,397 --> 00:05:36,064
but isn't this a touch
over the top?

109
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:38,200
Watch out!

110
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:41,036
<i>What's that?</i>

111
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:42,638
Gear.

112
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,707
Gear?

113
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,308
This is
Hector MacDonald,

114
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:48,110
my partner's
father.

115
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:49,545
And this is
Mr. Brown,

116
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:51,814
who is organising the
management training weekend.

117
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:53,516
How monumentally
uninteresting.

118
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:54,950
Tell me,
are you as dull

119
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:57,119
<i>as your name and
occupation suggest?</i>

120
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,721
- Hector?
- Huh?

121
00:05:58,722 --> 00:06:01,957
We're having your people
picked up per your instructions.

122
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,527
This equipment needs
to be stowed in my office.

123
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:06,428
Office?!

124
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:11,433
<i>Man: You'll love working
at the old bank, Mary.</i>

125
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:13,235
<i>They really look out
for their employees.</i>

126
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:16,505
- Really? - Yes, treat you with
courtesy and consideration.

127
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:19,408
Not like those hard-nosed
so-and-so's you used to be with.

128
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:21,076
I'm a bit
frightened though-

129
00:06:21,077 --> 00:06:23,145
a team building exercise
in my first week.

130
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:24,880
There's nothing to it.

131
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:27,683
- A few day's r & r away from base.
- ( sheep passes gas )

132
00:06:27,684 --> 00:06:29,585
And you'll love it here.

133
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:31,587
There it is, children.

134
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:34,356
<i>Prepare to enter
the kingdom of heaven.</i>

135
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:37,526
A haven of peace
and harmony.

136
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:40,663
Looks a total dump,
if you ask me.

137
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:52,007
( beeping )

138
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:58,080
( sheep bleats )

139
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:00,616
Man 2: I turned down a corporate box

140
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:02,985
at the open
for this?

141
00:07:02,986 --> 00:07:06,455
Two miles down the track
in an army truck...

142
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:08,523
<i>and a dose
of mad cow disease.</i>

143
00:07:08,524 --> 00:07:10,826
( chatting )

144
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:12,928
Mary:
This is beautiful!

145
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:16,298
You see, the thing is, Katrina,

146
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:18,500
Archie and I have been
together for a long time,

147
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:20,102
and that's not
going to change,

148
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:22,571
especially now that I've
committed myself to Glenbogle.

149
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:24,873
So... it's a waste
of your time,

150
00:07:24,874 --> 00:07:27,175
energy, and frankly,
your dignity,

151
00:07:27,176 --> 00:07:28,911
trying to
prise him away.

152
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:30,846
I am doing
no such thing.

153
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:32,347
Come off it.

154
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:34,349
You're never away
from the place.

155
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,284
Glenbogle is my home,

156
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:39,521
and has been for far longer
than it's been yours.

157
00:07:39,522 --> 00:07:40,789
Correction-
your home is

158
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,825
20 minutes cycle ride down the glen.

159
00:07:42,826 --> 00:07:44,459
Maybe you should
stay there.

160
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,294
Aye, maybe I will.

161
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:47,863
This conversation
is demeaning,

162
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:49,531
especially for you,
Justine.

163
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:51,166
As long as you get
the message.

164
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,735
Perhaps I should
express it

165
00:07:52,736 --> 00:07:54,837
in the language
of the highland laird,

166
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:56,438
private property.

167
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,840
Keep off.

168
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:13,321
Are you piping this piston, or not?

169
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:15,090
Justine said
not to bother

170
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:17,693
<i>- with that sturmarche anymore.
- Oh, she did, did she?</i>

171
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:21,163
Well, why don't we all
stop wearing kilts,

172
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:23,365
<i>eating deep fried mars bars,
and hating the english?</i>

173
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:25,367
<i>And all our other ancient
Scottish traditions?</i>

174
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:27,369
<i>Golly:
Who rattled your cage?</i>

175
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,905
Anyways, since when
have you been so in love

176
00:08:29,906 --> 00:08:31,606
with the scuttle
of the pipes?

177
00:08:31,607 --> 00:08:33,542
Maybe when Glenbogle's
answer to Mrs. Thatcher

178
00:08:33,543 --> 00:08:35,911
<i>started
banning them.</i>

179
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:38,914
<i>- Golly: it's okay.
- Duncan: yeah, fair play.</i>

180
00:08:38,915 --> 00:08:40,049
She's okay.

181
00:08:42,018 --> 00:08:44,452
Well... -ish.

182
00:08:44,453 --> 00:08:46,354
<i>Answer me this,
then-</i>

183
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:48,891
is it as much fun as
when it was just Archie?

184
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:51,393
Lexie, the bankers have arrived
so we'll eat at 7:00.

185
00:08:51,394 --> 00:08:53,862
Promptly, this time,
if you don't mind.

186
00:08:53,863 --> 00:08:56,364
What is it?
Venison?

187
00:08:56,365 --> 00:08:57,399
Cow.

188
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,701
( snickering )

189
00:09:01,071 --> 00:09:03,538
Well, maybe this time

190
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:05,808
<i>you can manage
not to overcook it.</i>

191
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:09,544
Last time we had beef, it was stringy,
tough, and - rather tasteless.

192
00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:11,580
Maybe it's not the only thing,
round here, eh?

193
00:09:18,922 --> 00:09:20,355
( sighs )

194
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:22,591
<i>Man 2:
Come on! In my room,</i>

195
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:24,960
<i>there's a trouser press,
a coffee percolator,</i>

196
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:27,262
<i>sundry other electricals,</i>

197
00:09:27,263 --> 00:09:30,498
and then- and I don't know who's
train of thought we're on here-

198
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:33,301
I come across
this little beauty.

199
00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:36,504
I mean, mints?
On the pillows?

200
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:40,408
This is not up-and-at-'em
team building, Fleming.

201
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:43,712
This is the generation game
in a gingham skirt.

202
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:46,615
Nigel, you're like a blind man
in paradise. It's wonderful here.

203
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:48,650
Lexie, aren't you
going to let him have it?

204
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:50,352
Defend this place?

205
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:51,954
Can't be bothered, Flem.

206
00:09:51,955 --> 00:09:55,257
I can't believe
you think Lassel's

207
00:09:55,258 --> 00:09:57,025
should keep bailing
this place out!

208
00:09:57,026 --> 00:09:59,661
You've spent a lot
of the bank's money!

209
00:09:59,662 --> 00:10:01,230
<i>( clears throat )</i>

210
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:03,799
They'll have
the house white,

211
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,268
I'll sip a bottle
of your chablis.

212
00:10:11,374 --> 00:10:13,275
Soup?

213
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,346
<i>Sorry.</i>

214
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:20,715
Will you be wanting
a baked roll with that, sir?

215
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:23,819
Bally lout! Took me for a waiter!

216
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,320
A little misunderstanding,
that's all.

217
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:27,990
This isn't our home
anymore, is it, Molly?

218
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:30,793
Be with you in a sec. The nick
is just opening up for trading.

219
00:10:30,794 --> 00:10:33,295
Hector, why can't you just
go with the flow a bit?

220
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:35,931
Don't be absurd! For my entire
life, the flow has gone with me!

221
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:38,100
It can't do you any good,
whingeing all the time.

222
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:39,802
"Shut up," is that what you mean?

223
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:41,804
I think I managed
to calm everyone down.

224
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:43,638
Now look here,
my girl,

225
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:46,975
many tyrants have tried to defeat
the MacDonalds of Glenbogle,

226
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:49,144
from butcher cumberland
to adolf hitler, and failed!

227
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:50,879
Hector, please,
you're overreacting.

228
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,149
I've been slapping down uppity females
for 40 years, not gonna stop now!

229
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,551
Molly: Oh, Hector, you
couldn't slap anyone down.

230
00:10:56,552 --> 00:10:59,221
Even if you were holding a
large wet haddock in each hand.

231
00:10:59,222 --> 00:11:00,222
Yeah!

232
00:11:01,357 --> 00:11:02,657
Haddock?

233
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:16,771
Katrina?

234
00:11:20,076 --> 00:11:22,311
Katrina!

235
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:23,812
What is it?

236
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:31,053
It's Justine.
She's-

237
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:33,188
Justine is working
her socks off.

238
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:34,990
I know.

239
00:11:34,991 --> 00:11:37,692
But she's paranoid
about Archie and me.

240
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:39,728
I wonder how she got
that idea?

241
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:44,666
Look...

242
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:47,035
Katrina, could you
take some advice, lass?

243
00:11:47,036 --> 00:11:48,636
Yes!

244
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:49,872
No...

245
00:11:49,873 --> 00:11:52,040
well, maybe.

246
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:55,177
Okay.

247
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:57,779
Let's not heed to think
that I was one of those...

248
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,848
sad fellows that
can only discuss

249
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:02,117
painful human dilemmas,

250
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:04,186
<i>and sporting matters.</i>

251
00:12:04,187 --> 00:12:07,022
<i>But,
if I were you...</i>

252
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:11,193
I would take my line
right out of the water.

253
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:16,398
If I know anything, there's
trouble brewing up there.

254
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:20,269
And I'd hate to see you
get the worst of it.

255
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:34,549
What are you doing?

256
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,584
Writing a list.

257
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:38,287
( sniffs )
Correction...

258
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:41,056
writing a list of all the
other lists I've got to write

259
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:43,058
of all the things
we need to do

260
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:44,692
to put this place
on its feet.

261
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:49,064
Don't worry about the little
scene I had with Hector,

262
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:51,266
it was just
a low level skirmish.

263
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:53,268
I just wish things
weren't so hard for you.

264
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:56,438
I came here
with my eyes open.

265
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:58,673
To work for
a very good cause-

266
00:12:58,674 --> 00:12:59,808
us.

267
00:13:01,945 --> 00:13:03,946
Come here, you!

268
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:05,613
( sneezes )

269
00:13:05,614 --> 00:13:08,083
( groans )

270
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:10,685
I knew I shouldn't have turned
the heating off at easter.

271
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:14,456
I hope the bankers
are okay.

272
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:17,159
Don't worry, Lexie's fattened them up.

273
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,961
They'll need it.

274
00:13:20,863 --> 00:13:22,030
What do you mean?

275
00:13:23,766 --> 00:13:24,732
Come on, tell me.

276
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:27,469
I couldn't.

277
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,538
Mr. Brown is not a man
to cross lightly.

278
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:34,242
<i>( door creaking )</i>

279
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:38,480
<i>( snoring )</i>

280
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:48,790
<i>Justine: Okay, I read a fax for Brown.</i>

281
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,859
<i>It's not a team
building course.</i>

282
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,361
<i>The bank are
cutting back.</i>

283
00:13:52,362 --> 00:13:54,929
Brown has to decide
which one of them

284
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,798
should get
the bullet,

285
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,401
according to
darwinian principles.

286
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:00,602
What?

287
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:02,804
The survival
of the fittest.

288
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:07,542
Oh, no!
Fleming.

289
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:08,843
Fleming?

290
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:14,449
Time for work.

291
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,684
Oh dear.

292
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:24,126
Come on!
Long ways to go.

293
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:35,137
Come on,
Mr. Fleming.

294
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:37,105
If it's
not hurting,

295
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:39,074
it's not doing you
any good.

296
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:44,946
No you don't!

297
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:46,781
Nice guys finish-

298
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:48,316
last!

299
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:50,852
- Mr. Fleming, are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine, really.

300
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:53,721
Brown: Come on, Mr. Fleming,
where's your get-up-and-go?

301
00:14:53,722 --> 00:14:55,223
Got up and went,
did it?

302
00:14:56,426 --> 00:14:58,460
Now on this course,
I will be awarding marks

303
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:00,462
for effort
and achievement.

304
00:15:00,463 --> 00:15:03,665
And the end result will be
used by your employers

305
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,500
<i>for purposes of their own.</i>

306
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:07,835
Who gets promoted,
you mean?

307
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:10,238
So, that's one point
for Mr. Fleming.

308
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,606
<i>Three for Ms. Denning.</i>

309
00:15:11,607 --> 00:15:14,042
And 10 for Mr. Rutter.

310
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:17,312
<i>Rutter: Bottom of the
pile, Fleming, great start.</i>

311
00:15:25,921 --> 00:15:28,290
( growls )

312
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:32,227
( air whooshing )

313
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:38,533
Valve.

314
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:41,436
Valve?! I don't want a bally
boat on my billiard table,

315
00:15:41,437 --> 00:15:42,670
as well as everything else!

316
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,274
- Hector...
- ( snarls )

317
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:51,413
( chimes )

318
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:53,748
<i>Hector:
Enough is enough!</i>

319
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:55,283
<i>Justine: Hector, please, calm down.</i>

320
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:56,784
<i>That is my office,
there...</i>

321
00:15:56,785 --> 00:15:58,052
( sighs )

322
00:15:58,053 --> 00:16:01,456
I do all my research
in there!

323
00:16:01,457 --> 00:16:02,790
It just won't do!

324
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,025
What's the matter?

325
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:05,427
There is nowhere
in this house

326
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:07,395
where a chap can find an
iota of peace and quiet!

327
00:16:07,396 --> 00:16:09,598
That's not surprising with
you bellowing the place down!

328
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,299
<i>Justine:
Hector, I'm sorry.</i>

329
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,168
But we're running
a business here.

330
00:16:13,169 --> 00:16:14,302
Sorry.

331
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:16,338
Right. That's it.
I've had enough.

332
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:17,872
I rather think
I have too.

333
00:16:17,873 --> 00:16:19,241
I'm sorry to say this,
Justine,

334
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:21,009
but there isn't room
for the two of us.

335
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,410
It's not me
that's the problem.

336
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:24,513
I am trying very hard,
but you're just impossible!

337
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:26,881
Molly!

338
00:16:26,882 --> 00:16:29,351
Pack a toothbrush and nightie-
we're moving out!

339
00:16:29,352 --> 00:16:31,153
Monty, come!
Holly!

340
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:32,787
( barking )

341
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:34,322
Did you have to
say that?

342
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:36,358
Can you see
he was annoyed?

343
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:41,563
( air cartridge fires )

344
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:43,064
<i>( metal clangs )</i>

345
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:48,036
What are you doing?

346
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:49,871
Abseiling.

347
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:52,840
Oh... right.

348
00:16:54,477 --> 00:16:56,278
Fleming: I'll go first, Mary.

349
00:16:58,047 --> 00:16:59,681
( wails )

350
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:05,987
( growling )

351
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:08,356
Hector: Puppy! Come on. Go on, get!

352
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:10,358
Monty, Brummel,
fall in!

353
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,427
Quick run to the
retirement home, please.

354
00:17:12,428 --> 00:17:14,996
It's so unnecessary.

355
00:17:14,997 --> 00:17:16,831
<i>Ah! Good man,
good man!</i>

356
00:17:18,301 --> 00:17:20,468
Molly!

357
00:17:20,469 --> 00:17:22,036
<i>Come on, boys.
Come on.</i>

358
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:24,972
Something for your lunch.
And save me a bed.

359
00:17:24,973 --> 00:17:27,041
I might be joining you
very soon.

360
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:28,843
This is absolutely
ridiculous.

361
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:30,812
<i>Molly: Oh-hh, cheer up,
darling. It's for the best.</i>

362
00:17:30,813 --> 00:17:33,981
We're going to the end of the
drive, not the end of the world.

363
00:17:33,982 --> 00:17:35,650
Mother-

364
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:46,228
Fleming:
Mary, that's it.

365
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:48,430
You want to get your legs
just slightly apart.

366
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:50,965
One foot on the top
and the other one on the stone,

367
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:52,867
and then- whoa!
Oooh! Ah-hh!

368
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,687
I love this place.

369
00:18:12,688 --> 00:18:15,957
It's like something out
of Hansel and gretel.

370
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,859
Father, please.

371
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,427
Excuse me.

372
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:22,430
Mother, do you really
have to do this?

373
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:24,932
I'm sorry, I agree
with your father.

374
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:27,302
Can I at least give you
a hand settling in?

375
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:28,637
We can manage,
thank you.

376
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:31,839
What are you going
to do about supper?

377
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:37,312
We shall be dining here,
quietly and simply,

378
00:18:37,313 --> 00:18:40,749
time at last to retire
from public life.

379
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,850
Goodbye.

380
00:18:44,353 --> 00:18:45,654
( huffs )

381
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,725
Do you want
a sandwich?

382
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:05,907
Lexie!

383
00:19:05,908 --> 00:19:08,576
Look what's happening.
Fleming's going to get relegated.

384
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:11,245
Well, he was no great shakes
at the abseiling.

385
00:19:11,246 --> 00:19:13,315
His raft sunk,
and a bee stung him

386
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:15,350
at the end
of his initiative test.

387
00:19:15,351 --> 00:19:17,018
Very painful.

388
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:18,085
( Archie sighs )

389
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:22,524
- Archie...
- huh?

390
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:24,726
Look, I'm really sorry
about this morning.

391
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:27,061
<i>- your dad.
- We'll talk later.</i>

392
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:29,163
I've got to do something
about Fleming first.

393
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:30,732
You can't interfere.

394
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:35,603
Justine-

395
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:37,839
look, we are knee deep
in debt here.

396
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,174
It's only thanks to Fleming
that we're still afloat.

397
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:42,877
Believe me, if he loses his
job, we will be finished!

398
00:19:42,878 --> 00:19:45,913
But he's just one person. It's
the bank we have to keep in with.

399
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:48,650
I know what I'm doing. I'm
acting in our long term interests.

400
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:51,185
No, you're not! You're
threatening them. Stay out of it.

401
00:19:51,186 --> 00:19:53,788
Oh, sorry! And here was me
thinking that I was in charge.

402
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:55,623
If anyone should
stay out of it-

403
00:19:55,624 --> 00:19:58,727
well, I was going to ask your help,
but there's obviously no point.

404
00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:02,764
<i>Brown:
Come on, Mr. Fleming,</i>

405
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:05,299
last chance today
to avoid the wooden spoon.

406
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,401
Oof!

407
00:20:17,112 --> 00:20:20,515
Molly, that cell-like
chamber downstairs?

408
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:23,485
- The drawing room, yes?
- There's a hole in the wall.

409
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:26,554
It's called a hatch. I should be
conveying your supper through it.

410
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:28,723
Baked beans on toast,
and so on.

411
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:31,025
Breakfast and bourbon,
still... needs must.

412
00:20:31,026 --> 00:20:34,195
Oh, not much storage space.

413
00:20:34,196 --> 00:20:37,131
We'll have to share. You take
this side, and I'll take that.

414
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:39,467
I'll use the wardrobe
in my bedroom, can't I?

415
00:20:39,468 --> 00:20:41,068
- No, you can't!
- Whyever not?

416
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:43,237
Because you haven't got
a bedroom. This is it.

417
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:44,406
We'll have to share.

418
00:20:44,407 --> 00:20:46,107
Share a bedroom?!

419
00:20:46,108 --> 00:20:47,709
Be rather cozy, won't it?

420
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:52,447
Man and wife
in the same bedroom?

421
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:53,848
It's not natural!

422
00:20:56,552 --> 00:20:58,152
<i>( car approaching )</i>

423
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,958
Katrina!

424
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,293
Archie?

425
00:21:05,294 --> 00:21:07,829
You've got to come
with me, now!

426
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,364
I can't. I've got to finish
this portrait for tomorrow.

427
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:12,099
I need your help.

428
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,268
I don't think
it's really a good idea.

429
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:16,871
Look, I've got a crisis
with Fleming and the bankers.

430
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:19,006
It's a long story,
but I need you, please!

431
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,044
Archie MacDonald,
you are maddening!

432
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:24,813
Yeah, so everyone tells me.

433
00:21:26,982 --> 00:21:29,083
Brown:
Now, pay close attention.

434
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,887
This is an exercise

435
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:35,323
in intelligence,

436
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:37,592
teamwork,
and individual initiative.

437
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:40,127
You will each drive one of
those all-terrain vehicles

438
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:41,896
back to the house.

439
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:44,899
<i>The only problem is-</i>

440
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,400
there's no petrol
in them.

441
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:48,970
- So how-
- where is the petrol?

442
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:53,942
<i>The petrol is in
those cans in front of you.</i>

443
00:21:53,943 --> 00:21:57,411
So you better start
by bringing them up.

444
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,984
There's got to be
some catch here.

445
00:22:02,985 --> 00:22:04,819
- Hello?
- Hey, hey!

446
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,788
<i>- Mr. Brown!
- excuse me!</i>

447
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:09,624
We're gonna be needing that, I think.

448
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:13,127
Remember, in battle, your
greatest enemy is complacency.

449
00:22:14,697 --> 00:22:16,430
- What?!
- Mary-

450
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:19,200
I'm getting a tad
hacked off with this!

451
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:22,303
<i>- hello?! Mr. Brown?
- hello?</i>

452
00:22:22,304 --> 00:22:25,473
<i>- ( engine starts )
- Mr. Brown!</i>

453
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:27,542
<i>Are you going?</i>

454
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:31,112
<i>All:
Mr. Brown!</i>

455
00:22:40,689 --> 00:22:42,524
More baked beans,
Hector?

456
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:44,559
Thank you, dear.

457
00:22:49,231 --> 00:22:50,565
Lovely.

458
00:22:57,105 --> 00:22:58,573
( dog whines )

459
00:22:58,574 --> 00:23:01,375
<i>Mary: Hello, is there anyone there?</i>

460
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,578
- Any ideas?
- Where's all this water coming from?

461
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:06,080
- The lake. - Actually, it's
a loch- we call it a loch.

462
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:08,482
We'll climb out of here.
Fleming, you be the baseman,

463
00:23:08,483 --> 00:23:11,318
Mary, you're next.
I'm a very experienced climber.

464
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,987
I've done a lot.
Don't worry, okay?

465
00:23:12,988 --> 00:23:14,188
He can't hold
all of us.

466
00:23:14,189 --> 00:23:16,223
You first, come on, Mary.
Get lower.

467
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,059
I'm ready.
I'm braced.

468
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,094
Ready? Okay,
up you go, hup!

469
00:23:20,095 --> 00:23:22,296
Careful, Fleming!
Are you all right?

470
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:24,365
Steady yourself!

471
00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:26,367
- Come on!
- I'm on your shoulders.

472
00:23:26,368 --> 00:23:27,902
Whose idea was this?

473
00:23:27,903 --> 00:23:29,737
Yours, you dolt.
Hold still.

474
00:23:29,738 --> 00:23:31,305
Okay.

475
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:32,740
Are you all right,
Fleming?

476
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:34,408
Hold steady.
Here we go.

477
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:36,277
Hang on.

478
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:37,946
All right,
I've got that one.

479
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:39,313
Okay.

480
00:23:39,314 --> 00:23:41,082
- Are you all right, Flem?
- Yep.

481
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,484
- Okay.
- Whoo!

482
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:45,419
For goodness sake.

483
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,121
Okay, got it,
got it, got it!

484
00:23:47,122 --> 00:23:48,690
Yes, yes, yes.

485
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:50,424
<i>- hang on, hang on.
- What?</i>

486
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:51,559
We need the jerry can.

487
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,394
The what?! Can?

488
00:23:53,395 --> 00:23:55,129
I'm gonna have to-
stay very-

489
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,164
very still.
I got it.

490
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:01,836
<i>- Nigel, you come up now.
- yes, yes.</i>

491
00:24:01,837 --> 00:24:03,504
Okay, okay,
one, two, three.

492
00:24:03,505 --> 00:24:05,773
On the left. Hold on!
I'm losing you on the left!

493
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:07,875
Move over!
Balance!

494
00:24:07,876 --> 00:24:09,911
<i>- Balance there.
- okay?</i>

495
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:11,512
Yep. Okay.

496
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:14,816
Argh!

497
00:24:14,817 --> 00:24:18,019
And... up we go.

498
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,487
Down!
Get down!

499
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:21,723
<i>Both:
Throw the ladder down.</i>

500
00:24:21,724 --> 00:24:24,492
<i>Mary: That's it, pass it
down. Pass it down, Nigel.</i>

501
00:24:24,493 --> 00:24:26,494
Keep coming, keep coming.
Nearly there.

502
00:24:26,495 --> 00:24:27,996
<i>Okay, hang on!</i>

503
00:24:27,997 --> 00:24:31,766
( yelling )

504
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,601
He's thrown
the ladder in!

505
00:24:36,972 --> 00:24:38,239
( sighs )

506
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,540
What a rat.

507
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:46,147
- I'll head him off.
- I'll get the others.

508
00:24:46,148 --> 00:24:48,850
Wee-haa!

509
00:24:54,156 --> 00:24:57,258
Yeah! Losers!

510
00:24:58,393 --> 00:25:00,762
- ( screaming )
- Hold onto the can!

511
00:25:00,763 --> 00:25:02,697
Fleming! Fleming!

512
00:25:02,698 --> 00:25:05,099
<i>Throw me the ladder!
Come on!</i>

513
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,801
- We can't!
- Throw it up!

514
00:25:06,802 --> 00:25:08,169
Find something else.

515
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:11,072
- I'll get some rope.
- ( screaming )

516
00:25:12,841 --> 00:25:14,876
<i>Hold onto the can!</i>

517
00:25:14,877 --> 00:25:16,911
<i>Grab onto the can!</i>

518
00:25:16,912 --> 00:25:19,647
There! There!

519
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:20,581
Tie it on, come on!

520
00:25:24,987 --> 00:25:26,620
Okay, come on!

521
00:25:26,621 --> 00:25:28,790
Here I come, okay?

522
00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:36,064
Oh, what now?!

523
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:41,836
My boyfriend's truck shed a
load of timber up the path.

524
00:25:41,837 --> 00:25:43,838
But if you're looking
for Glenbogle House,

525
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:45,339
you can reach it
up that track there.

526
00:25:58,721 --> 00:26:00,755
Come on, buddy.

527
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:03,091
Okay.

528
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:05,159
- Come on, hurry up!
- Let's get going.

529
00:26:07,562 --> 00:26:09,363
You better take it easy, Fleming,

530
00:26:09,364 --> 00:26:10,832
there's not much
fuel here.

531
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,666
Keep your wig on, Arch,
it's only a game.

532
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:15,402
It's not just a game,
Flem, it's a test.

533
00:26:15,403 --> 00:26:17,571
If you don't win this,
you will lose your job.

534
00:26:17,572 --> 00:26:19,373
And therefore, we will lose our home!

535
00:26:19,374 --> 00:26:20,875
Now go on!

536
00:26:25,614 --> 00:26:27,815
( Rutter humming )

537
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:35,823
Mary: Come on, faster,
make it go faster.

538
00:26:35,824 --> 00:26:38,025
Fleming: My foot's flat to the floor.

539
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:40,027
We're nearly there.
Careful.

540
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:44,498
Oop, oop,
hold it, Nigel.

541
00:26:51,473 --> 00:26:53,875
- Mary: Whee!
- Flat out, we're flat out!

542
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:56,710
Mary: Come on, go faster.
Have we got enough petrol?

543
00:26:56,711 --> 00:26:58,545
It's slightly in the red.
I'm sure it's fine.

544
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,822
<i>Mary:
Whee-hee!</i>

545
00:27:09,224 --> 00:27:11,993
I think
we're ahead of him!

546
00:27:11,994 --> 00:27:13,895
I can't see him,
keep going!

547
00:27:18,066 --> 00:27:20,601
Yee-haw!

548
00:27:20,602 --> 00:27:22,036
The winner!

549
00:27:24,606 --> 00:27:26,107
Oh, look,
there he is!

550
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:31,946
Keep going,
keep going!

551
00:27:41,056 --> 00:27:43,490
No! No fuel?!

552
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:44,692
Whoo-ooo!

553
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:48,930
Come on!
Come on!

554
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:51,432
Come on!
Yeah!

555
00:27:58,406 --> 00:28:00,607
- Oh.
- Sorry.

556
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:27,068
( giggling )

557
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,074
Did you see
Fleming's face?

558
00:28:33,075 --> 00:28:35,243
What about Nigel's?
Wah-hah!

559
00:28:35,244 --> 00:28:36,944
<i>( both laughing )</i>

560
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,185
Problem solved.

561
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:47,454
Is it though?

562
00:28:47,455 --> 00:28:49,623
<i>Huh?</i>

563
00:28:49,624 --> 00:28:51,658
<i>It seems to me, that
there's a big problem here</i>

564
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:53,660
that no one's facing.
( sighs )

565
00:28:53,661 --> 00:28:55,696
We only seem
to enjoy ourselves when

566
00:28:55,697 --> 00:28:57,698
we're sneaking around
behind Justine's back.

567
00:28:57,699 --> 00:28:59,466
<i>Aw, come on.</i>

568
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:03,037
<i>And it's making me
very unhappy.</i>

569
00:29:04,106 --> 00:29:05,806
And what about you?

570
00:29:05,807 --> 00:29:07,608
<i>Are you happy?</i>

571
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:10,811
I don't know.

572
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,382
No.

573
00:29:17,085 --> 00:29:18,819
I want to go home.

574
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,023
All of a sudden,
I'm tired, hungry,

575
00:29:22,024 --> 00:29:24,058
and- very miserable.

576
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,960
I'm sorry.

577
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,664
Why don't I give you
a lift to your car?

578
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:32,466
No.

579
00:29:34,136 --> 00:29:36,137
You go home to Justine.

580
00:29:57,592 --> 00:29:58,993
Now then...

581
00:30:00,228 --> 00:30:02,063
<i>ah ha!</i>

582
00:30:03,365 --> 00:30:04,932
Ah-hh.

583
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:07,734
Come in.

584
00:30:11,206 --> 00:30:12,373
No-

585
00:30:13,475 --> 00:30:15,642
you've left
something behind.

586
00:30:15,643 --> 00:30:18,045
Oh! That's the trouble
with packing in a hurry.

587
00:30:18,046 --> 00:30:19,813
Very thoughtful of you,
thank you.

588
00:30:21,016 --> 00:30:22,883
Playing with
Archie's toy-

589
00:30:22,884 --> 00:30:25,086
you surprise me,
Hector.

590
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:27,621
I'll have you know, I was
signals officer in my battalion.

591
00:30:27,622 --> 00:30:30,057
Trouble is Archie's put the
cameras in all the wrong places.

592
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:32,493
If I'm going to stay here,
I have to do something about it.

593
00:30:32,494 --> 00:30:34,161
And how is the new billet?

594
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:35,896
Marvelous! Should have
done it years ago.

595
00:30:35,897 --> 00:30:38,632
Little house,
simple life, marvelous.

596
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:41,168
I'd like you
to come home, Hector.

597
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:42,269
Pardon?

598
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,905
You being here
makes Archie feel bad,

599
00:30:44,906 --> 00:30:46,673
and I miss you.

600
00:30:46,674 --> 00:30:48,142
Me?

601
00:30:49,544 --> 00:30:51,578
You're like an itch.

602
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:53,747
Extremely irritating,
but without it,

603
00:30:53,748 --> 00:30:56,083
one is denied the pleasure
of a good scratch.

604
00:30:56,084 --> 00:30:57,485
Oh.
( chuckles )

605
00:30:59,421 --> 00:31:03,057
I'm sorry if I've been
a pain in the neck recently.

606
00:31:03,058 --> 00:31:05,692
I'm sorry too,
my dear.

607
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:07,861
You're not really
very happy here, are you?

608
00:31:09,464 --> 00:31:10,998
Damn.

609
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:12,900
<i>Sorry.</i>

610
00:31:19,341 --> 00:31:22,109
<i>( piano playing )</i>

611
00:31:33,688 --> 00:31:35,889
I didn't know you
could play the piano.

612
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,758
I can't!

613
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:41,262
( melancholy music playing )

614
00:31:41,263 --> 00:31:43,497
<i>Oh,
I love this stuff.</i>

615
00:31:43,498 --> 00:31:45,399
Matches my mood.

616
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,568
Got the blues,
have you?

617
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:50,471
A slight case
of the darkenings maybe.

618
00:31:52,207 --> 00:31:54,408
Things just aren't the same
around here, Flem.

619
00:31:55,643 --> 00:31:58,245
Nor at Lassel's Bank,
I'm afraid.

620
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:02,816
There's something I've
always wanted to ask you,

621
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:05,852
how a nice girl like you
ended up in a place like this?

622
00:32:05,853 --> 00:32:07,721
Me?

623
00:32:07,722 --> 00:32:10,191
I came to Glenbogle
to forget.

624
00:32:10,192 --> 00:32:12,093
Forget what?

625
00:32:13,828 --> 00:32:16,163
Can't remember.

626
00:32:16,164 --> 00:32:18,899
What were you saying
about the bank?

627
00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:22,303
I don't know.

628
00:32:22,304 --> 00:32:25,038
It was never that
exciting a job, but now-

629
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,976
ruthless young tykes like Nigel
trying to put you down,

630
00:32:28,977 --> 00:32:31,445
new management's
forcing you to fight

631
00:32:31,446 --> 00:32:33,380
for a job you don't
really want...

632
00:32:33,381 --> 00:32:35,916
- pack it in then.
- Do what?

633
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:38,018
I don't know.

634
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:39,853
Play the piano?

635
00:32:39,854 --> 00:32:42,156
Write symphonies.

636
00:32:42,157 --> 00:32:43,591
( chuckles )

637
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:45,926
I'm not sure I've got
the courage for that, Lex.

638
00:32:45,927 --> 00:32:48,596
Besides, old Archie
needs me where I am.

639
00:32:50,098 --> 00:32:51,898
If I lost my job...

640
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:53,934
<i>Flem, this is your life.</i>

641
00:32:53,935 --> 00:32:56,337
<i>Not Archie's.</i>

642
00:32:58,473 --> 00:33:01,008
You've got to follow
your heart.

643
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:03,644
If you're not
happy in life-

644
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,148
what's the point in it?

645
00:34:01,703 --> 00:34:03,870
<i>( birds singing )</i>

646
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:12,979
This camera's no good here at all.

647
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,981
I said it'd be
better off in the house.

648
00:34:14,982 --> 00:34:16,983
All right!
Give me a hand.

649
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:20,521
Come on, come on,
come on!

650
00:34:40,308 --> 00:34:41,609
Father,
you're back.

651
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,410
<i>What are you
doing?</i>

652
00:34:43,411 --> 00:34:46,513
Nothing.

653
00:34:48,516 --> 00:34:51,017
Archie?

654
00:34:51,018 --> 00:34:53,053
Are you all right?

655
00:34:53,054 --> 00:34:55,188
Just listen-

656
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:58,024
I came to tell you I won't
be coming here anymore.

657
00:34:58,025 --> 00:34:59,260
What?!

658
00:34:59,261 --> 00:35:01,562
Archie, let's be honest
with each other,

659
00:35:01,563 --> 00:35:03,764
we're not just friends.

660
00:35:03,765 --> 00:35:06,066
<i>It's much more
than that.</i>

661
00:35:06,067 --> 00:35:09,236
You know it, I know it
and Justine knows it.

662
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:11,838
And not unnaturally,
she resents it.

663
00:35:12,907 --> 00:35:14,541
Oh...

664
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:16,543
hi.

665
00:35:16,544 --> 00:35:19,112
Lexie hasn't prepared
the banker's rations,

666
00:35:19,113 --> 00:35:20,381
<i>so I'm going
to sort it out.</i>

667
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:28,355
<i>And it's causing us
all a lot of grief.</i>

668
00:35:28,356 --> 00:35:31,425
So I've decided the only way
to make it more bearable

669
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:33,193
is just not
to come here,

670
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:35,028
and not to see you.

671
00:35:35,029 --> 00:35:38,198
<i>( Lexie's voice raised )</i>

672
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:40,334
I think we'd all be
a lot happier that way.

673
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:43,337
- Katrina, you can't just-
- I'm sorry.

674
00:35:43,338 --> 00:35:46,607
<i>- Lexie: of course, she who knows everything.
- Justine: the games you play.</i>

675
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:49,476
<i>- I don't play games, darling.
- You've been against me from day one.</i>

676
00:35:49,477 --> 00:35:51,412
A little look here,
a snide remark there.

677
00:35:51,413 --> 00:35:54,415
I fight battles and I'm warning
you before this one kicks off,

678
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:56,517
- I take no prisoners.
- Of course I know why.

679
00:35:56,518 --> 00:35:58,952
Apparently yet another
female's after my boyfriend.

680
00:35:58,953 --> 00:36:01,322
Well, don't even think
about trying it!

681
00:36:01,323 --> 00:36:03,223
Despite your rather obvious
attractions,

682
00:36:03,224 --> 00:36:04,792
you're not serious
competition.

683
00:36:04,793 --> 00:36:06,159
( scoffs )
For you?!

684
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,329
You've got as much charisma
as a rolled up carpet.

685
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,932
Don't flare your nostrils at that, 'cause
you'll get house martins nesting in them!

686
00:36:11,933 --> 00:36:13,534
Right, that's it!

687
00:36:13,535 --> 00:36:15,168
What is the problem now?

688
00:36:15,169 --> 00:36:16,903
- Her!
- Her!

689
00:36:24,212 --> 00:36:26,079
How are you feeling,
Mary?

690
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,048
I'm fine.

691
00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:31,685
You know, you're really
very kind, Fleming.

692
00:36:31,686 --> 00:36:33,019
Do you know that?

693
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,489
Girls are always
saying that.

694
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,559
I wish they'd call me a
filthy brute one of these days.

695
00:36:40,362 --> 00:36:41,762
Brown:
Right.

696
00:36:41,763 --> 00:36:44,565
Jump off at
the starboard side,

697
00:36:44,566 --> 00:36:46,500
swim underneath
the boat,

698
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:48,635
and climb back on
board on the port side.

699
00:36:48,636 --> 00:36:50,337
Right,
who's first?

700
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,708
I brought the garlic press,
the wooden spoons,

701
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:56,510
as for the pots and pans,
well, I think-

702
00:36:56,511 --> 00:36:58,545
will you stop going on
about the kitchen utensils,

703
00:36:58,546 --> 00:37:00,180
and tell me what
all this is about?

704
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:01,448
I am leaving Glenbogle,

705
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:03,784
due to personal differences
with Mrs. Laird, here!

706
00:37:03,785 --> 00:37:05,886
She's got to go.
We cannot carry on like this!

707
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:07,254
You said it, girl!

708
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:09,122
Right. Fine.
I'll help you pack!

709
00:37:09,123 --> 00:37:11,625
Will you both
be quiet!

710
00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:13,427
Let me think!

711
00:37:13,428 --> 00:37:16,162
Nobody does anything.
Nobody moves.

712
00:37:16,163 --> 00:37:18,231
You- just stay here.

713
00:37:18,232 --> 00:37:20,166
Justine, have you
got a minute, please?

714
00:37:21,836 --> 00:37:23,704
This I have to hear.

715
00:37:23,705 --> 00:37:25,439
Oh no, Lexie.
Lexie!

716
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,275
Just give them a bit
of privacy.

717
00:37:28,276 --> 00:37:30,577
( sobbing )
I can't do this!

718
00:37:30,578 --> 00:37:32,479
That might have
unfortunate consequences.

719
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,715
As you already hitched
a lift on Mr. Fleming's car,

720
00:37:34,716 --> 00:37:36,216
you're now
in bottom place.

721
00:37:36,217 --> 00:37:38,819
That's not fair. And
anyway, I can't swim!

722
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,154
Then you'll just have to shut
your eyes and think of England.

723
00:37:41,155 --> 00:37:42,556
- Jump!
- ( shrieks )

724
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:43,924
Fleming:
Mr. Brown?

725
00:37:43,925 --> 00:37:45,893
You may have heard of
a historical personage

726
00:37:45,894 --> 00:37:47,360
called Captain Bligh.

727
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:49,463
He was the commander of a vessel
called "The Bounty,"

728
00:37:49,464 --> 00:37:52,466
which also happens to be the
name of my favorite chocolate bar!

729
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:53,767
What?

730
00:37:53,768 --> 00:37:54,802
Whoa!

731
00:37:56,604 --> 00:37:59,205
Fleming!

732
00:37:59,206 --> 00:38:02,175
<i>Fleming: Sorry, I didn't
have a plank to hand.</i>

733
00:38:02,176 --> 00:38:04,411
And by the way,
Mr. Brown, remember-

734
00:38:04,412 --> 00:38:07,681
in battle, complacency
is your greatest enemy.

735
00:38:07,682 --> 00:38:10,584
And I'd say that's you
sunk as well, old man.

736
00:38:14,923 --> 00:38:16,623
Oh-hh!

737
00:38:16,624 --> 00:38:18,291
Hector,
I'm going shopping,

738
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:19,893
is there anything
you need?

739
00:38:19,894 --> 00:38:22,563
Some hardtack biscuits
and the "Telegraph," my dear.

740
00:38:22,564 --> 00:38:24,431
What are you doing?

741
00:38:24,432 --> 00:38:26,366
These cameras are
in the wrong place!

742
00:38:26,367 --> 00:38:28,335
I miss the hustle
and bustle of the house.

743
00:38:28,336 --> 00:38:29,770
But with Duncan's help-
ah-hh!

744
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:31,905
- Got it sorted.
- Yeah.

745
00:38:31,906 --> 00:38:35,308
<i>- There.
- splendid.</i>

746
00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:38,979
- Oh, I say... - Justine: You've obviously
got something to say, so say it!

747
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,481
I know it's not
easy for you,

748
00:38:40,482 --> 00:38:43,550
coming to a place that isn't
your favorite spot in the world.

749
00:38:43,551 --> 00:38:45,051
No! It isn't!

750
00:38:45,052 --> 00:38:47,153
It was a sacrifice
I made to be with you.

751
00:38:47,154 --> 00:38:48,321
Argh!

752
00:38:48,322 --> 00:38:50,123
<i>Molly:
No, try again!</i>

753
00:38:50,124 --> 00:38:53,527
I wanted see what she
was going to say to him.

754
00:38:53,528 --> 00:38:55,395
Give them a minute's peace.
It's their right.

755
00:38:55,396 --> 00:38:57,698
Lexie, may I
have a word?

756
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:59,399
- What?
- Don't say anything.

757
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,969
I must say this quickly.
I've been thinking.

758
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,571
You said I should have
the courage to follow my heart.

759
00:39:04,572 --> 00:39:06,507
Yeah?

760
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:09,109
Would you have the courage
to follow it with me?

761
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,512
Flem, the way
I'm feeling right now-

762
00:39:11,513 --> 00:39:12,713
<i>( whistling )</i>

763
00:39:12,714 --> 00:39:14,014
Golly! Lexie!

764
00:39:14,015 --> 00:39:16,016
Come and see this!

765
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,256
<i>Archie: I know it's not
easy working with people</i>

766
00:39:23,257 --> 00:39:25,358
- you didn't choose.
- Who can't stand me,

767
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,093
but have the hots
for my boyfriend, yes!

768
00:39:27,094 --> 00:39:28,896
But you are
forcing them out!

769
00:39:28,897 --> 00:39:30,797
<i>People that
I am fond of, yes,</i>

770
00:39:30,798 --> 00:39:32,198
but also people who
could help us here!

771
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:34,100
Come on, Archie!
It's not about other people.

772
00:39:34,101 --> 00:39:36,703
So why don't you tell me
what you really think?

773
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,072
Go on, Archie,
tell her!

774
00:39:39,073 --> 00:39:40,941
I don't believe we
should be watching this.

775
00:39:40,942 --> 00:39:42,342
No.

776
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:45,412
This isn't going to be easy,
but it has to be said.

777
00:39:45,413 --> 00:39:47,247
Hector,
could you possibly

778
00:39:47,248 --> 00:39:48,882
turn up the volume?
A smidgen?

779
00:39:55,456 --> 00:39:58,592
Archie: I think you're taking over.
You're trying to do everything.

780
00:39:58,593 --> 00:40:00,827
You're breathing
everyone else's oxygen.

781
00:40:00,828 --> 00:40:03,263
- Yours as well, I take it?
- Yes!

782
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:06,833
Look, Justine,
this is my home,

783
00:40:06,834 --> 00:40:09,169
my inheritance,
my challenge.

784
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,904
And there's
no room for me?

785
00:40:10,905 --> 00:40:12,839
That's what
you're saying, isn't it?

786
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,675
No, I'm not-
of course, I'm not!

787
00:40:15,743 --> 00:40:17,644
They're moving.

788
00:40:17,645 --> 00:40:19,646
<i>No, no, no,
Hector!</i>

789
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:24,484
Right, so we just
click on Glenbogle. com,

790
00:40:24,485 --> 00:40:26,252
and let's see
what we can see...

791
00:40:26,253 --> 00:40:28,455
there's the loch.

792
00:40:28,456 --> 00:40:30,457
We all know the loch,
don't we?

793
00:40:32,961 --> 00:40:36,429
And remember, this is actually
happening, right now.

794
00:40:38,532 --> 00:40:42,035
Archie: You've got it wrong,
sweetheart, and not for the first time.

795
00:40:42,036 --> 00:40:45,072
<i>Justine: Look, I know
I'm an outsider here,</i>

796
00:40:45,073 --> 00:40:47,107
Glenbogle isn't my home-

797
00:40:47,108 --> 00:40:49,810
that's a long way south
and I miss it like hell.

798
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:52,913
My family,
my friends, my life-

799
00:40:55,216 --> 00:40:57,383
I gave it all up so that
we could be together.

800
00:40:57,384 --> 00:40:58,852
I know that.

801
00:40:58,853 --> 00:41:00,787
But it's not working, is it?

802
00:41:02,556 --> 00:41:04,891
I don't mean other people,
I mean us.

803
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:08,061
What do you think?

804
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:10,430
<i>Tell me.</i>

805
00:41:16,904 --> 00:41:19,139
It's not the same.

806
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,574
It's different, you know.
We've changed.

807
00:41:23,011 --> 00:41:25,278
Can we get it back?

808
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:27,648
<i>What we had once?</i>

809
00:41:30,518 --> 00:41:32,585
I'm not sure
that we can.

810
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:35,989
I'm sorry.

811
00:41:37,992 --> 00:41:39,693
<i>What do you think?</i>

812
00:41:41,162 --> 00:41:44,430
To be honest, I think I lost you
the moment you came up here.

813
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,001
I curse this place.

814
00:41:51,572 --> 00:41:53,940
Thank you for being honest.

815
00:41:53,941 --> 00:41:56,276
I'll go and pack my bags.

816
00:42:13,594 --> 00:42:16,296
Poor Archie.

817
00:42:16,297 --> 00:42:18,999
( kids groan )

818
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,569
Poor Justine.

819
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:25,538
How distressing.

820
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:28,208
Duncan:
He needs neighbors.

821
00:42:31,412 --> 00:42:33,714
Lexie:
Oh...

822
00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:36,616
Fleming!

823
00:42:36,617 --> 00:42:39,319
<i>Fleming: Off to ring the head office?</i>

824
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,387
Tell them to do
their rotten job.

825
00:42:41,388 --> 00:42:43,056
He doesn't have to.

826
00:42:43,057 --> 00:42:45,291
I'm your new boss.

827
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:46,893
Eh?

828
00:42:46,894 --> 00:42:49,863
I take over as head of domestic
finance division next week.

829
00:42:49,864 --> 00:42:50,964
You?

830
00:42:50,965 --> 00:42:53,566
You lied,
you exploited us.

831
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,502
I had to look at the two of you
under challenging conditions.

832
00:42:56,503 --> 00:42:58,705
To find out which of us
gets the job?

833
00:42:58,706 --> 00:42:59,973
Downsizing
is an option...

834
00:42:59,974 --> 00:43:02,008
as is flattening out
management structures.

835
00:43:02,009 --> 00:43:04,811
I consider myself
managerially flattened,

836
00:43:04,812 --> 00:43:06,179
and personally reborn.

837
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,948
Anyway,
I've made up my mind.

838
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:09,182
Eh?

839
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:12,886
Nigel, you are dull,
boorish, arrogant,

840
00:43:12,887 --> 00:43:15,388
totally lacking in humor
or compassion, so you're fired.

841
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:18,625
- But I have-
- I said, you're fired.

842
00:43:26,033 --> 00:43:27,868
<i>As for you, Fleming...</i>

843
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:31,738
you have shown courage,
leadership, loyalty,

844
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:33,140
<i>and independence of spirit.</i>

845
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:34,941
Hasn't he, Mr. Brown?

846
00:43:34,942 --> 00:43:37,177
In other words...

847
00:43:37,178 --> 00:43:41,614
Lancelot.
My perfect number two.

848
00:43:41,615 --> 00:43:43,449
No, no...
no, you don't.

849
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:44,951
<i>I quit.</i>

850
00:43:44,952 --> 00:43:46,953
I'm going to tinkle
the ivories for a living,

851
00:43:46,954 --> 00:43:50,423
and she will be
my muse and manager.

852
00:43:50,424 --> 00:43:52,558
Flem, have you
got a minute?

853
00:44:03,504 --> 00:44:06,873
You don't have to run off
like this. I could drive you.

854
00:44:06,874 --> 00:44:08,775
To the station?

855
00:44:10,511 --> 00:44:12,412
No thanks.

856
00:44:15,516 --> 00:44:18,484
Say goodbye to everyone
for me, will you?

857
00:44:18,485 --> 00:44:20,353
Don't think I can
face them just now.

858
00:44:23,224 --> 00:44:26,392
We did love each other once,
didn't we, Archie?

859
00:44:26,393 --> 00:44:28,695
Yes, we did.

860
00:44:36,737 --> 00:44:38,571
Be happy.

861
00:44:47,281 --> 00:44:49,983
<i>( engine starts )</i>

862
00:44:49,984 --> 00:44:52,319
<i>( car departing )</i>

863
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,739
So she's gone,
and not coming back?

864
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,575
Which means you're not
going anywhere.

865
00:45:17,478 --> 00:45:20,947
I understand.

866
00:45:20,948 --> 00:45:23,850
Lucky old Archie.
That's what I say.

867
00:45:24,919 --> 00:45:26,819
You're a sweetie.

868
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,623
My mother use to say
something similar...

869
00:45:30,624 --> 00:45:33,426
cough drop...
she use to call me.

870
00:45:42,503 --> 00:45:43,469
Oh...

871
00:45:44,538 --> 00:45:46,639
I suppose I better
go find Mary

872
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,376
before she offers that
promotion to someone else.

873
00:45:50,444 --> 00:45:51,677
You know, Lex?

874
00:45:51,678 --> 00:45:54,314
I rather think she fancies me.

875
00:46:08,896 --> 00:46:10,897
Ah... good man.

876
00:46:10,898 --> 00:46:12,865
It's lovely to be back in our home.

877
00:46:12,866 --> 00:46:15,101
Fun though, wasn't it?

878
00:46:15,102 --> 00:46:17,703
Thanks, Duncan.
Hugh, Monty, come on!

879
00:46:17,704 --> 00:46:19,339
Come here.
Heel.

880
00:46:52,673 --> 00:46:54,874
How're you doing?

881
00:46:57,511 --> 00:46:59,779
Pretty strange
actually.

882
00:47:01,248 --> 00:47:03,516
Justine has left.

883
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:06,552
I know.

884
00:47:12,593 --> 00:47:14,494
It's weird.

885
00:47:15,596 --> 00:47:18,164
We were together
five years.

886
00:47:21,268 --> 00:47:25,138
I feel really sad,
but I also feel...

887
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:27,374
lighter, you know?

888
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:28,674
Is that terrible?

889
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:31,144
No.

890
00:47:37,518 --> 00:47:39,886
Anyway...

891
00:47:39,887 --> 00:47:42,322
I think I'm going
to need your help.

892
00:47:43,624 --> 00:47:45,658
Why do you think
I'm here?

893
00:47:48,629 --> 00:47:51,764
I've had this idea about
hiring someone

894
00:47:51,765 --> 00:47:54,934
to help with
the tourist business.

895
00:47:54,935 --> 00:47:56,302
What do you think?

896
00:47:56,303 --> 00:47:58,804
Hmmm...

897
00:48:12,486 --> 00:48:14,387
( deep sigh )

898
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,034
( whirring )

899
00:48:29,303 --> 00:48:30,537
Duncan!
