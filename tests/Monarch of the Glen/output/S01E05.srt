00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,234
Katrina, hi.

6
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:32,804
- You're up bright and early.
- I know. I had work to do, so-

7
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:35,606
"work?" you still haven't grasped the
concept of being a Laird, have you?

8
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:39,044
I suppose if I was a school
teacher, I could knock off at 3:00?

9
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:40,912
Were you looking
for a fight?

10
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:47,986
- I just wanted to talk it through with you.
- Pity you didn't.

11
00:00:47,987 --> 00:00:51,522
- There's an opportunity here for
the whole of Glenbogle. - It's an eyesore.

12
00:00:51,523 --> 00:00:54,659
"Glenbogle Spring Water,
the taste of the Highlands. "

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,695
I can't believe I didn't
think of this before.

14
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:58,997
People will pay good money
for pure water.

15
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:00,865
We start off selling
to restaurants,

16
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:03,768
Then release it in a few selected
chains... Build a reputation,

17
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:06,337
- Go national. We could even take on Europe.
- Easy, Adolf.

18
00:01:06,338 --> 00:01:09,040
There's jobs in it, Katrina.
Income for the whole community.

19
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,542
And for your estate.

20
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:13,912
So I've got six months
of wolf whistles

21
00:01:13,913 --> 00:01:16,081
And builder's bum
to look forward to?

22
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:18,149
Katrina, you'll hardly
notice they're here.

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,985
These boys are professionals.
They know what they're doing.

24
00:01:20,986 --> 00:01:23,855
- ( explosion ) - man: Switch it off.
Pull the lever on the left!

25
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:25,724
<i>- Go on, pull it.
- I'm pulling it!</i>

26
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:27,291
You were saying?

27
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:29,694
- The other left.
- What other left?

28
00:01:29,695 --> 00:01:31,629
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

29
00:02:05,364 --> 00:02:07,331
Well, of course
they hit granite.

30
00:02:07,332 --> 00:02:09,700
Half of Scotland
is made of granite.

31
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:12,370
I shelled out a fortune
for a geological survey.

32
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:14,572
Don't tell me you
didn't read it?

33
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:16,641
Just get a new
drill bit.

34
00:02:16,642 --> 00:02:19,377
Switzerland?! Och.

35
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:21,813
Right, right, right.

36
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:23,214
Okay, thank you.

37
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:24,949
How's the new well going?

38
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,952
It's a rather small hole in the
ground filled with rain water.

39
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:30,388
Really? I thought
we had lots of those.

40
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:32,390
- Who's the letter from?
- Your sister.

41
00:02:32,391 --> 00:02:35,660
I've always wondered why you didn't
see more of each other in London?

42
00:02:35,661 --> 00:02:37,929
- It's a big place.
- But Lizzie's in PR.

43
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,031
She could have helped you
launch your restaurant.

44
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:42,233
Yeah, she helped launch
The Angels' Table.

45
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:44,769
They threw out all the food
critics on the first night.

46
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:49,073
- That was Lizzie's idea.
- You see? That got lots of publicity.

47
00:02:49,074 --> 00:02:52,944
It didn't get very much when the
restaurant folded a couple of weeks later.

48
00:02:52,945 --> 00:02:56,080
Ah, maybe that's why she
needs a change of scenery.

49
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:57,515
What?

50
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:01,019
Oh, no.

51
00:03:02,454 --> 00:03:03,988
Well, write back.

52
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:05,790
Tell her we've moved
to Australia.

53
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,793
I think you'll have
to tell her yourself.

54
00:03:08,794 --> 00:03:11,329
Are the midges biting,
or are my ears burning?

55
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,664
- Lizzie, darling.
- Hello, mommy.

56
00:03:13,665 --> 00:03:15,499
Hello, Archie.

57
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,402
<i>Love the wellies.
Very man of the soil.</i>

58
00:03:18,403 --> 00:03:20,404
Hi, liz. Nice of you
to tell us you were coming.

59
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:23,908
I did. Oh, same old
postie I see, hopeless.

60
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:27,712
Archie, be a darling and take
Lizzie's bag upstairs.

61
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:31,182
Actually, there's a few things
out in the van if you're not busy.

62
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:33,684
Right.

63
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,892
<i>Man: It just feels so right being here.</i>

64
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:44,395
Hi, you must be Archie.

65
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:46,097
I'm Gerald.

66
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:48,333
Gerald Matthews.

67
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:54,239
And this is Janice,
and Neil, and Seabreeze.

68
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,074
Lizzie.

69
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:58,042
I heard all about
the house, but...

70
00:03:58,043 --> 00:03:59,744
It's amazing.

71
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:01,746
Hector: What's this,
more blasted tinkers?

72
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:03,481
Lizzie: No, daddy.
They're friends of mine.

73
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:06,650
Lizzie, good god,
aren't you married yet?

74
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:09,453
Gerald, this is
Hector, my father.

75
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:10,821
<i>Gerald:
I guessed.</i>

76
00:04:10,822 --> 00:04:12,156
How do you do?

77
00:04:12,157 --> 00:04:13,624
Morning.

78
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,459
Where did you spring from?

79
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,561
Your loins.
Had you forgotten?

80
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:20,831
You're home now, girlie. We
don't discuss loins in public.

81
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:23,734
Don't just stand there, lad.
Give them a hand.

82
00:04:25,504 --> 00:04:27,305
Here, let me.

83
00:04:27,306 --> 00:04:28,706
It's heavy.

84
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:31,642
No, it's no bother.

85
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:36,147
Really, Archie. Drilling holes
in the place is one thing.

86
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:38,616
You might have mentioned you
were planning a pop festival.

87
00:04:40,185 --> 00:04:42,153
I'll put them in the guest
bedrooms, shall I?

88
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:44,055
Yes, please, Duncan.
Thanks.

89
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:47,725
Lexie!

90
00:04:47,726 --> 00:04:49,894
<i>Any chance
of a fry-up?</i>

91
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:51,896
Only we don't
eat red meat.

92
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:54,832
Right. Fried porridge all round then?

93
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,069
<i>- Can you do us kedgeree?
- We've not got any haddock.</i>

94
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,038
It'll have to be
smoked salmon?

95
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:01,906
Oh, brilliant.

96
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:04,508
- What?
- Come away in.

97
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,049
Lizzie? You do know we're trying

98
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,151
To get paying
visitors in here?

99
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:14,885
I'm not surprised
business is thin

100
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:17,155
With you scowling at the
guests as if they had fleas.

101
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:19,390
Our rates are �40 a
night, we don't accept

102
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:21,859
Credit cards, tarot
cards, or joss sticks.

103
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,727
Believe me,
they'll pay their way.

104
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:26,497
- How, exactly?
- All in good time.

105
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,833
Now if you don't mind,
I'm famished.

106
00:05:32,938 --> 00:05:35,706
If you need anything,
Lexie will sort you out.

107
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:38,176
- Not you?
- No.

108
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:40,044
I work with
the ghillie.

109
00:05:40,045 --> 00:05:43,181
I don't spend that much
time in the big house.

110
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:45,850
That's a shame.

111
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:47,485
No, not at all.

112
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:49,687
I'd rather be...

113
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:51,222
Out and about,

114
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:54,658
Looking after
the wildlife, you know?

115
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,296
It must demand
tremendous skill.

116
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:00,264
Och, no.
Not really.

117
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:03,134
It's just a matter of being
aware of your surroundings...

118
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:05,103
Knowing where
to put your feet.

119
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:12,377
- You'll have to show me sometime.
- Aye, sure.

120
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:17,348
Anyway,
uh, catch you later.

121
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:23,154
So, how's the hp
business?

122
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:25,556
I wouldn't know,
daddy, I'm in PR.

123
00:06:25,557 --> 00:06:27,791
- How are you two?
- Oh, much the same.

124
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,727
A little seized up
at the joints.

125
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:32,330
You should let Neil give you
a massage. He's very talented.

126
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:34,165
Really?
How interesting.

127
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,667
- Shiatsu?
- Bless you.

128
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:38,669
It'll be nice
to see Golly again.

129
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,039
You'll be lucky.
Blasted fellow's gone awol.

130
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,840
There's moss growing
in my shotguns.

131
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:44,542
How are you doing
for money?

132
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:46,911
- I beg your pardon?
- ( sighs )

133
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:48,946
We try not to think
about it.

134
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:50,281
Maybe you should...

135
00:06:50,282 --> 00:06:53,317
Because I've got an idea
that's worth millions.

136
00:06:53,318 --> 00:06:56,254
I'm sure Archie would
love to hear about it.

137
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,290
Archie? I'm putting
it to the Laird.

138
00:07:00,492 --> 00:07:03,961
I'll, uh, go and have
another look for Golly.

139
00:07:03,962 --> 00:07:06,630
I think he may
have been taken by a pike.

140
00:07:06,631 --> 00:07:09,500
I'm sorry, Lizzie,
I thought we told everyone.

141
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,470
Well, it's all very
legal and boring,

142
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:14,305
But Archie's
the Laird now.

143
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:17,141
Well...

144
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,212
Congratulations.

145
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:23,481
I think I'll
just go and see

146
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:25,416
If that-
Neil's about.

147
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:32,290
If it's any consolation, Lizzie,
they didn't tell me either.

148
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:36,894
So what's this big idea
of yours?

149
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,231
Gerald.

150
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:42,833
Gerald's the big idea?

151
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:44,435
He's a healer,
Archie.

152
00:07:44,436 --> 00:07:48,072
He has the most amazing
power to tap into your soul.

153
00:07:48,073 --> 00:07:50,708
Once word gets around,
we'll be fighting off

154
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:52,710
The punters
with boiling oil.

155
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:54,479
So that's why you're here,

156
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,647
You and your... hangers-on.

157
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:58,583
They're alternative
therapists.

158
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:02,086
They're qualified in aromatherapy,
reflexology, homeopathy.

159
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:03,954
I know, we could
call it the...

160
00:08:03,955 --> 00:08:07,425
The Glenbogle Home
for Gullible Hypochondriacs.

161
00:08:07,426 --> 00:08:09,227
It's a good idea.

162
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:10,894
You know it is.

163
00:08:10,895 --> 00:08:13,197
<i>You just hate it
because it was me</i>

164
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:14,865
Who came up with it.

165
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:17,301
Fine, because you're going
to end up wishing you had.

166
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:22,273
Sam, hi, it's Archie.

167
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:24,342
How is my favorite
old hippie?

168
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:27,878
No, I don't need any veg.
I need to pick your brains.

169
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:32,517
Have you ever heard of a guy
called Gerald Matthews,

170
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:34,385
Some sort
of mystical healer?

171
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:36,387
I'm sorry, dear,
are you busy?

172
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:37,888
Just take a seat
inside.

173
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:40,358
- It's nearly ready.
- I beg your pardon?

174
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,959
Are you not
with Lizzie?

175
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,428
Actually, I was
looking for Golly.

176
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:45,929
Is he all right?

177
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,065
I was expecting him
the other day, but...

178
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:50,168
He's fine
as far as I know.

179
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:52,537
Did you want to leave
a message, or...

180
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:55,105
Oh, just tell him
it was Alice.

181
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:58,042
He's supposed to be
fixing up my house.

182
00:08:58,043 --> 00:09:00,144
What, D.I.Y.
Sort of thing?

183
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:02,346
Aye, that sort of thing.

184
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:04,282
A man of many talents.

185
00:09:04,283 --> 00:09:07,017
Oh, yes...
He is.

186
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:10,621
Anyway.

187
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:12,323
I'll tell him
you called.

188
00:09:12,324 --> 00:09:14,225
Thank you,
my dear.

189
00:09:19,864 --> 00:09:23,033
Gerald:
This is an extraordinary place.

190
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:28,038
The elements...
total harmony.

191
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:31,375
The yin and the yang.

192
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:35,879
Oh yes,
I've heard of them.

193
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,349
Those two pandas
they couldn't get to breed.

194
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,885
I think you're winding me up,
aren't you, Hector?

195
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:44,422
I don't get much of a
chance to do that here.

196
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:47,191
With Archie it's like
shooting goldfish.

197
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:49,059
Uh, Archie will show
you round the estate.

198
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,428
I hope you'll make
yourselves at home.

199
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:52,129
You are very generous,
Hector.

200
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,297
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

201
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:54,732
Change of scenery
does us all good.

202
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,900
Now look after Gerald,
Archie, will you?

203
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:59,069
He's a bit concerned
about the pandas,

204
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,438
Apparently.

205
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:05,710
Girl:
Bye. See you.

206
00:10:08,913 --> 00:10:10,248
Katrina: Bye.

207
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:12,416
And don't forget it's
nature trail tomorrow.

208
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:14,051
<i>Lizzie:
Nature trail?</i>

209
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:16,554
Spreading sedition
in young minds, you mean.

210
00:10:16,555 --> 00:10:19,690
I only do that
in the classroom. Hello.

211
00:10:19,691 --> 00:10:20,658
Hi, Katrina.

212
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:24,495
You look fantastic.

213
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:26,230
How long
are you home for?

214
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:29,367
I'm not sure yet.
Ever, maybe?

215
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:30,934
Seriously?

216
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:33,304
You must have given
Archie a surprise.

217
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:35,640
He's got a few more
surprises coming.

218
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:38,342
Come on. I've got a bottle
of bubbly in the fridge

219
00:10:38,343 --> 00:10:41,111
Just waiting
for a good excuse.

220
00:10:41,112 --> 00:10:43,581
That is one sexy
set of wheels.

221
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:45,616
- Can I have a spin?
- Sure.

222
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:52,122
Goes a bit,
doesn't it?

223
00:10:52,123 --> 00:10:53,957
Hey, that's my bike!

224
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,160
After all these years,
you still fell for it!

225
00:10:56,161 --> 00:10:57,361
( laughing )

226
00:10:57,362 --> 00:10:59,029
We're not based anywhere.

227
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,864
We follow our stars.

228
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:03,768
Oh, yeah?
How did you meet Lizzie, then?

229
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:06,470
- She found me.
- She told you about Glenbogle?

230
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:08,639
No, it's what
the crystal told us.

231
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,741
I dowsed a map
of the area.

232
00:11:10,742 --> 00:11:12,976
It virtually took off.
You know this place sits

233
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:15,145
On the conjunction
of seven ley lines?

234
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:17,147
I must have missed
that one somehow.

235
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:19,483
Every lunar cycle,
this place will become

236
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:22,052
A focus for
terrestrial energy.

237
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:23,821
And at the end
of this week,

238
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:25,889
Full moon's in the house
of the sun.

239
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,659
- So you're a bit early then?
- We have to prepare.

240
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,861
It'll be
an extraordinary nexus

241
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:33,664
Of spiritual
and erotic power.

242
00:11:33,665 --> 00:11:37,234
Right. And this
alternative health center,

243
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:39,570
Is that Lizzie's idea,
or yours?

244
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:42,973
Cynicism corrodes
the soul, Archie.

245
00:11:42,974 --> 00:11:44,809
Listen, Gerald...

246
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,245
I don't mean
to be offensive, but...

247
00:11:48,246 --> 00:11:50,881
Lizzie often has
these flashes of genius,

248
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:52,883
And somehow they always
seem to burn out.

249
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:55,753
And you're worried that you'll
be left holding the ashes?

250
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:57,521
Finding ley lines is great.

251
00:11:57,522 --> 00:12:00,290
Next week's lottery numbers,
now that would be something.

252
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,292
Your father says you're
drilling for water.

253
00:12:02,293 --> 00:12:05,195
We were, but they bent
the drill bit on some turf.

254
00:12:06,565 --> 00:12:09,132
Drills violate the earth.

255
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:14,572
Mother nature prefers it
if you ask nicely.

256
00:12:21,112 --> 00:12:23,981
I'll run and fetch
a spade, shall I?

257
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:28,285
<i>Maybe if we
sacrificed a virgin?</i>

258
00:12:28,286 --> 00:12:30,120
Oh, patience,
Archie, please.

259
00:12:47,472 --> 00:12:48,706
( chuckling )

260
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:55,780
<i>( water trickling )</i>

261
00:12:58,683 --> 00:12:59,950
It's a knack...

262
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:03,654
Some people have.
( chuckles )

263
00:13:07,225 --> 00:13:09,627
<i>Katrina: Lizzie, we're
not in the Arctic Circle.</i>

264
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:12,463
<i>- I love doing this.
- Incinerating things?</i>

265
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:14,565
You make me sound
like a pyromaniac.

266
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:16,434
You were always
making bonfires,

267
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:18,135
Usually out
of your diaries.

268
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:20,771
I was always trying
to make a fresh start.

269
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:23,340
<i>- So what's he like... Gerald?
- He's extraordinary.</i>

270
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:26,176
It's like he can see
right through you.

271
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:28,278
He has this animal aura.

272
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,248
Sounds like he's more
than just a client.

273
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:32,450
Do you mind?

274
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:34,452
It's unethical to sleep
with the customers.

275
00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:37,488
"unethical?" I thought
you were in PR.

276
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:40,057
So, is there a man
in your life?

277
00:13:40,058 --> 00:13:42,993
I think I'm better off
without a man.

278
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:44,795
It's just as well,

279
00:13:44,796 --> 00:13:47,097
They're not exactly thick
on the ground round here.

280
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:49,366
Unless you count Archie,
he's thick enough.

281
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:50,734
( chuckling )

282
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:54,805
- I don't believe it.
- What?

283
00:13:54,806 --> 00:13:56,974
I mention Archie
and you go all pink.

284
00:13:56,975 --> 00:14:00,511
I'm not surprised, with that
fire you've got going there.

285
00:14:00,512 --> 00:14:02,847
I'm not the only one
with a fire going, am I?

286
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:05,616
You are deranged.

287
00:14:05,617 --> 00:14:08,385
You went that color when Andy
Collins asked you to marry him.

288
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:10,087
When I was 12!

289
00:14:10,088 --> 00:14:13,190
Katrina, it's me,
Lizzie.

290
00:14:13,191 --> 00:14:15,526
You're not fooling anyone.

291
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:17,495
Except yourself.

292
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:19,062
That's it.

293
00:14:19,063 --> 00:14:21,164
No more champagne
for you.

294
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,273
Mm.

295
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:31,742
This is lovely.

296
00:14:31,743 --> 00:14:33,276
Do you have
any lavender?

297
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:34,945
Not much call for it.

298
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:36,580
Doesn't exactly
go with grouse.

299
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:40,117
- It makes the most wonderful massage oil.
- I see.

300
00:14:40,118 --> 00:14:42,653
Round here we make do
with peanut butter.

301
00:14:43,922 --> 00:14:46,690
I'll have a look
in the gardens, thanks.

302
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:48,759
You're welcome.

303
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,828
Bubble head.

304
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,064
Hey, can I help you?

305
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:55,432
Oh, hello.

306
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:58,002
I was wondering,
is Golly around?

307
00:14:58,003 --> 00:15:01,005
He doesn't spend much time
around the big house.

308
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:04,474
So he's all right then? Only
I was a wee bit concerned.

309
00:15:04,475 --> 00:15:06,944
Why, is he doing
your D.I.Y. As well?

310
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:08,145
Pardon?

311
00:15:08,146 --> 00:15:10,648
There was a lady
looking for him yesterday.

312
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:12,683
Oh, right.

313
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:15,052
Well, he's very
capable, you know.

314
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:17,254
Good with his hands.

315
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:20,624
Would you like
to wait for him inside?

316
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,893
Och, no, I don't want
to put you out.

317
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:25,362
Oh, you're not. Kettle's
just boiled. Come on.

318
00:15:30,268 --> 00:15:32,169
<i>( sheep bleating )</i>

319
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:41,712
<i>( thuds )</i>

320
00:15:43,915 --> 00:15:45,983
I hear moses
produced a miracle.

321
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:49,419
If this is fit to drink,
it could be a miracle.

322
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,388
Golly could have
found that spring.

323
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:54,424
- He knows every watercourse for miles.
- Yeah, but Golly wasn't here.

324
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:56,627
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

325
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:58,228
Nobody's seen him
in days.

326
00:15:58,229 --> 00:16:00,530
The ladies of the locality
are worried about him.

327
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:01,765
"the ladies?"

328
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:04,334
Apparently,
they rely on Golly to,

329
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:07,671
Uh, address
their womanly needs.

330
00:16:07,672 --> 00:16:08,939
Golly?

331
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,608
Well, don't look
so shocked.

332
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:12,743
He's a ghillie,
not a monk.

333
00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:15,212
- Well, yeah, but-
- the thing is...

334
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:19,182
Lately he hasn't been
rising to the occasion.

335
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:21,652
What am I
supposed to do?

336
00:16:21,653 --> 00:16:24,287
Well, he's upset,
and he's depressed.

337
00:16:24,288 --> 00:16:25,990
He needs to talk
to someone.

338
00:16:25,991 --> 00:16:27,758
But why me?
I know nothing about it.

339
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,459
Oh, really?

340
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,428
Wouldn't you?

341
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:34,064
I'm not sure I really want to
discuss this with you, Lexie.

342
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:36,299
I don't want to discuss
it with you either,

343
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,902
But Golly needs to
discuss it with someone.

344
00:16:38,903 --> 00:16:40,638
And you're the Laird.

345
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:11,902
Oh, Golly,
thank goodness.

346
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:13,637
For a minute there
I thought I was lost.

347
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:15,939
You were lost.

348
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,841
People have been
asking after you.

349
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:20,443
I saw the weirdos
arriving.

350
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:22,412
Thought I'd better
make myself scarce.

351
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,748
<i>- Lizzie's friends.
- I know the type.</i>

352
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:26,016
<i>Nature lovers.</i>

353
00:17:26,017 --> 00:17:28,886
Should spend a few
nights in the open...

354
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:32,189
See how much nature
loves them.

355
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,857
So what have
you been up to?

356
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:37,061
Ah, I've been looking
for the stag, Big Eric.

357
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:38,796
There's something wrong.

358
00:17:38,797 --> 00:17:40,831
Should be with the hinds.

359
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:43,734
They need their sire
and he's nowhere to be seen.

360
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:48,338
Maybe he's
a little stressed.

361
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:49,940
"stressed?"

362
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:51,675
It's a vicious circle,
isn't it?

363
00:17:51,676 --> 00:17:54,277
The more he worries about
it, the worse it gets.

364
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:56,714
Maybe he should
learn to relax.

365
00:17:56,715 --> 00:17:58,615
Go with the flow,
sort of thing.

366
00:17:58,616 --> 00:18:00,383
"go with the flow?"

367
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:03,587
Are we talking about a deer,
or a fish?

368
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:07,657
Well, um...
Neither actually.

369
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:12,062
What the hell are
we talking about?

370
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:15,733
Your, uh...
Your problem.

371
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:19,436
What problem
would that be?

372
00:18:19,437 --> 00:18:21,739
Well, your-

373
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,341
The lack of, um...

374
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:27,477
- You know.
- ( gun clicks )

375
00:18:27,478 --> 00:18:31,115
You're lucky this gun
is not loaded, your lairdship.

376
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:33,283
Otherwise you'd be
picking buckshot

377
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:35,285
Out of your tiny,
skinny, aristocratic-

378
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:37,755
For goodness sake, Golly,
it's not the end of the world.

379
00:18:37,756 --> 00:18:40,958
- It happens to all of us.
- Not to me it doesn't!

380
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:46,696
Golly, wait.
You could at least

381
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:49,032
Point me in the direction of home.

382
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:51,501
You're the wildlife expert.

383
00:18:51,502 --> 00:18:53,971
You work it out.

384
00:18:57,108 --> 00:18:58,208
( sighs )

385
00:19:07,218 --> 00:19:10,320
Hey, have you
seen this?

386
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:12,189
New handbag?

387
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,391
Well, I'm glad
you think it's funny.

388
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:16,960
That well hasn't
dried up in 30 years.

389
00:19:16,961 --> 00:19:19,396
Katrina, it's the
first I've heard of it.

390
00:19:19,397 --> 00:19:21,131
That's just typical.

391
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:23,366
You totally disrupt
somebody's life,

392
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,735
And then you think if you
flutter your big brown eyes

393
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:27,304
They'll just roll over.

394
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:30,007
- Is this about your well?
- Yes, this is about my well.

395
00:19:30,008 --> 00:19:32,542
Okay, then, I'm sorry. But
if you go into your kitchen,

396
00:19:32,543 --> 00:19:34,244
You'll find these
things called taps.

397
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:36,079
That chlorinated widdle.

398
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,781
It's good enough
for the rest of us.

399
00:19:37,782 --> 00:19:40,583
Anyway, why do you
need a spring

400
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:42,752
If you're opening
an alternative health center?

401
00:19:42,753 --> 00:19:44,721
Who says I am?
Lizzie?

402
00:19:44,722 --> 00:19:46,924
Oh, come on, it's got
to be better than sticking

403
00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:49,726
A great big bottling plant
in the middle of the glen.

404
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:51,328
Unless, of course,
the Laird doesn't

405
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:54,731
Want to share his mansion
with the common ruck.

406
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:56,233
Mm-hmm.

407
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:58,101
<i>( woman giggling )</i>

408
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:05,042
I don't have time.

409
00:20:05,043 --> 00:20:06,343
( groans )

410
00:20:07,846 --> 00:20:09,446
<i>( giggling )</i>

411
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:14,017
( sighs )

412
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:17,287
<i>Molly, moaning:
Oh, yes.</i>

413
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:21,959
<i>Oh, I'm feeling tingly
all the way up.</i>

414
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:26,864
<i>Oh yes,
how do you do it?</i>

415
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:30,200
<i>Oh, how do you do it?</i>

416
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:33,270
<i>Oh, yes,
it really is so...</i>

417
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:36,373
<i>Ooh, just a little higher...</i>

418
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:38,775
<i>( moaning )
oh!</i>

419
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:41,144
<i>Oh, oh, oh,
I've never dreamed</i>

420
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:43,146
<i>It could be...</i>

421
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:44,447
All right,
what's going on?!

422
00:20:44,448 --> 00:20:49,119
Oh, it's called reflexology.
It's absolutely astounding.

423
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,355
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't stop.

424
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:53,190
I see.
Jolly good.

425
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:55,092
You should try it,
darling.

426
00:20:55,093 --> 00:20:57,060
I don't think so.

427
00:20:57,061 --> 00:20:59,829
Oh, don't be so stodgy.
Get 'em off.

428
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,064
What?

429
00:21:01,065 --> 00:21:02,465
Your shoes.

430
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:05,002
Oh!
( chuckling )

431
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,438
It really is
quite extraordinary.

432
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:10,673
I thought those chaps
just cut your toe nails.

433
00:21:10,674 --> 00:21:12,976
That's chiropody,
not reflexology.

434
00:21:12,977 --> 00:21:14,844
Ah. You know, Lizzie,

435
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:16,579
I really think
you're on to something.

436
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,283
Unfortunately
Archie's not convinced.

437
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:22,953
Archie, not even after
Gerald found that spring?

438
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:25,755
It was a trick. Like he said,
"lots of people have the knack. "

439
00:21:25,756 --> 00:21:27,690
- Anyone could have found it.
- You didn't.

440
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:29,492
How much did
that survey cost?

441
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:31,494
It's an investment.
We'll recoup it.

442
00:21:31,495 --> 00:21:33,931
<i>Lizzie: The alternative health
center wouldn't need any investment,</i>

443
00:21:33,932 --> 00:21:35,265
<i>We've got it all here.</i>

444
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:38,435
Lizzie, I'm thinking
in the long-term.

445
00:21:38,436 --> 00:21:40,137
So am I.

446
00:21:40,138 --> 00:21:42,005
I'd like to have
my baby here.

447
00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:44,441
What did she say?

448
00:21:46,444 --> 00:21:48,145
I'm pregnant, daddy.

449
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:51,415
Oh, Lizzie!

450
00:21:52,516 --> 00:21:54,284
Excellent!
Absolutely splendid!

451
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:56,753
Hear that, Archie? A grandson
to carry on the family line.

452
00:21:56,754 --> 00:21:58,455
Marvelous.
Congratulations, liz.

453
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:00,157
It might be
a granddaughter.

454
00:22:00,158 --> 00:22:02,659
Oh, yes, well. Better
than nothing, isn't it?

455
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,328
<i>- Hector.
- What?</i>

456
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:07,030
I'd like to sell
the flat in London.

457
00:22:07,031 --> 00:22:08,798
I want my child
to grow up here.

458
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,934
Oh, yes, Lizzie.
It'll be wonderful

459
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:12,469
To have a child
in the house again.

460
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,371
Absolutely.
Even a girl.

461
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:18,108
<i>Archie:
Does, uh, does Gerald know?</i>

462
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:20,210
He is the father?

463
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:23,313
Yes, he does.
He is.

464
00:22:23,314 --> 00:22:26,216
Lizzie, I know I'm
hopelessly old fashioned,

465
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:29,419
But we haven't missed
anything, have we?

466
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,888
- Like an engagement?
- Mommy.

467
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:33,590
<i>( Hector groans )</i>

468
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:35,058
I see.

469
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:38,195
Time you took matters
in hand, I think.

470
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:41,431
- What's this?
- Keys to the shotgun rack.

471
00:22:41,432 --> 00:22:43,766
Father, surely a rifle
would be more humane.

472
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:46,069
I'm talking about
family honor, damn it.

473
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,537
It's a bit late
to worry about that.

474
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:50,040
Very well.

475
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:53,410
Daddy, please
don't make a scene.

476
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:55,445
I don't intend to.

477
00:22:55,446 --> 00:22:57,381
Gerald seems
to be a gentleman.

478
00:22:57,382 --> 00:23:01,485
I shall merely remind him
of his obligations.

479
00:23:11,462 --> 00:23:13,530
Hector:
Gerald, a word with you.

480
00:23:13,531 --> 00:23:15,865
- Shh.
- It's all right.

481
00:23:20,104 --> 00:23:22,005
Meet again
this evening.

482
00:23:22,006 --> 00:23:24,941
<i>Lizzie's just told
us her good news.</i>

483
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:26,776
Oh, you must be
very proud of her.

484
00:23:26,777 --> 00:23:28,912
I understand you deserve
some of the credit.

485
00:23:28,913 --> 00:23:32,182
In which case there's probably
something you want to ask me.

486
00:23:32,183 --> 00:23:34,717
Lizzie said it
would be okay...

487
00:23:34,718 --> 00:23:36,619
To use the library.

488
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,222
"library?"

489
00:23:39,223 --> 00:23:42,192
For our healing session tonight.
You're welcome to join us.

490
00:23:42,193 --> 00:23:44,661
That's not what I meant.

491
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:47,497
You're so lucky.

492
00:23:47,498 --> 00:23:50,934
This landscape just keeps
the spirit in balance.

493
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:53,136
I hear you don't swim
in the loch any longer?

494
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:54,804
Used to...

495
00:23:54,805 --> 00:23:57,174
Every day...
Once upon a time.

496
00:23:57,175 --> 00:23:59,543
Why did you stop?

497
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:01,078
Got old.

498
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,613
Do you ever think
that perhaps

499
00:24:03,614 --> 00:24:05,382
You got old
because you stopped?

500
00:24:08,086 --> 00:24:10,187
We'll be starting
at 7:00, okay?

501
00:24:10,188 --> 00:24:12,021
Right-o.

502
00:24:12,022 --> 00:24:14,257
I- hold on!

503
00:24:15,926 --> 00:24:18,061
( telephone ringing )

504
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:23,300
Glenbogle Refuge
for New Age Dropouts.

505
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:26,136
Hold on.
Uh, Archie-

506
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:28,037
Your favorite
old hippie.

507
00:24:29,907 --> 00:24:31,141
Hello?

508
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:34,444
<i>Janice: I feel the need for approval.</i>

509
00:24:34,445 --> 00:24:37,314
That's why I'm always
throwing myself at people.

510
00:24:37,315 --> 00:24:39,682
And you hope that Duncan
will catch you?

511
00:24:41,586 --> 00:24:44,087
- Oh, sorry.
- No, no. Please, come in.

512
00:24:44,088 --> 00:24:47,357
<i>- I was looking for Lizzie.
- She's coming later.</i>

513
00:24:47,358 --> 00:24:49,359
Please, take a seat.

514
00:24:53,164 --> 00:24:54,397
All right.

515
00:24:58,836 --> 00:25:01,438
We were just...

516
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:03,740
Looking at events
that shape our lives.

517
00:25:06,444 --> 00:25:09,546
Talking purges
the spirit.

518
00:25:09,547 --> 00:25:10,947
Ah, right.

519
00:25:10,948 --> 00:25:13,016
Colonic irrigation
for the soul.

520
00:25:13,017 --> 00:25:15,084
( people chuckling )

521
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:16,353
We can't...

522
00:25:16,354 --> 00:25:19,256
Bury the pain
in our hearts.

523
00:25:19,257 --> 00:25:21,158
No, absolutely.

524
00:25:22,793 --> 00:25:26,196
Is there anything that
you would like to share?

525
00:25:27,465 --> 00:25:29,899
Uh... Nope.

526
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,969
Nothing I can
think of, sorry.

527
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,606
What about what
you can't think of?

528
00:25:38,008 --> 00:25:39,909
<i>Your brother...</i>

529
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,078
<i>Jamie?</i>

530
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,680
What?

531
00:25:45,115 --> 00:25:48,385
<i>The boating accident
on the loch?</i>

532
00:25:48,386 --> 00:25:51,921
<i>When Jamie drowned.</i>

533
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:57,994
I know you must feel
terrible guilt.

534
00:26:00,931 --> 00:26:03,032
You know
nothing of the sort.

535
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:06,236
Excuse me.

536
00:26:09,106 --> 00:26:12,509
Archie, there is
no healing in denial.

537
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,077
<i>( door closes )</i>

538
00:26:15,646 --> 00:26:17,914
Lizzie, have you got a minute?
I don't care who

539
00:26:17,915 --> 00:26:20,550
You and Gerald try to fool,
but leave the family out of it.

540
00:26:20,551 --> 00:26:22,285
- Okay?
- What's the matter?

541
00:26:22,286 --> 00:26:24,654
He's been interrogating me
about Jamie, for one thing.

542
00:26:24,655 --> 00:26:27,123
It happened to me,
too, Archie.

543
00:26:27,124 --> 00:26:29,326
But no, it just
has to be about you.

544
00:26:29,327 --> 00:26:30,727
<i>What?</i>

545
00:26:30,728 --> 00:26:33,230
After Jamie died, it was
like I didn't exist.

546
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:36,032
<i>Everyone was so worried
about poor wee Archie.</i>

547
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:38,034
<i>You got all Hector's
affection.</i>

548
00:26:38,035 --> 00:26:40,903
- What affection? - Then when things
go wrong, who do they ask for?

549
00:26:40,904 --> 00:26:43,806
Wee Archie, who never gave
them a thought since he left.

550
00:26:43,807 --> 00:26:46,276
I'm older than you,
no one ever asked me.

551
00:26:46,277 --> 00:26:47,977
Because the best
you can come up with is

552
00:26:47,978 --> 00:26:50,880
Some failed double glazing salesman
who's masquerading as a guru.

553
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:52,549
You've been checking up
on Gerald?

554
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,051
Of course I have.
He's an undischarged bankrupt.

555
00:26:55,052 --> 00:26:56,986
For goodness sake, Archie,
I could have told you that

556
00:26:56,987 --> 00:26:59,356
- If you'd asked me.
- You mean you knew?

557
00:26:59,357 --> 00:27:02,626
Gerald's abilities are real.
You've seen them.

558
00:27:02,627 --> 00:27:03,826
<i>( hawk screeching )</i>

559
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:10,867
Is that what
it looks like?

560
00:27:10,868 --> 00:27:13,035
What does
it look like?

561
00:27:13,036 --> 00:27:15,705
Like you're hard
on poachers.

562
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:17,540
I'm building
a new hide.

563
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:19,809
- I'm Gerald.
- I know who you are.

564
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,844
Did you wanna hand?

565
00:27:21,845 --> 00:27:24,147
( groaning )
I'm not entirely useless.

566
00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:25,415
Yet.

567
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:29,619
Lonely up here.

568
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,822
Solitary.
Not the same thing.

569
00:27:32,823 --> 00:27:35,057
All the same.

570
00:27:37,861 --> 00:27:41,063
There's no one
to see your pain.

571
00:27:41,064 --> 00:27:43,533
Who says
I'm in pain?

572
00:27:43,534 --> 00:27:46,102
You know, the South American
Indians believe that...

573
00:27:46,103 --> 00:27:48,271
<i>We each of us
have a spirit animal.</i>

574
00:27:48,272 --> 00:27:51,174
- Uh-huh.
- Mine's the salmon.

575
00:27:52,443 --> 00:27:56,078
I'm Church of Scotland,
myself.

576
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:58,181
Yours will be the stag.

577
00:27:59,817 --> 00:28:01,884
There are
no stags round here.

578
00:28:01,885 --> 00:28:04,554
Well, when there are...

579
00:28:04,555 --> 00:28:06,656
You'll start to feel better.

580
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,761
Easy on the poachers, eh?

581
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,311
( inhaling deeply )

582
00:28:31,515 --> 00:28:33,416
( flippers squeaking )

583
00:28:36,954 --> 00:28:39,055
There's an osprey
nesting nearby.

584
00:28:39,056 --> 00:28:41,090
She hunts on that stretch
of water just there.

585
00:28:41,091 --> 00:28:43,827
Amazing.

586
00:28:43,828 --> 00:28:45,895
When she dives
for a fish,

587
00:28:45,896 --> 00:28:47,731
It will take
your breath away.

588
00:28:47,732 --> 00:28:50,199
Duncan, you know
I said I was

589
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,201
Into the birds
and the bees?

590
00:28:52,202 --> 00:28:55,372
Oh, yeah, the hives, they're just
a wee bit further up the glen.

591
00:28:55,373 --> 00:28:58,675
- This isn't quite what I meant.
- What?

592
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:04,013
- What's the matter?
- ( stammering ) nothing.

593
00:29:04,014 --> 00:29:07,817
I just feel a wee bit...
Exposed, you know?

594
00:29:07,818 --> 00:29:10,720
You think there's a wild cat
out there stalking us?

595
00:29:12,022 --> 00:29:14,323
<i>- ( both chuckling )

596
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:17,460
What?

597
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:20,630
Oi!

598
00:29:20,631 --> 00:29:22,098
Lexie: Holy-

599
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:24,300
You nearly scared
the life out of me there.

600
00:29:24,301 --> 00:29:27,336
<i>- Lexie, what are you after?
- Mushrooms.</i>

601
00:29:27,337 --> 00:29:29,572
No need to ask
what you're after.

602
00:29:29,573 --> 00:29:32,008
We haven't got very far, if
that's what's bothering you.

603
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:34,110
Why should I
be bothered?

604
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:37,046
35,000 acres and you're
picking mushrooms round here?

605
00:29:37,047 --> 00:29:39,549
Look, if you two have
got something going,

606
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,317
I'd really like
to know about it.

607
00:29:41,318 --> 00:29:43,219
You've been on the mushrooms
yourself, pet.

608
00:29:44,455 --> 00:29:45,855
Well?

609
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,225
<i>Hector:

Who's that?

615
00:30:05,342 --> 00:30:08,177
- Help! Help me!
- Oh, no.

616
00:30:16,286 --> 00:30:18,187
Get help, Lexie!

617
00:30:26,163 --> 00:30:27,964

619
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:39,476
I swam that loch every day
when I was younger.

620
00:30:39,477 --> 00:30:41,978
- You're not younger any more.
- Nonsense. All in the mind.

621
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:43,947
Lexie: There's a fair
bit in your lungs as well.

622
00:30:43,948 --> 00:30:45,949
I got cramped-
the way you cook,

623
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,217
It's lucky I could float,
never mind swim. Drink!

624
00:30:48,218 --> 00:30:50,086
Oh no, no.
Help me get him upstairs.

625
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:52,622
- I don't want any help!
- You'll take it whether you want it or not,

626
00:30:52,623 --> 00:30:55,458
- You silly old goose.
- ( Hector grumbling )

627
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,731
Archie, I am so sorry.

628
00:31:01,732 --> 00:31:03,900
I had no idea he'd
take me so literally.

629
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:05,902
I've had just about
enough of this.

630
00:31:05,903 --> 00:31:07,804
It's time you and
your friends left.

631
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:10,607
<i>- No, Archie!
- Lizzie, what else does he have to do?</i>

632
00:31:10,608 --> 00:31:12,809
You can't blame Gerald
for Hector's behavior.

633
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,578
Father is sensitive about
his age and his health.

634
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:18,180
Gerald knew that. But
that's your trick, isn't it?

635
00:31:18,181 --> 00:31:21,017
- Finding people's weak points.
- Oh, for goodness sake, Archie.

636
00:31:21,018 --> 00:31:23,119
You might fool everyone else,
but you don't fool me.

637
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,221
<i>This is my home
as much as yours.</i>

638
00:31:25,222 --> 00:31:28,024
- Lizzie!
- I say he stays.

639
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:29,626
Come on, Gerald.

640
00:31:37,968 --> 00:31:39,869
<i>( doors closing )</i>

641
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:43,472
<i>Lizzie: It drives me insane, the
way he lords it over everyone.</i>

642
00:31:43,473 --> 00:31:45,575
<i>I'd like to burn
that stupid house down</i>

643
00:31:45,576 --> 00:31:47,343
<i>Just to see
the look on his face.</i>

644
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:49,879
Come on, Lizzie, don't you
think he might have a point?

645
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,548
Gerald gives people advice.

646
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:54,751
How they act on it
isn't his problem.

647
00:31:54,752 --> 00:31:57,754
- Have you got a light?
- What about the baby?

648
00:31:57,755 --> 00:32:01,157
Katrina, it's bad enough
when Archie pretends to be

649
00:32:01,158 --> 00:32:04,027
Everyone's guardian angel,
the sanctimonious creep.

650
00:32:09,232 --> 00:32:11,133
( snoring )
651
00:32:15,238 --> 00:32:17,807
- Ahem!
- Hmm-

652
00:32:17,808 --> 00:32:19,542
Now what?

653
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:21,578
Can't a man
even have 40 winks?

654
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:23,412
Not in the bath.

655
00:32:23,413 --> 00:32:25,582
Not unless you really
do want to drown yourself.

656
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:27,984
( growls )

657
00:32:27,985 --> 00:32:30,720
Are you sure you
won't see that doctor?

658
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:32,922
Perhaps you should.
You look like death.

659
00:32:32,923 --> 00:32:34,323
Well, I've had
a bit of a shock.

660
00:32:34,324 --> 00:32:38,094
Oh, I'd no idea I'd raised
such a delicate flower.

661
00:32:38,095 --> 00:32:39,762
Fine.

662
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:43,666
And next time Gerald
suggests hydrotherapy,

663
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:46,135
Let me know, okay?

664
00:32:46,136 --> 00:32:48,972
<i>I don't need a second opinion,
thank you very much.</i>

665
00:32:48,973 --> 00:32:50,707
Young Gerald
has a lot more sense

666
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:52,374
Than some people I know.

667
00:32:57,214 --> 00:32:59,649
I'll say it for him,
"thank you. "

668
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,918
And I'm sorry he
put you through this.

669
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,520
It's not his fault.
Gerald is the liability.

670
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:06,388
But he meant well.

671
00:33:06,389 --> 00:33:08,725
And he makes
Lizzie so happy.

672
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:10,359
Hmm.

why wouldn't I be staying on?

691
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,328
You'll have to speak to Lizzie
about that one, I'm afraid.

692
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:55,798
<i>- Archie- - I'm handing
it all over to Lizzie.</i>

693
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:59,068
She's got a big idea,
she's got a baby on the way,

694
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:01,303
She's got Gerald.
And everyone else

695
00:35:01,304 --> 00:35:03,840
Seems to think the sun shines
out of his armpits, so...

696
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:06,375
What about your duty
to your tenants?

697
00:35:06,376 --> 00:35:08,510
Your loyalty
to your clan?

698
00:35:08,511 --> 00:35:11,480
All those traditions
you're supposed to uphold?

699
00:35:11,481 --> 00:35:13,582
( scoffs ) Katrina,
can you hear yourself?

700
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:17,153
Well, I know
it's all nonsense, but...

701
00:35:17,154 --> 00:35:19,789
You can't just-
walk out.

702
00:35:21,324 --> 00:35:22,992
Watch me.

703
00:35:28,098 --> 00:35:29,732
Lizzie, Gerald, hi.

704
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:31,567
Here are
the accounts books.

705
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:33,369
Katrina can help you
with any queries.

706
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,938
Correspondence from the bank,
all pretty self-explanatory.

707
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:37,940
The estate records
are all filed properly,

708
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:39,942
So you shouldn't have
any trouble managing.

709
00:35:39,943 --> 00:35:42,078
- Managing what?
- The estate.

710
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,080
Your healing center's
a wonderful idea.

711
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:45,648
You don't really
believe that.

712
00:35:45,649 --> 00:35:47,316
It doesn't matter
what I believe.

713
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:49,819
I wish you all the best,
and I hope it's a huge success.

714
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,420
Where are you going?

715
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:54,456
Back to London. Packing today,
leaving tomorrow first thing.

716
00:35:54,457 --> 00:35:56,525
It's all yours.

717
00:35:56,526 --> 00:36:00,129
What's all this nonsense about you
leaving? You've got responsibilities.

718
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,864
I don't want them.
I never have.

719
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:04,000
If Lizzie does,
she's welcome to them.

720
00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:06,769
She wants to do things her way and
you prefer her way to mine, so...

721
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,205
Don't ask us to choose
between the two of you.

722
00:36:09,206 --> 00:36:12,175
I'd never do that.
I don't wanna hear the answer.

723
00:36:14,144 --> 00:36:16,813
I'm not forcing him
to leave, Katrina.

724
00:36:16,814 --> 00:36:18,981
Even when you announced
you were pregnant,

725
00:36:18,982 --> 00:36:21,684
- And moving back home?
- It's a big house.

726
00:36:21,685 --> 00:36:23,585
There's plenty of room
for all of us.

727
00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:27,023
There's a couple
of things missing

728
00:36:27,024 --> 00:36:28,925
From my bathroom cabinet.

729
00:36:30,593 --> 00:36:32,829
I'm sorry,
I'll buy you some more.

730
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,131
That's not the point.

731
00:36:35,132 --> 00:36:38,467
Pregnant women usually
don't need them.

732
00:36:38,468 --> 00:36:41,470
I can't believe you'd lie
about something like that

733
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:44,573
- Just to spite Archie.
- I didn't.

734
00:36:44,574 --> 00:36:46,809
I swear, I didn't.

735
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,811
It was
an honest mistake.

736
00:36:48,812 --> 00:36:51,314
I just...
Jumped the gun.

737
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,617
I want a baby.

738
00:36:55,618 --> 00:36:57,419
I love Gerald.

739
00:36:58,488 --> 00:37:00,656
And I'm sick of
postponing my life

740
00:37:00,657 --> 00:37:02,658
For the sake of
my so-called career.

741
00:37:05,462 --> 00:37:08,264
Are you going
to tell your parents?

742
00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:10,900
There'll be
other chances.

743
00:37:10,901 --> 00:37:13,302
Are you going
to tell Archie?

744
00:37:13,303 --> 00:37:15,537
Are you?

745
00:37:15,538 --> 00:37:17,740
He'll still leave,
Katrina.

746
00:37:17,741 --> 00:37:20,576
He's too stubborn
to change his mind.

747
00:37:20,577 --> 00:37:23,445
And is that
what you want?

748
00:37:23,446 --> 00:37:26,282
I want what's best
for Glenbogle.

749
00:37:26,283 --> 00:37:29,551
Archie's not the only one
who loves this place.

750
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,164
<i>( zipper zipping )</i>

751
00:37:56,113 --> 00:37:58,014
<i>( bells tinkling )</i>

752
00:38:33,883 --> 00:38:35,784
<i>( cat meowing )</i>

753
00:38:37,254 --> 00:38:39,055
There you go,
Angus.

754
00:38:47,464 --> 00:38:49,465
<i>( gate opening )</i>

755
00:38:49,466 --> 00:38:51,367
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

756
00:39:18,195 --> 00:39:20,262
<i>Lizzie: I'm not sure it's gonna happen.</i>

757
00:39:20,263 --> 00:39:23,799
We'll never get on.

758
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,234
Well...

759
00:39:25,235 --> 00:39:27,336
You're a fire child,

760
00:39:27,337 --> 00:39:29,638
And Archie's earth.

761
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:31,440
I thought
he was hot air.

762
00:39:31,441 --> 00:39:33,342
No, that's your dad.

763
00:39:35,278 --> 00:39:37,746
There's something
I've got to tell you.

764
00:39:37,747 --> 00:39:39,115
Oh, shh.

765
00:39:41,584 --> 00:39:43,419
Listen to the moon.

766
00:39:57,167 --> 00:39:59,168
If you're heading
for London,

767
00:39:59,169 --> 00:40:01,003
It's the other
direction.

768
00:40:01,004 --> 00:40:03,906
- How did you find me?
- I wasn't looking for you.

769
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:06,175
You've got
to speak to Lizzie.

770
00:40:06,176 --> 00:40:08,210
There's nothing to say.

771
00:40:08,211 --> 00:40:10,312
She can't stand
the sight of me.

772
00:40:10,313 --> 00:40:12,781
- That's not true.
- Well, it's mutual, anyway.

773
00:40:12,782 --> 00:40:15,451
She's so scatty and dizzy
and full of energy.

774
00:40:15,452 --> 00:40:18,254
And she's your sister
and you love her.

775
00:40:18,255 --> 00:40:21,057
- Talk to her, Archie.
- I can't.

776
00:40:21,058 --> 00:40:23,959
Every time I see her,
I think of when

777
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,028
The three of us were kids.

778
00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:28,264
Is that why she
makes you so angry?

779
00:40:28,265 --> 00:40:30,466
Because she reminds
you of Jamie?

780
00:40:30,467 --> 00:40:33,302
Don't,
you sound like Gerald.

781
00:40:33,303 --> 00:40:35,204
<i>Maybe you should
listen to him.</i>

782
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:37,639
Oh, please,
all that twaddle about

783
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,608
The erotic power
of the moon.

784
00:40:47,451 --> 00:40:50,252
I suppose
this is goodbye.

785
00:40:51,955 --> 00:40:54,656
You'll be coming down to London
sometime, will you?

786
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:57,193
No.

787
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,764
Right.
Well, then...

788
00:41:07,036 --> 00:41:08,937
Goodbye.

789
00:41:14,978 --> 00:41:17,279
Bloody hell,
it's dark out here.

790
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,014
- Did you bring a torch?
- No.

791
00:41:19,015 --> 00:41:20,949
- What are you like?
- Well, have you?

792
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,918
Here, take my hand.

793
00:41:22,919 --> 00:41:24,553
Stay close.

794
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:46,242
Duncan!

795
00:41:48,345 --> 00:41:49,978
You creep!

796
00:42:06,596 --> 00:42:09,198
<i>- What are you looking for?
- I'll give you a clue.</i>

797
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:12,168
It's not mushrooms.

798
00:42:12,169 --> 00:42:13,402
<i>( door slams )</i>

799
00:42:15,004 --> 00:42:17,005
( groaning )

800
00:42:18,107 --> 00:42:20,376
Perhaps it's better
if he does go.

801
00:42:20,377 --> 00:42:22,611
If he can't stand the heat,
he should get out of Scotland.

802
00:42:22,612 --> 00:42:25,214
- Quite right, dear.
- Oh, don't talk nonsense.

803
00:42:25,215 --> 00:42:27,449
Can't we lock him in his
room till he calms down?

804
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,552
We'll just have
to let them slug it out.

805
00:42:29,553 --> 00:42:32,388
<i>- ( pots banging, moaning )
- sounds like they're at it already.</i>

806
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:34,456
God almighty, it's like
trying to sleep in a brothel.

807
00:42:34,457 --> 00:42:35,857
Mm, 'tis, isn't it?

808
00:42:35,858 --> 00:42:37,693
<i>- Duncan!
- What?</i>

809
00:42:37,694 --> 00:42:39,662
I've brought you
a nice milky drink.

810
00:42:39,663 --> 00:42:41,630
I don't want
a nice milky drink

811
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:43,832
Unless it's got
whiskey in it.

812
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:48,704
Oh, there must be something
we can do to help you sleep.

813
00:42:56,846 --> 00:42:58,080
Hello?

814
00:42:58,081 --> 00:42:59,815
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

815
00:43:14,431 --> 00:43:16,332
<i>( Golly whistling )</i>

816
00:43:17,634 --> 00:43:19,535
<i>( whistling continues )</i>

817
00:43:23,806 --> 00:43:25,608
Archie.

818
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:27,843
- Fine day for a journey.
- You look a bit happier.

819
00:43:27,844 --> 00:43:29,345
Oh, I am, I am.

820
00:43:29,346 --> 00:43:31,580
I'm less... stressed.

821
00:43:31,581 --> 00:43:34,383
Ah, so Big Eric's
back in town?

822
00:43:34,384 --> 00:43:36,818
Mm. And that Gerald,
though,

823
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:39,154
He has his head
screwed on...

824
00:43:40,323 --> 00:43:42,291
For a weirdo.

825
00:43:42,292 --> 00:43:44,293
- Mm.
- Mm.

826
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,900
Great.
Rub it in.

827
00:43:59,876 --> 00:44:02,544
Away and shoot
a small-brained animal...

828
00:44:02,545 --> 00:44:04,747
Preferably yourself.

829
00:44:04,748 --> 00:44:07,182
You can't pretend
last night didn't happen.

830
00:44:07,183 --> 00:44:09,318
Last night you pushed me
on the kitchen table

831
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:10,886
And stuck your tongue
in my ear.

832
00:44:10,887 --> 00:44:12,621
It doesn't mean
we're betrothed.

833
00:44:12,622 --> 00:44:15,758
There's more to it than that,
and I think you know it.

834
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:19,194
Here... Go make up
with wee Janice.

835
00:44:35,345 --> 00:44:37,446
Oh, Duncan, will
you bring the car round?

836
00:44:37,447 --> 00:44:39,981
- Yeah, sure, boss.
- Thanks.

837
00:44:39,982 --> 00:44:42,384
Morning all, and what
a splendid morning it is.

838
00:44:42,385 --> 00:44:44,286
Father, I know
you're upset, but-

839
00:44:44,287 --> 00:44:46,522
About what?
Oh, yes, your abdication!

840
00:44:46,523 --> 00:44:48,757
I think
I'll get over it.

841
00:44:48,758 --> 00:44:51,560
Lexie, a large plate
of your finest cinders.

842
00:44:53,062 --> 00:44:55,831
Archie, were those your bags
out in the hall?

843
00:44:55,832 --> 00:44:58,334
- Sorry, are they in the way?
- Not any more.

844
00:44:58,335 --> 00:45:00,469
I told Duncan to take
them back upstairs.

845
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:03,339
- Lizzie.
- Just listen to me for once.

846
00:45:04,774 --> 00:45:07,108
I made a mistake.

847
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:09,277
I'm not having a baby.

848
00:45:09,278 --> 00:45:10,579
Not yet.

849
00:45:11,681 --> 00:45:13,181
Oh, Lizzie.

850
00:45:15,151 --> 00:45:17,586
I thought I was.

851
00:45:17,587 --> 00:45:19,655
Well, part of me did.

852
00:45:19,656 --> 00:45:22,991
And part of me just wanted
to get one over on Archie.

853
00:45:22,992 --> 00:45:25,361
And that's no way
to start a new life.

854
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,197
I'm sorry.

855
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,468
Oh, well.

856
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:34,870
Ball back in your court,
old man.

857
00:45:41,344 --> 00:45:42,911
<i>( door closing )</i>

858
00:45:46,416 --> 00:45:48,950
Liz...
Come on.

859
00:45:54,557 --> 00:45:56,692
You can try again.

860
00:45:56,693 --> 00:45:58,727
Don't leave, Archie.

861
00:45:58,728 --> 00:46:01,062
You're the one
to save this place.

862
00:46:01,063 --> 00:46:03,565
I can never stick
at anything long enough.

863
00:46:03,566 --> 00:46:05,701
I'm sorry
I wouldn't listen,

864
00:46:05,702 --> 00:46:08,670
It was just
pig-headed vanity.

865
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:10,338
Your center's
a great idea.

866
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:12,340
But it needs
thinking through.

867
00:46:12,341 --> 00:46:14,676
Not my specialty.

868
00:46:14,677 --> 00:46:18,346
You have to stay.
Mommy and daddy need you.

869
00:46:18,347 --> 00:46:20,716
And one deluded local.

870
00:46:20,717 --> 00:46:22,350
Who?

871
00:46:23,453 --> 00:46:25,320
That's my wee brother.

872
00:46:25,321 --> 00:46:27,790
Can't see what's
under his nose.

873
00:46:29,426 --> 00:46:32,260
Molly: Dear child,
take care of yourself.

874
00:46:32,261 --> 00:46:34,563
It's been so lovely
having you to stay.

875
00:46:34,564 --> 00:46:36,498
Archie: Lizzie, you
don't have to rush off.

876
00:46:36,499 --> 00:46:39,301
I'd better get back
before they sell the flat.

877
00:46:39,302 --> 00:46:41,336
Well, we're here
whenever you need us.

878
00:46:41,337 --> 00:46:43,138
I'm here.

879
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:44,706
I know.

880
00:46:45,842 --> 00:46:47,576
I was too hard
on Gerald.

881
00:46:47,577 --> 00:46:51,313
He's, uh...
He's different.

882
00:46:51,314 --> 00:46:53,315
He is,
isn't he?

883
00:46:53,316 --> 00:46:56,351
And if you ever need these
windows replacing, he's your man.

884
00:46:56,352 --> 00:46:58,053
- Anyway...
- Good luck.

885
00:47:01,591 --> 00:47:02,991
Bye, mom.

886
00:47:02,992 --> 00:47:05,060
Oh, Lizzie darling.

887
00:47:08,064 --> 00:47:09,965
Ah, bye,
Lizzie.

888
00:47:14,203 --> 00:47:16,104
- Have a good trip.
- Bye.

889
00:47:31,988 --> 00:47:35,423
I know, I could run a hose pipe to
the well and fill it with tap water.

890
00:47:35,424 --> 00:47:38,660
What do you want me to do?
Bung a big cork in the spring?

891
00:47:38,661 --> 00:47:40,195
Golly?

892
00:47:43,366 --> 00:47:44,600
Is it okay?

893
00:47:44,601 --> 00:47:48,336
Scree-fall up the glen
diverted the burn.

894
00:47:48,337 --> 00:47:51,373
I cleared it the other day.
Water table's back up.

895
00:47:51,374 --> 00:47:53,642
So it had nothing
to do with the spring?

896
00:47:53,643 --> 00:47:57,345
Water rarely runs
uphill, Archie.

897
00:47:57,346 --> 00:47:59,314
Thanks for the drink.

898
00:48:00,817 --> 00:48:03,552
If you're still looking
for a bottling plant,

899
00:48:03,553 --> 00:48:06,588
- I know one going cheap.
- Where?

900
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:09,625
Put it this way,
what's in it for me?

901
00:48:10,894 --> 00:48:12,628
Katrina, where?
Tell me.

902
00:48:12,629 --> 00:48:14,696
- Might do.
- No, seriously.

903
00:48:14,697 --> 00:48:17,298
- Ask nicely.
- Katrina, please, will you just tell me?

904
00:48:17,299 --> 00:48:19,034
Ooh, getting
desperate now.

905
00:48:21,571 --> 00:48:24,472
