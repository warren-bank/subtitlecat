1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,268
The best time
of the day, laddie.

2
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:23,604
You miss him,
don't you?

3
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:26,875
Yeah.

4
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:29,177
I can't believe
he's gone myself.

5
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:31,346
<i>Well, we're going to
have to face up to it...</i>

6
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:33,848
starting today.

7
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:36,150
I'm going to advertise
for a replacement.

8
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:38,452
It's not been
that long since he went.

9
00:00:38,453 --> 00:00:42,423
- It's been long enough.
- You could get in touch with his daughter again,

10
00:00:42,424 --> 00:00:45,360
<i>- see if she's heard anything yet.
- no, my mind's made up.</i>

11
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:47,896
We can't run this place
if we're short-staffed.

12
00:00:50,665 --> 00:00:52,867
Come on,
let's go back to bed.

13
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:56,670
That's it then?
No more Golly at Glenbogle?

14
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,074
<i>It was his decision, Lex.
He was the one who left.</i>

15
00:01:13,622 --> 00:01:15,589
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

16
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:52,326
Are you sure this is the right
time to be taking on someone new?

17
00:01:52,327 --> 00:01:54,595
We can't exactly offer them
job security, can we?

18
00:01:54,596 --> 00:01:56,797
We can't afford
to think like that.

19
00:01:56,798 --> 00:01:59,066
If we're going to have
any chance at all

20
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,901
we need to be
properly staffed.

21
00:02:00,902 --> 00:02:03,303
I'm going
to write out the ad,

22
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:05,840
but you'll have
to send them a check.

23
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:08,876
Fine, just put it on top
of my to-do pile.

24
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:12,346
You've got a to-do pile?

25
00:02:12,347 --> 00:02:15,249
- That's very organized.
- Don't sound so surprised.

26
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,685
That's why you put me
in charge of accounts.

27
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,887
<i>Mmm, one of my better
decisions, I think.</i>

28
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:22,923
You know,
today might be a good time

29
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:25,092
to have a look
at the books.

30
00:02:28,797 --> 00:02:31,599
- Morning.
- Morning.

31
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:39,907
Fresh baked bread-

32
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:42,410
Golly's favorite.

33
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:44,578
He wouldn't eat
anything else.
34
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:47,915
Yeah, he thought it was the
best thing since... sliced bread.

35
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,050
Pass me that flour,
will you?

36
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:53,521
Thanks.

37
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:55,389
The real trick
is in the kneading.

38
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,957
You've really got
to go for it.

39
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,092
You know, work the dough
through with your hands.

40
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:00,728
You want to try?

41
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:10,938
Don't just
tickle it, Duncan.

42
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:16,577
( groaning )

43
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:18,512
Feels good,
doesn't it?

44
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:39,132
<i>( crashes, Irene laughing )</i>

45
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:42,703
Oh!

46
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:46,173
Hi, h-hi, hello.

47
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:47,942
There it is.

48
00:03:47,943 --> 00:03:50,410
<i>Duncan, dear, when you
finish with the stepladder</i>

49
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:53,948
- bring it into the hall for me, would you?
- Aye, right.

50
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:55,816
Okay, Molly.

51
00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:58,486
Oh, Irene, I know you don't
like having things sprung on you

52
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:01,355
at the last minute, so I thought
I'd give you a bit of warning.

53
00:04:01,356 --> 00:04:03,924
We've got a visitor tomorrow-
an art dealer from Glasgow.

54
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:07,427
- Great.
- Right.

55
00:04:07,428 --> 00:04:10,798
Fine. well, I thought you'd
like to make a nice lunch.

56
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,600
Brilliant idea.
Anything else?

57
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:15,068
No, nothing at all.

58
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:16,604
I'm going to rearrange

59
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:18,772
<i>the paintings in the hall
I think.</i>

60
00:04:18,773 --> 00:04:21,909
Want him to see the place
in the best possible light.

61
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,444
Another brilliant idea.

62
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:27,280
Yes.
Well, I'll...

63
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:29,149
leave you
to your baking.

64
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,052
Duncan, if you are going
to give Irene a helping hand,

65
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:34,087
you really ought
to be more careful.

66
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:40,761
Right. Got it.
Thanks, Molly.

67
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:46,767
( both sigh )

68
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:49,937
I thought she was onto us
there for a moment.

69
00:05:03,685 --> 00:05:05,920
- Problem?
- No, no.

70
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:08,288
You've obviously got
some sort of system here.

71
00:05:10,324 --> 00:05:13,060
- Correct. and?
- Nothing, nothing.

72
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:15,328
I've got every
confidence in you.

73
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:17,531
Glad to hear it. Is that
a copy of the ad you want?

74
00:05:17,532 --> 00:05:20,568
- Yep.
- Fine, just leave it with me.

75
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:23,336
Okay,
have a nice day.

76
00:05:23,337 --> 00:05:26,206
Listen, since I'm here I might
as well have a look at the books.

77
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:28,241
<i>Ahh
- no offense, Arch, but you wouldn't have</i>

78
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:30,911
a scoobie what's going on
here. I'll do you a printout,

79
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:33,180
a breakdown, so you'll
know where we stand.

80
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:36,116
- Great.
- Okay, then.

81
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:39,587
I'll leave you to it.

82
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:41,989
Probably the best bet.
It is my job after all.

83
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,091
Now, come on.
You have to get ready

84
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:46,794
for the school party
and I'll crack on here.

85
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:11,218
( groans )

86
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,761
Not avoiding me,
are you, Irene?

87
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:23,931
Me?
No, no.

88
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:26,000
In fact, I've got
something for you.

89
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:28,568
'Cause I thought
you might be embarrassed-

90
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,470
not that
you should be.

91
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:33,340
I think it's marvelous.
An inspiration, in fact.

92
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:35,676
You left this behind
at breakfast.

93
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:37,845
"The annual gathering
of the highland society

94
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:39,880
for the appreciation
of modern culture. "

95
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:43,083
- Sounds like a good party.
- Oh, not just any party.

96
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:45,485
In the '60s, we'd have
called it a happening.

97
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:49,589
As much as I miss
my darling Hector,

98
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,526
it'll be nice to stay longer
than five minutes for a change.

99
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:56,030
- Well, you have a good time.
- Yes, I suppose I shall.

100
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:59,833
In fact, I might find
a toy boy of my own.

101
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:04,504
Boys and girls, we want you
have a good time here today,

102
00:07:04,505 --> 00:07:06,540
but we also want you
to be safe.

103
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,475
So you need
to stay in your groups

104
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:10,343
follow the signs
and always,

105
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:12,646
always stick
to the trails, okay?

106
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:14,782
Now, have you all got
your booklets?

107
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:16,950
( laughing )

108
00:07:18,987 --> 00:07:21,454
<i>Boy:
Got you on the head.</i>

109
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:23,590
If you do get into
any difficulties,

110
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:26,960
speak into this and someone
will come and give you a hand.

111
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:29,063
<i>( sizzling )</i>

112
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:37,237
Something smells good.

113
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:39,506
French onion soup.

114
00:07:39,507 --> 00:07:41,408
Much as we all miss Golly,

115
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:43,443
it is nice to be able
to cook something

116
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:46,246
that didn't have to be
caught or shot on the estate.

117
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:49,349
Duncan, Golly's not dead.
We're not being disloyal

118
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,285
to his memory if we have
a little joke now and then.

119
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:56,123
- I know.
- Okay then.

120
00:07:56,124 --> 00:08:00,060
Anyway, aren't there some advantages to
having one less person hanging around?

121
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:02,930
Privacy for starters.

122
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:05,532
Privacy, aye.

123
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,968
Privacy's
a good thing, Duncan.

124
00:08:12,073 --> 00:08:14,674
<i>- ( whistling )
- why are you whistling?</i>

125
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:17,845
Whistling, me?
Just happy.

126
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:20,147
Keep spreading
that sunshine.

127
00:08:21,282 --> 00:08:23,217
( whistling )

128
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:25,886
Irene, I'm going to need
this month's catering receipts.

129
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:27,821
No problem.
I'll dig them out.

130
00:08:33,728 --> 00:08:35,763
Where do you
keep the coffee?

131
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:39,133
- I'm going to need something to get me through today.
- I'll make it.

132
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,905
By the way, I'd appreciate
you letting me know

133
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:47,141
next time you decide to
give me a helping hand.

134
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:49,643
- What are you on about?
- Toilet rolls.

135
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:51,812
There's about a dozen
missing from the storeroom.

136
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:55,048
Believe you me, toilet rolls are
the least of my worries right now.

137
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:57,550
Well, somebody's
taken them.

138
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:21,141
"Gas, electricity.

139
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:23,877
Water rates,

140
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:25,879
Grace"?

141
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,215
Who's Grace?

142
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:29,983
Don't worry
about me, dear,

143
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:31,919
I shall be out
of your hair in a moment.

144
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,454
- Cooking the books, are we?
- Now there's a thought.

145
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:37,157
Things aren't as bad
as that, surely.

146
00:09:37,158 --> 00:09:39,492
I'd set aside a week
at the end of the month

147
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:41,795
so I could get everything
sorted, and then...

148
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:45,199
then I find this-
tax return.

149
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,601
Due tomorrow "or penalties
and interest may be incurred. "

150
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:50,503
You have to keep track
of every penny

151
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:52,672
or they come down on you
like a ton of bricks.

152
00:09:52,673 --> 00:09:54,574
<i>I was hopeless
at doing the accounts.</i>

153
00:09:54,575 --> 00:09:56,810
You're probably still
suffering from my mistakes.

154
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:58,846
<i>I think I'm making
enough of my own.</i>

155
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:03,050
What am I going
to tell Archie?

156
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:05,018
At least it's only
for the last 12 months.

157
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:07,454
<i>You don't have to go
in the vault for anything.</i>

158
00:10:07,455 --> 00:10:09,389
Aye, thank the lord
for small mir-

159
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,124
what vault?

160
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,793
<i>( door opens )</i>

161
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:16,330
<i>Molly: It's not as
bad as it looks, dear.</i>

162
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:18,732
There is actually
a system in place.

163
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:20,834
Post-war, pre-war.

164
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:24,371
Was it the other way around?
Anyway, it's all ancient history.

165
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:27,741
Oh, you reckon?
When I cock up this tax return,

166
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:30,610
we are going to get audited.
They're going to come here,

167
00:10:30,611 --> 00:10:33,146
they're going to find something
undeclared in this mess.

168
00:10:33,147 --> 00:10:37,150
And then we'll get fined or our assets
will be seized and it will all be my fault.

169
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:39,686
Why don't you let me help you? Here.

170
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:41,388
Oh, no!
Molly, please don't!

171
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:43,790
Just leave it.

172
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,960
( sighs )

173
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:50,931
Oh, look, there's checkbooks
here and everything.

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,301
Molly, just let me
do this, eh?

175
00:10:54,302 --> 00:10:56,603
I understand.
You want it done properly.

176
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:11,051
"Grace"?

177
00:11:29,738 --> 00:11:32,539
- That should do it.
- Thanks.

178
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,308
Arch,
when you were a kid,

179
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:37,878
was there someone here
called Grace?

180
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,813
Not that I remember,
no. why?

181
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:41,715
Oh, no-
no reason.

182
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:44,051
<i>I just found a name
on some old pay slips-</i>

183
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:45,552
Archie!

184
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:49,223
You've got ink all over
your hands, be careful.

185
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:55,295
Lex, I know I'm being
a pain but it has been

186
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:57,798
months since we opened the
center and I'd like to get

187
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,067
some sort of idea
of how we're doing.

188
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:02,469
<i>Duncan:
Come in, Archie. over.</i>

189
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,972
Hello, Duncan.

190
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:09,042
Hello, Duncan,
over.

191
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:12,445
<i>There's a wee boy gone missing
from the school party. over.</i>

192
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:15,548
- I'll meet you in the drive.
- You'll find him, don't worry.

193
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:17,251
That's easier
said than done.

194
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:19,787
<i>You're supposed to say
"over and out. "</i>

195
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:21,054
Over and out.

196
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:23,490
<i>Just pretend you're
stalking the wee fella.</i>

197
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:25,759
Think what Golly would do
and just do that.

198
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,961
I just wish
he were still here.

199
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:30,964
So do I.

200
00:12:43,377 --> 00:12:45,345
Excuse me-

201
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:48,015
can't stop now. There'll be
someone in the house to help you.

202
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:50,184
Go, Dunc!

203
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,457
Hello?

204
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,492
Anybody home?

205
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:04,131
Butlers, footmen,
serfs, anyone?

206
00:13:07,268 --> 00:13:09,703
<i>Molly: These things are
heavier than I thought.</i>

207
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:12,472
Oh, would you
be a dear?

208
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:14,341
Uh, thank you
so much.

209
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:16,844
I was thinking
of having it there.

210
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:19,813
But it is so difficult to
visualize in the mind's eye.

211
00:13:19,814 --> 00:13:22,082
- Would you?
- ( sighs )

212
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:34,761
Umm... no.

213
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:36,529
<i>I shan't
keep you long.</i>

214
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,899
I know you've got
to get back to your children.

215
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,668
Children?
I haven't got any children.

216
00:13:41,669 --> 00:13:43,703
Mrs. MacDonald,
my name's-

217
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:51,178
<i>- ( stream running )
- Stevie?!</i>

218
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:55,949
Stevie,
are you there?

219
00:13:57,585 --> 00:14:00,354
It's no use. Let's try
going deeper into the woods.

220
00:14:00,355 --> 00:14:03,456
- We're always looking for something in life, aren't we?
- Yep.

221
00:14:03,457 --> 00:14:07,660
And then we find it
in the last place we expected.

222
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:11,598
- Don't you think searching the woods is a good idea?
- What? of course.

223
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:16,036
<i>No, I wasn't talking
about that specifically.</i>

224
00:14:16,037 --> 00:14:19,472
- Right.
- No, I mean, in general-

225
00:14:19,473 --> 00:14:21,474
like say for example
you and Lex.

226
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:23,443
You didn't know
you were looking,

227
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:25,312
and then you found
each other.

228
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:28,815
- Duncan, is there something on your mind?
- No? I mean, no.

229
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:31,818
Good, let's just concentrate
on the search, shall we?

230
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:35,055
- Yes, sorry.
- Look, it's not you that I'm mad at.

231
00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:36,957
It is this
whole situation.

232
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,759
How can we run this place if
we're not properly staffed?

233
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,562
The sooner we find a replacement
for Golly, the better.

234
00:14:56,911 --> 00:14:58,645
<i>Golly:
Don't eat that!</i>

235
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:02,782
I'm sorry- I'm sorry.

236
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:04,684
I'm not going to hurt you.

237
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:08,121
I wouldn't hurt you
for the world, son.

238
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:12,159
Okay? it's just that those-
those berries are bad for you.

239
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,294
<i>Give you a sore tummy.</i>

240
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:16,796
We don't want that,
do we?

241
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:22,035
You've lost your pals,
have you?

242
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:25,005
Well, come on then.

243
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:27,707
We'll go and find them.
Just over there.

244
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:34,747
That's a boy.
Oh, and listen- listen,

245
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:38,051
if your teacher gives you a telling
off, don't say you were lost,

246
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:40,720
all right? Just say you
were away for a wee explore.

247
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:42,956
Okay? come on.

248
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:46,360
My name's Golly, by the way.
What's yours?

249
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,295
- Stevie.
- Stevie.

250
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,339
I see the caffeine's
kicked in then.

251
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:05,878
I wasn't planning on serving
chicken for lunch, actually,

252
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,115
<i>- I've made soup.
- Soup- that's a great idea.</i>

253
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:10,717
You know,
I have my moments.

254
00:16:10,718 --> 00:16:14,087
Here, put some
in the flask for me.

255
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:15,888
Flask?
What for?

256
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:20,193
To keep it warm.

257
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:23,230
I suppose it's a nice enough
day for a picnic.

258
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:26,466
- I'm not going on a picnic.
- Then what are you doing?

259
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:29,603
Oh, well,
Archie and Duncan-

260
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:31,971
you know they've
not had any lunch today.

261
00:16:31,972 --> 00:16:34,441
So how can you form
an effective search party

262
00:16:34,442 --> 00:16:36,710
on an empty stomach, eh?

263
00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:55,495
You never know how long
they're gonna be out there for.

264
00:16:55,496 --> 00:16:58,865
Too much information,
Lexie- really.

265
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:11,611
- You poor dear. Are you
still here? - Yeah, just-

266
00:17:11,612 --> 00:17:14,314
- I'd forgotten all about you.
- You're here now, so-

267
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:16,650
why don't you run along
and join your class?

268
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:19,419
My class?
What's that supposed to mean?

269
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,921
Aren't you a teacher with one
of Archie's school trips?

270
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:24,791
No, Mrs. MacDonald, my name's
Martin Carter. We spoke on the phone.

271
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:29,028
Oh, no! but you're
a day early.

272
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:32,231
- I thought we said the 23rd.
- We did.

273
00:17:32,232 --> 00:17:35,802
Oh! oh, dear. And here I am
rearranging all the paintings to try

274
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:39,572
and make a good impression. You must
think I'm an absolute nincompoop.

275
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:41,741
Not at all. It's just
what I was expecting.

276
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:45,878
- Thank you. Lexie, this is-
- can't stop, sorry.

277
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:48,948
<i>Although it's fair to say
I was not expecting that.</i>

278
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:50,650
Great, Mrs. MacDonald!

279
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:52,719
Since we both
know the score now,

280
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,021
why don't you show me
what you've got to offer?

281
00:17:57,825 --> 00:18:00,694
All right now, remember,
look after yourself.

282
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:04,664
Okay?
Away you go.

283
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,281
I hope they're not
all like this.

284
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:25,184
I can shift most bits of
so-called heritage, but-

285
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:27,119
that's not for sale,
anyway.

286
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,588
I see, well...

287
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:30,957
maybe you can show me
the ones that are up for sale.

288
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,892
It might save us
a wee bit of time, eh?

289
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:35,995
There was one on the staircase,
might have some potential.

290
00:18:35,996 --> 00:18:38,130
I thought you might
appreciate that one.

291
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:40,500
That's why I brought it
down from the back landing.

292
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:43,703
That's not for sale, either. Those
paintings belong to the house.

293
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:47,206
But you've spent the morning working
out the best way to display them.

294
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:51,143
Why do that if not to-
ply your wares.

295
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:54,748
<i>We spoke on the phone
about you selling art to me.</i>

296
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:56,583
<i>Of course,</i>

297
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,551
and here we are.

298
00:18:59,854 --> 00:19:01,688
Ta-da!

299
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:05,625
<i>All my own work.</i>

300
00:19:28,449 --> 00:19:31,551
Hello?!

301
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:33,453
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

302
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:37,424
I know that you're out there,
you old numpty.

303
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,628
Look, you can't
keep doing this-

304
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:44,931
<i>living like a hermit,
all on your own.</i>

305
00:19:44,932 --> 00:19:47,834
There's people at the house
that miss you-

306
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:50,169
care about you.

307
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,709
Just get yourself
home, man.

308
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,412
Just...

309
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:01,614
get yourself home.

310
00:20:01,615 --> 00:20:03,516
<i>Duncan:
Archie! Archie!</i>

311
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:05,485
Wait till
you hear this.

312
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:08,621
Wee Stevie,
he said he was rescued

313
00:20:08,622 --> 00:20:10,557
by the old man
of the woods.

314
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,827
- Really?
- Kids, eh?

315
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:16,930
It's amazing what they'll come
up with to get out of trouble.

316
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:19,799
I don't think the old man
of the woods is made up.

317
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,034
I think he's about
as real as you and me.

318
00:20:35,516 --> 00:20:37,984
I see you haven't
lost you appetite then.

319
00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:43,490
I suppose you're going
to turn me in.

320
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:45,492
What else can I do?

321
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:48,327
You could let me be-

322
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:51,631
though that's more than some
folk round here can manage.

323
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:55,502
You're asking
a lot of me.

324
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:59,305
I said I just wanted to be
left alone, lass, that's all.

325
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:20,660
Been for a spin,
have you?

326
00:21:20,661 --> 00:21:22,829
Yeah, just had
to clear my head.

327
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,565
I saw you.
I know what you were doing.

328
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:28,601
- Were you spying on me?
- You're in cahoots with Golly.

329
00:21:28,602 --> 00:21:31,070
- What?
- "Too early to get someone new in. "

330
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:33,940
"Why don't you try his daughter
again?" What are you playing?

331
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:37,076
I didn't know then. I just worked
it out myself about an hour ago.

332
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:40,647
- That's when I went to see him.
- You were planning on telling me?

333
00:21:40,648 --> 00:21:43,249
Yeah- well,
no, not exactly.

334
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,585
- Marvelous.
- I wanted to give Golly

335
00:21:45,586 --> 00:21:47,987
a chance to come back
of his own accord.

336
00:21:47,988 --> 00:21:50,289
Didn't want someone
bullying him into it.

337
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,391
Is that what you
think I am, a bully?

338
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:54,060
Look! company.

339
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:56,696
<i>- I'm dreadfully sorry.
- So am I, Mrs. MacDonald.</i>

340
00:21:56,697 --> 00:21:59,532
Sorry I've driven from Glasgow
to look at some doodlings.

341
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:03,402
- They were that bad?
- Where did you learn about art, "paint along with Nancy"?

342
00:22:03,403 --> 00:22:05,371
Excuse me. Who are
you and what gives you

343
00:22:05,372 --> 00:22:07,373
the right to speak
to my mother like that?

344
00:22:07,374 --> 00:22:09,709
It's all right, dear.
He's only being honest.

345
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,311
Martin Carter. I tried to
introduce myself this morning

346
00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:15,281
but you left in a hurry. You
probably had a stag to shoot.

347
00:22:15,282 --> 00:22:17,984
It's lovely to meet you,
your lairdship, but I'm away.

348
00:22:17,985 --> 00:22:21,854
You're an art dealer? Are you
interested in some of our paintings?

349
00:22:21,855 --> 00:22:25,324
I was. I came here this
morning with money to spend but-

350
00:22:25,325 --> 00:22:28,327
- we don't need your money.
- Let's not be too hasty now.

351
00:22:28,328 --> 00:22:30,196
We have got
a business to run.

352
00:22:30,197 --> 00:22:32,131
We have to maximize
our strengths.

353
00:22:32,132 --> 00:22:34,801
- Even if that means dealing with this...?
- This what?

354
00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:37,236
Let's simmer down,
shall we, boys?

355
00:22:37,237 --> 00:22:39,238
Why don't I
take Mr. Carter

356
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:41,908
into the kitchen and
give him a spot of lunch?

357
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:43,977
Then we can maybe
talk some business.

358
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:45,745
Lunch, great.
Why don't you sell

359
00:22:45,746 --> 00:22:48,014
some of the family silver
while you're at it?

360
00:22:48,015 --> 00:22:50,249
( groans )

361
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,455
- Crisis over?
- Uh-huh.

362
00:22:58,358 --> 00:23:01,560
In fact, I don't have any more
school parties this afternoon,

363
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:04,831
which means I've got
some time on my hands.

364
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:13,907
You must miss the city
living out here, eh?

365
00:23:13,908 --> 00:23:16,843
The bars,
the restaurants, clubs?

366
00:23:16,844 --> 00:23:19,312
Clubs?
( laughs )

367
00:23:19,313 --> 00:23:22,015
I can't remember
the last time I went dancing.

368
00:23:22,016 --> 00:23:23,817
Not counting ceilidhs.

369
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:25,484
Ceilidhs?

370
00:23:25,485 --> 00:23:27,954
I had you down as deep house,
not country house.

371
00:23:27,955 --> 00:23:30,323
Used to be.

372
00:23:30,324 --> 00:23:34,127
I used to go to the tunnel,
the Sub Club, the art school.

373
00:23:34,128 --> 00:23:38,131
- I used to go every Friday.
- Did you? probably there on the same night.

374
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:41,467
No, I think I would
have remembered you.

375
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:46,873
You don't go back to Glasgow
much then, eh? That's a pity.

376
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:49,209
No, I'm very happy here.

377
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,911
Come on, you don't really
buy any of this, do you?

378
00:23:51,912 --> 00:23:54,547
Tradition, heritage,
it's so phony.

379
00:23:54,548 --> 00:23:56,482
That's a bit cynical,
isn't it?

380
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:58,718
Coming from someone who
buys and sells the stuff.

381
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:01,154
And doing quite well
out of it

382
00:24:01,155 --> 00:24:03,322
judging by the sharp suit
and the flashy car.

383
00:24:03,323 --> 00:24:05,992
I bought them on my own from
a business I set up myself.

384
00:24:05,993 --> 00:24:08,661
I didn't get everything
handed to me on a plate

385
00:24:08,662 --> 00:24:11,664
because of the public school
I went to and who my father was.

386
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:13,967
It's not like that here.
We all work very hard.

387
00:24:13,968 --> 00:24:17,370
Don't get me wrong, Lexie, I can see
it's all worked out very nicely for you.

388
00:24:17,371 --> 00:24:19,505
You're obviously
onto a good thing.

389
00:24:19,506 --> 00:24:20,940
You married
the laird himself.

390
00:24:20,941 --> 00:24:22,608
<i>I don't like
what you're implying.</i>

391
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:26,112
I was working at Glenbogle a long
time before I even met Archie.

392
00:24:26,113 --> 00:24:28,314
No offense.

393
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:31,918
I suppose if you were
only interested in money,

394
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,087
you wouldn't be wasting
your time here.

395
00:24:34,088 --> 00:24:37,423
- I know these big old houses cost a packet to keep going.
- We do okay.

396
00:24:37,424 --> 00:24:41,194
But not okay enough to let
your hubby show me the door, eh?

397
00:24:41,195 --> 00:24:44,730
Why don't you go and have
a wee look around the house?

398
00:24:44,731 --> 00:24:47,000
See if anything
takes your fancy.

399
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:50,236
<i>- Paintings, I mean.
- are you sure?</i>

400
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:52,205
The laird didn't seem
keen on selling.

401
00:24:53,941 --> 00:24:56,342
Just you leave
the laird to me.

402
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:01,014
( sighs )

403
00:25:09,723 --> 00:25:13,492
<i>- Hello there, big man.
- Molly: oh, hello again.</i>

404
00:25:13,493 --> 00:25:16,930
Don't let me disturb you.
I'm just putting these away.

405
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:19,465
Mrs. MacDonald,
I owe you an apology.

406
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:22,401
I was very short this morning.
It was a misunderstanding.

407
00:25:22,402 --> 00:25:25,538
But, of course. It was
foolish of me to think

408
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:26,906
that these might
be worth something.

409
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:29,408
I'd sold a few
to visitors and I suppose

410
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:31,610
it gave me delusions
of grandeur.

411
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:34,547
How much? What sort of price
tag are we talking about?

412
00:25:34,548 --> 00:25:36,682
I think �50 was
my best effort.

413
00:25:36,683 --> 00:25:39,052
50? you're practically
giving them away.

414
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:40,887
<i>- ( laughs )
- the thing about art-</i>

415
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:42,688
you've got to find
the right market.

416
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:45,591
Take this fella for instance.
It's not my cup of tea at all,

417
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:47,660
give me a pickled
sheep's carcass any day,

418
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:49,863
but I should be able
to shift him for you.

419
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:53,733
Lots of ancestry addicts in the
States and Canada ready to snap him up.

420
00:25:53,734 --> 00:25:57,536
Maybe this trip wasn't a
complete waste of time after all.

421
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:03,509
I just don't want to sell what's left
of our heritage to somebody like that.

422
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,980
Like what, Glaswegian? Working
class? does that remind you of anyone?

423
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:10,884
That's not what I mean and you know it.
The guy's obviously out to make a killing

424
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:14,153
and can smell someone desperate
to sell. Are we desperate, Lex?

425
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:19,893
Then let me take a look at the books
- things might not be as bad as all that.

426
00:26:19,894 --> 00:26:22,362
<i>- No. it's my job-
- ( knocking )</i>

427
00:26:22,363 --> 00:26:24,530
Not interrupting
anything, am I?

428
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:27,433
I'm thinking about making
an offer for this.

429
00:26:27,434 --> 00:26:32,538
Oh! any sale would be a
wrench, especially for Archie.

430
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:35,141
That's old Cuthbert,
wasn't he in the vault?

431
00:26:35,142 --> 00:26:37,176
Molly's been moving
stuff around.

432
00:26:37,177 --> 00:26:39,578
<i>It's interesting
- but the folk that buy this stuff</i>

433
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:41,447
<i>only care about one thing-
authenticity.</i>

434
00:26:41,448 --> 00:26:43,816
We'll need to find
the documents of provenance.

435
00:26:43,817 --> 00:26:45,484
If I can prove
it was painted

436
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:47,853
on the bonnie, bonnie banks
of some loch or other

437
00:26:47,854 --> 00:26:50,323
it's going to up the value-
to the buyer,

438
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:52,125
the dealer and the vendor.

439
00:26:52,126 --> 00:26:55,995
Archie: What if we want to
have it valued independently?

440
00:26:55,996 --> 00:26:58,631
<i>Lexie: Darling, weren't
you going to track down</i>

441
00:26:58,632 --> 00:27:01,667
that old friend of ours?
Remember?

442
00:27:01,668 --> 00:27:03,202
Fine.

443
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:04,503
I won't be long.

444
00:27:04,504 --> 00:27:07,307
<i>And we'll talk
as soon as I get back.</i>

445
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:09,475
Fine.

446
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:21,087
Duncan: I just can'
get you out of my mind...

447
00:27:21,088 --> 00:27:23,222
... was more
than a dear

448
00:27:23,223 --> 00:27:26,259
to think about.
( humming )

449
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,996
- You're in a good mood.
- Yeah, I guess I am, really.

450
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:33,266
Irene give you a bit of a
treat for lunch, did she?

451
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:35,435
Well, you know...

452
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:37,503
favoritism- shocking.

453
00:27:37,504 --> 00:27:39,738
So where are we
off to, Arch?

454
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:42,175
<i>We are going
to track down</i>

455
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:44,543
the wild man
of the woods.

456
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:48,647
Golly, we're bringing
Golly home.

457
00:27:53,187 --> 00:27:56,622
This Grace, she couldn't own a
business or something, could she?

458
00:27:56,623 --> 00:27:58,591
Somewhere Hector used
to shop, maybe?

459
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,626
No, there was no
invoices or anything.

460
00:28:00,627 --> 00:28:03,662
And these checkbooks were
just tucked away- hidden.

461
00:28:03,663 --> 00:28:05,731
<i>But I need to find out
who she is-</i>

462
00:28:05,732 --> 00:28:09,335
as far as I can see, the money is still
coming out of the business account.

463
00:28:09,336 --> 00:28:11,905
That's not going to look
very good to the tax man.

464
00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:15,008
You think Hector was claiming
his mistress as an expense?

465
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:18,411
Until I find another
explanation, yeah.

466
00:28:18,412 --> 00:28:20,380
Classy.

467
00:28:20,381 --> 00:28:22,115
<i>Poor Molly.</i>

468
00:28:22,116 --> 00:28:24,683
Mrs. MacDonald found
what we're after.

469
00:28:24,684 --> 00:28:27,253
I'm glad to have made
myself useful for once.

470
00:28:27,254 --> 00:28:30,723
Don't talk about yourself like that.
come on, we've got a party to get you to.

471
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:33,526
Actually, I was thinking
I might stay at home tonight.

472
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:36,429
Then think again. It's glad
rags time. Come on, let's go!

473
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:40,433
Goodbye, Cuthbert. You're old
and unwanted but I shall miss you.

474
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:44,137
Touching stuff, but I hope
you're not going to pull

475
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:46,439
<i>any romantic attachment
to the past rubbish</i>

476
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,541
<i>to bump the price up.</i>

477
00:28:48,542 --> 00:28:50,243
It's not rubbish
though, is it?

478
00:28:50,244 --> 00:28:52,145
People do get
attached to the past

479
00:28:52,146 --> 00:28:54,814
because they think it's
something they can count on,

480
00:28:54,815 --> 00:28:57,083
something that can't change.
But it can.

481
00:28:57,084 --> 00:28:58,751
I'm not with you.

482
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:03,189
Look, I need more time to think
before I give anything away.

483
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,558
You'd be selling
not giving.

484
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:08,527
I'm not going to be rushed
into making a decision.

485
00:29:08,528 --> 00:29:11,630
Okay. it so happens
I'm around for one more day.

486
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:15,168
I'll come back tomorrow. You can
decide if you're ready to take my money.

487
00:29:17,704 --> 00:29:20,106
You're so kind,
Irene.

488
00:29:20,107 --> 00:29:23,109
You deserve to go out and
have a good time, that's all.

489
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,945
All those bright young things.
I'm not sure about this.

490
00:29:25,946 --> 00:29:29,315
I've already been made to feel
quite foolish enough by Mr. Carter.

491
00:29:29,316 --> 00:29:31,717
- Oh, but-
- I'm serious.

492
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:34,887
It was my dream to see
my paintings in an exhibition,

493
00:29:34,888 --> 00:29:37,256
<i>not to make
an exhibition of myself.</i>

494
00:29:37,257 --> 00:29:40,826
At least when Hector was alive,
someone else provided the floor show.

495
00:29:40,827 --> 00:29:42,795
Forget about Hector!

496
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:49,335
Look, what I mean is, you've got
so much to offer in your own right.

497
00:29:49,336 --> 00:29:52,605
<i>Okay, so you might feel
a bit out of place at this do,</i>

498
00:29:52,606 --> 00:29:55,574
but we can soon
put that right.

499
00:29:57,444 --> 00:30:00,146
<i>Duncan: What's he playing at? Honestly?</i>

500
00:30:00,147 --> 00:30:01,514
Search me.

501
00:30:01,515 --> 00:30:04,083
A man of his age.
I wish he'd make his mind up.

502
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:06,652
"I'm quitting Glenbogle.
I'm not quitting Glenbogle. "

503
00:30:06,653 --> 00:30:09,122
I mean, what's it
going to be, Golly?

504
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:11,624
I should have known
he'd never leave this place.

505
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:14,827
This is it. This is
where she left the hamper.

506
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:18,097
If we're going to find him
this is a good place to start.

507
00:30:18,098 --> 00:30:20,299
Aye, if-
if-?

508
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,301
We will find him.

509
00:30:22,302 --> 00:30:24,303
No matter what,

510
00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:26,305
we're going to find him.

511
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,745
Do you smell anything?

512
00:30:32,746 --> 00:30:34,947
Aye, it's grass.

513
00:30:35,982 --> 00:30:37,950
Do you think
he took the food?

514
00:30:37,951 --> 00:30:40,819
It's hard to say, Duncan.
It could have been any one

515
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,323
- of the people who live wild on the estate.
- You mean there's more?

516
00:30:44,324 --> 00:30:46,592
Nobody ever
tells me anything.

517
00:30:46,593 --> 00:30:48,961
Oh, I'm not sure
about this.

518
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:51,431
I am. You shall go to
the ball, Cinderella,

519
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,899
and you shall
knock 'em dead, okay?

520
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,968
Good.

521
00:30:55,969 --> 00:30:59,405
You're at this very hip
and trendy soiree.

522
00:30:59,406 --> 00:31:02,108
Hip, trendy,
cool, gotcha.

523
00:31:02,109 --> 00:31:04,377
- ( laughs )
- Good.

524
00:31:04,378 --> 00:31:07,280
A gentleman
approaches you.

525
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:10,349
"Good evening. "

526
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,751
"How do you do?"

527
00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:16,122
"I was just wondering,
could I get you a drink?"

528
00:31:16,123 --> 00:31:18,057
"Oh, that's very kind.

529
00:31:18,058 --> 00:31:20,193
How about a dry sherry?"

530
00:31:21,562 --> 00:31:23,362
Molly...

531
00:31:23,363 --> 00:31:26,232
"how do you do?" Was bad
enough, but dry sherry-

532
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:29,068
you can do better than that.
Loosen up a little. Be yourself.

533
00:31:29,069 --> 00:31:32,071
Well, what should
I have asked for?

534
00:31:32,072 --> 00:31:35,408
I think there are
two ways to go on this.

535
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:37,743
<i>The sophisticated
classics</i>

536
00:31:37,744 --> 00:31:41,180
- like a cosmopolitan or a manhattan.
- And the other way?

537
00:31:41,181 --> 00:31:44,049
Something a bit
more daring.

538
00:31:47,187 --> 00:31:49,489
Tequila!

539
00:31:57,998 --> 00:32:00,399
( sighs )
Okay, Grace,

540
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,701
I know you're
in here somewhere.

541
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:11,844
We're wasting our time.
He could be anywhere.

542
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:14,947
So are we just going
to head home then?

543
00:32:14,948 --> 00:32:17,249
No, no, no, we're
going to find the old-

544
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:21,187
look, you know when
he takes us stalking,

545
00:32:21,188 --> 00:32:23,022
what is it
that he always says?

546
00:32:23,023 --> 00:32:25,457
"Whiskey and shotguns
do not mix. "

547
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,927
Yeah, yeah,
but I was thinking more-

548
00:32:27,928 --> 00:32:30,395
the one about how
"the land is a book

549
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:32,298
and we've got to learn
how to read it. "

550
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:35,367
Yeah, yeah. That was one
of his favorites, actually.

551
00:32:35,368 --> 00:32:37,703
So that is what we're
going to have to do.

552
00:32:37,704 --> 00:32:40,005
Look for
the slightest clue.

553
00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:42,107
Something that's
not quite right.

554
00:32:42,108 --> 00:32:43,976
A broken twig,

555
00:32:43,977 --> 00:32:46,345
a thread of cotton
on a branch-

556
00:32:46,346 --> 00:32:48,647
sort of thing
that only somebody

557
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:51,050
really in tune
with nature would notice.

558
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,225
Hmm.

559
00:32:59,226 --> 00:33:01,760
I've been into art
for years. yeah?

560
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:03,628
Modern stuff mainly.

561
00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:07,132
- I've been a fan since Warhol actually.
- Oh, he was "the man. "

562
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:09,869
Although one could say
his greatest work of art

563
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,171
was his own persona.

564
00:33:14,074 --> 00:33:16,708
( chuckles ) What, have I
gone to the square again?

565
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:20,645
No, that was really cool.
Just wasn't ready for it.

566
00:33:20,646 --> 00:33:22,915
So I really am
kicking donkey.

567
00:33:25,018 --> 00:33:27,652
- You go, girl.
- Go where?

568
00:33:27,653 --> 00:33:29,355
Anywhere you want,
Molly.

569
00:33:35,461 --> 00:33:37,496
- Mmm.
- Mmm!

570
00:33:37,497 --> 00:33:40,299
- Ahh.
- Perhaps I shouldn't go alone.

571
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:43,769
What about another?

572
00:33:44,938 --> 00:33:47,406
So do you think he'll
be pleased to see us?

573
00:33:47,407 --> 00:33:50,642
I don't think he'll be
rolling out the red carpet, no.

574
00:33:50,643 --> 00:33:54,179
Well, maybe we should
just leave him alone.

575
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,348
No, no way.

576
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:58,884
We're not going anywhere
without talking to him.

577
00:33:58,885 --> 00:34:01,253
Having a row
you mean?

578
00:34:01,254 --> 00:34:04,790
Whatever it takes
to make him see sense.

579
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:07,259
That usually
adds up to a row

580
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,628
between you two
these days.

581
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:13,065
No offense, Arch, it wouldn't
exactly be the first barney

582
00:34:13,066 --> 00:34:14,633
you and Golly
have had, would it?

583
00:34:14,634 --> 00:34:16,902
You'll be there to keep
the peace, won't you?

584
00:34:16,903 --> 00:34:18,770
Ah, well you see,
that's just it.

585
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:21,473
I'm not exactly Golly's
favorite person at the moment.

586
00:34:21,474 --> 00:34:24,043
I don't know what he's
going to say when he sees me.

587
00:34:24,044 --> 00:34:26,145
We're about to find out. Come on.

588
00:34:44,197 --> 00:34:46,598
Maybe we should
just wait here.

589
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:49,969
<i>Golly: You've come this far,
you might as well come in.</i>

590
00:35:01,748 --> 00:35:04,783
- Right. ready to circulate?
- No.

591
00:35:04,784 --> 00:35:06,785
Good,
that's the spirit.

592
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:09,255
Come on, let's see if we
can spot a friendly face.

593
00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:39,485
It's nice here, Golly.

594
00:35:41,921 --> 00:35:44,556
Hasn't he made a nice
wee house for himself, Archie?

595
00:35:46,493 --> 00:35:50,262
Oh, yeah, I'm sure "Country
Life" will be along any minute.

596
00:35:50,263 --> 00:35:52,331
"Caves are the new cottages"
or something.

597
00:36:00,774 --> 00:36:03,275
I'm sorry, I didn't come
here to make fun of you.

598
00:36:03,276 --> 00:36:05,944
I came to bring
you home.

599
00:36:11,017 --> 00:36:13,319
It's good to be here,
seeing work like this.

600
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,955
I've spent the last eight hours surrounded
by stuffed animals and dead ancestors.

601
00:36:16,956 --> 00:36:20,459
I imagine anyone might find that
kind of atmosphere oppressive.

602
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,495
But since your tastes
run to the modern,

603
00:36:23,496 --> 00:36:25,431
what do you think
of this?

604
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:28,634
I like it,
I have to say.

605
00:36:28,635 --> 00:36:32,270
It has a still quality to it.
A coldness almost.

606
00:36:32,271 --> 00:36:34,039
Reminds me
of early Hockney.

607
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,408
Really? I remember him
saying to me at a do,

608
00:36:36,409 --> 00:36:38,577
not unlike this one,
that it saddened him

609
00:36:38,578 --> 00:36:41,146
that people never found
the warmth in his work.

610
00:36:41,147 --> 00:36:44,717
<i>You went to a party
with David Hockney?</i>

611
00:36:44,718 --> 00:36:47,553
I actually went with David Bailey
but he happened to be there.

612
00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:51,957
I think the party was given by
Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithful.

613
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,925
Could I get you
a glass of champagne?

614
00:36:53,926 --> 00:36:56,127
Why not?

615
00:36:59,733 --> 00:37:01,700
- We're going.
- What?

616
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:05,136
First rule of call, Molly,
always leave them wanting more.

617
00:37:06,305 --> 00:37:09,641
It is Irene, isn't it?
I thought so.

618
00:37:09,642 --> 00:37:13,579
Camilla Doyle? I designed the
menus for the hotel in Edinburgh.

619
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,881
Yes, of course,
I remember you.

620
00:37:15,882 --> 00:37:18,216
I'm ashamed I haven't
had time to pop in yet.

621
00:37:18,217 --> 00:37:20,452
I've been working in London.
How's it all going?

622
00:37:20,453 --> 00:37:23,722
- Oh, great, you know. Busy,
busy, busy. - Fab. and how's-

623
00:37:23,723 --> 00:37:26,492
I'd love to stay and chat,
but you know how it is. bye.

624
00:37:32,331 --> 00:37:36,034
I'd like to see either of you
two make it on your own out here.

625
00:37:37,804 --> 00:37:39,838
I admit it,
I'm impressed.

626
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,340
You've been living off the
land, fishing in the loch.

627
00:37:42,341 --> 00:37:44,643
It's all real
back-to-nature stuff.

628
00:37:44,644 --> 00:37:46,845
I though you weren't
here to make fun.

629
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:49,648
<i>I'm not. I'm trying
to make you see sense.</i>

630
00:37:49,649 --> 00:37:52,551
You mean see things the way
you do. That's different.

631
00:37:52,552 --> 00:37:56,054
If you're not happy with your work at
the wildlife center, we can talk about it.

632
00:37:56,055 --> 00:37:59,124
- Wildlife center.
- We can't all live in the stone age.

633
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:01,927
It may come as a shock and
surprise to you, Archie,

634
00:38:01,928 --> 00:38:04,296
<i>but I have nothing against
moving with the times.</i>

635
00:38:04,297 --> 00:38:06,998
And everything I'm doing is to
secure a future for Glenbogle.

636
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:08,901
As long as you don't
forget the past!

637
00:38:08,902 --> 00:38:10,602
If Glenbogle is
worth anything

638
00:38:10,603 --> 00:38:13,004
it's because of what
the past made it.

639
00:38:13,005 --> 00:38:15,441
It made it the place it is
and us the people we are.

640
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:19,344
<i>That's one reason I want you to come home
- you've lived here all your life.</i>

641
00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:22,514
- Thought I'd never leave.
- And you don't have to.

642
00:38:22,515 --> 00:38:24,516
Time to move on, Archie.

643
00:38:24,517 --> 00:38:26,351
<i>Why?</i>

644
00:38:26,352 --> 00:38:28,454
<i>I don't understand-</i>

645
00:38:28,455 --> 00:38:31,790
because I don't want to end up a blind
old man getting in everyone's way.

646
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:40,432
We can work something out.

647
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:44,035
Even in this light I know
a look of pity when I see one.

648
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:04,956
Oh, Lexie, dear,
are you still doing this?

649
00:39:04,957 --> 00:39:08,260
( sighs )
No, no.

650
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:10,362
I'm finished in here.

651
00:39:10,363 --> 00:39:13,632
Molly, I need
to ask you a question.

652
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:15,166
<i>Could-</i>

653
00:39:16,269 --> 00:39:19,605
I don't want
to upset you, but-

654
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:21,840
there's nowhere else
Archie's dad

655
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:24,776
might have kept
- you know, sensitive stuff?

656
00:39:26,979 --> 00:39:29,180
Well, the only place
I can think of

657
00:39:29,181 --> 00:39:32,984
- is Hector's private safe.
- Hector's what?

658
00:39:35,855 --> 00:39:38,156
- D-do you know the
combination? - Not a clue.

659
00:39:38,157 --> 00:39:39,758
Right, Molly, think.

660
00:39:39,759 --> 00:39:43,395
Anniversaries? Oh, the
boys' birthdays? Anything?

661
00:39:44,697 --> 00:39:47,899
Try 11-05-36.

662
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,603
<i>- Irene: what's that?
- The day Hector caught his first trout in the loch.</i>

663
00:39:54,741 --> 00:39:56,475
( gasps )

664
00:40:02,582 --> 00:40:04,849
We can look into this.
I'm sure medical science

665
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,286
<i>has moved on
since your father's day.</i>

666
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:09,388
Doctors?

667
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:14,092
You mean you haven't
even had your eyes tested?

668
00:40:14,093 --> 00:40:16,461
We want to help.

669
00:40:16,462 --> 00:40:19,598
- We are your friends.
- Is that a fact?

670
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,633
You both have a funny way
of showing it.

671
00:40:23,235 --> 00:40:25,203
I've had
enough of this.

672
00:40:30,576 --> 00:40:32,944
<i>- Look, Golly-
- ( Duncan yells )</i>

673
00:40:34,213 --> 00:40:36,715
( Duncan grunting in pain )

674
00:40:38,017 --> 00:40:41,219
- What is this?
- Oh, nothing!

675
00:40:44,223 --> 00:40:46,224
But you came
to help me.

676
00:40:46,225 --> 00:40:48,794
I only came because
this place is full of potholes

677
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:52,063
and I didn't want you breaking your
leg out here in the middle of nowhere.

678
00:40:52,064 --> 00:40:54,833
A likely story, Golly. Why don't you just admit
- ( screams )

679
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:01,773
Oh, these look like-

680
00:41:01,774 --> 00:41:03,508
love letters.

681
00:41:03,509 --> 00:41:06,745
Oh, they are.

682
00:41:08,113 --> 00:41:10,716
They're from me.

683
00:41:10,717 --> 00:41:14,353
I had no idea Hector
kept them all these years.

684
00:41:14,354 --> 00:41:17,522
Well, all that's left
is this, but-

685
00:41:17,523 --> 00:41:20,992
- but you don't really need to read that, Molly.
- Whyever not?

686
00:41:20,993 --> 00:41:24,629
Grace, I know all about Grace.
Hector told me everything.

687
00:41:27,767 --> 00:41:30,168
Oh my god.

688
00:41:32,204 --> 00:41:34,406
<i>Golly: No, don't try and stand on it.</i>

689
00:41:34,407 --> 00:41:36,941
<i>- it may be broken.
- I think it's just a sprain.</i>

690
00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:40,311
The arm's worse.

691
00:41:40,312 --> 00:41:43,415
- Will I get an ambulance?
- No, it'll take hours to get here.

692
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:47,185
It's getting cold. We'll both
have to move him ourselves.

693
00:41:47,186 --> 00:41:49,954
- Are you up for it, Duncan?
- Aye.

694
00:41:49,955 --> 00:41:52,357
Good man. Archie, you
just stay where you are

695
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:54,493
and we'll get you
out of there in no time.

696
00:41:54,494 --> 00:41:57,962
( chuckles )
Stay where I am.

697
00:41:57,963 --> 00:41:59,731
Okay, if you insist.

698
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:02,734
I'll only be a minute.

699
00:42:06,873 --> 00:42:09,107
I mean it
- I appreciate your help. I really do.

700
00:42:09,108 --> 00:42:11,843
But I think this is
a one woman job now.

701
00:42:11,844 --> 00:42:14,078
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

702
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,449
Now that we solved that Grace mystery,
I can go on and do this tax return.

703
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,584
I might even get it
finished by breakfast.

704
00:42:19,585 --> 00:42:21,520
Now go.

705
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:23,622
<i>- Good luck, Lex.
- thanks, Irene.</i>

706
00:42:26,859 --> 00:42:28,427
Okay.

707
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:34,532
Okay, Duncan.

708
00:42:36,335 --> 00:42:38,770
All right,
let's have a look at you.

709
00:42:38,771 --> 00:42:41,873
- ( screams )
- I'm sorry, son, sorry.

710
00:42:41,874 --> 00:42:44,476
Duncan can't
lift both of us.

711
00:42:44,477 --> 00:42:47,412
Even if he could,
the rope wouldn't take it.

712
00:42:47,413 --> 00:42:50,415
What about some sort
of harness?

713
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:52,417
We could,
but I'm still a problem.

714
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,121
- All right!
- Golly, no!

715
00:42:56,122 --> 00:42:58,857
It's all right, Duncan,
I know what I'm doing.

716
00:42:58,858 --> 00:43:00,993
You trust me,
don't you, Archie?

717
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:03,929
Yeah.

718
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:07,065
Good man.
Okay.

719
00:43:29,122 --> 00:43:31,089
Okay, boys,

720
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:33,158
come home to us now.

721
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:35,627
You've had your fun.

722
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,668
<i>Okay, son,
this is going to hurt,</i>

723
00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:45,403
but once you get your shoulder
in, we'll get you out, okay?

724
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:49,407
All right, after three. One...

725
00:43:49,408 --> 00:43:52,177
two... three.

726
00:43:52,178 --> 00:43:53,779
<i>( screaming )</i>

727
00:43:56,716 --> 00:43:59,417
( hyperventilating )
Sorry.

728
00:43:59,418 --> 00:44:01,953
<i>A bit squeamish.</i>

729
00:44:01,954 --> 00:44:03,822
Sorry.

730
00:44:06,926 --> 00:44:08,126
<i>Okay.</i>

731
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,841
Archie?
What happened?

732
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:24,843
It's okay.
It's just a sprain.

733
00:44:24,844 --> 00:44:26,845
I'll be fine.
Golly, I can manage.

734
00:44:26,846 --> 00:44:28,947
Last time you hurt
yourself on the estate

735
00:44:28,948 --> 00:44:31,149
I carried you in.
Seven I think you were.

736
00:44:35,287 --> 00:44:36,955
What is it?

737
00:44:36,956 --> 00:44:39,557
I never thought I'd
set foot in here again.

738
00:44:39,558 --> 00:44:42,194
Come on.

739
00:44:42,195 --> 00:44:44,029
Thank you.

740
00:44:45,664 --> 00:44:48,100
Lexie: Thanks for bringing
him home to me, Golly.

741
00:44:48,101 --> 00:44:50,869
I couldn't have managed it
without Duncan's help.

742
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:55,340
- Golly: He's a great asset to you, Archie.
- I know he is.

743
00:44:55,341 --> 00:44:59,277
It's good to know that the place'll
be in safe hands once I'm away.

744
00:44:59,278 --> 00:45:02,647
You're not going anywhere-
except to an eye specialist.

745
00:45:02,648 --> 00:45:05,283
With any luck, all you'll
need is a zap with a laser.

746
00:45:05,284 --> 00:45:08,153
<i>- Just wait a wee minute,
here- - Lexie: what for?</i>

747
00:45:08,154 --> 00:45:12,390
You have the treatment, and then you
let our old pal Grace pick up the tab.

748
00:45:12,391 --> 00:45:14,926
Grace?

749
00:45:14,927 --> 00:45:18,930
Glenbogle Residents
And Artisans Care Expenses.

750
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:22,200
<i>Lexie: Hector set up
an account years ago</i>

751
00:45:22,201 --> 00:45:25,103
<i>and put money into it
- even though the estate was struggling.</i>

752
00:45:25,104 --> 00:45:29,074
<i>And I'm sure he wouldn't mind
if Golly was a beneficiary.</i>

753
00:45:29,075 --> 00:45:31,810
<i>- Archie: I think he'd be delighted.
- I don't know.</i>

754
00:45:31,811 --> 00:45:33,678
<i>Look, the money
is there for you.</i>

755
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:37,249
It's like a charitable trust
so nobody else can touch it.

756
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,418
And the tax man can take every
penny we've got but not this.

757
00:45:40,419 --> 00:45:42,320
I don't want
your charity, lassie.

758
00:45:42,321 --> 00:45:44,756
<i>For goodness sake, you've
spent your entire life</i>

759
00:45:44,757 --> 00:45:46,958
taking care of Glenbogle
and everybody in it.

760
00:45:46,959 --> 00:45:48,960
It's about time we did
something for you.

761
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:51,263
- So that's it then?
- Yeah.

762
00:45:51,264 --> 00:45:54,199
- You're going to look after me?
- Yes.

763
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:56,868
Good.

764
00:46:01,841 --> 00:46:03,775
Welcome home, Golly.

765
00:46:03,776 --> 00:46:05,277
Welcome home.

766
00:46:05,278 --> 00:46:07,779
<i>- Welcome home, Golly.
- Lexie: welcome home.</i>

767
00:46:09,949 --> 00:46:11,917
You all right?

768
00:46:11,918 --> 00:46:13,919
Me? brilliant.

769
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,887
It's just, well...

770
00:46:17,589 --> 00:46:20,091
it feels strange...

771
00:46:20,092 --> 00:46:21,927
being with me...

772
00:46:21,928 --> 00:46:23,929
now that Golly's back.

773
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:25,697
Yeah.

774
00:46:25,698 --> 00:46:28,066
Look, if you want to go
back to your own room-

775
00:46:28,067 --> 00:46:31,036
oh, no, no, this is where
I want to be... definitely.

776
00:46:33,739 --> 00:46:35,740
Golly'll be okay.

777
00:46:35,741 --> 00:46:38,076
I know.

778
00:47:16,949 --> 00:47:18,884
You're not selling?

779
00:47:18,885 --> 00:47:20,718
Sorry,
change of heart.

780
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:22,888
We decided the old guy
had been here for so long

781
00:47:22,889 --> 00:47:25,123
it wouldn't be fair
to send him packing.

782
00:47:25,124 --> 00:47:28,760
I know you don't put much value on history
and tradition, Mr. Carter, but we do.

783
00:47:28,761 --> 00:47:32,931
- I can understand why you feel that way.
- You can?

784
00:47:32,932 --> 00:47:35,967
Without all that stuff, there's
very little point to you, is there?

785
00:47:35,968 --> 00:47:38,403
<i>I'm thinking of getting out
of the heritage business,</i>

786
00:47:38,404 --> 00:47:42,073
see if I can't make a splash with
something more modern. Is your mother about?

787
00:47:44,377 --> 00:47:46,778
Talking to you last
night got me thinking.

788
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:50,282
Blake, Yoko Ono, your pal
Hockney, that's the stuff I love.

789
00:47:50,283 --> 00:47:53,184
So I've decided I'm going
to put on a '60s exhibition.

790
00:47:53,185 --> 00:47:55,820
I'm going to call it "The
Fine and the Divine Decade. "

791
00:47:55,821 --> 00:47:57,722
And you want me
to come along?

792
00:47:57,723 --> 00:47:59,824
Aye, I thought you
might say a few words

793
00:47:59,825 --> 00:48:02,394
since you've been there,
done that, got the t-shirt.

794
00:48:02,395 --> 00:48:04,529
Oh, I never wore
t- shirts, Mr. Carter.

795
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:06,464
In fact, there were
quite a few parties

796
00:48:06,465 --> 00:48:08,766
where one wore
nothing at all.

797
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:12,703
- I'll be delighted to come.
- Think you'll be able to get your hands on work like that?

798
00:48:12,704 --> 00:48:15,373
<i>- Surely it's all in private collections.
- it's not a sale.</i>

799
00:48:15,374 --> 00:48:18,109
Collectors are quite good
about loaning out their work

800
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:20,745
if they know you're not
out to make a fast buck.

801
00:48:20,746 --> 00:48:23,949
And you'll cover
her expenses, naturally?

802
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:26,017
And a few quid
for her trouble?

803
00:48:26,018 --> 00:48:28,786
<i>I think we can manage that.
In fact, Mrs. MacDonald,</i>

804
00:48:28,787 --> 00:48:31,423
I may be able to throw
more that a few quid your way.

805
00:48:31,424 --> 00:48:35,460
I'm particularly interested in any paintings
you might have done back in the '60s.

806
00:48:35,461 --> 00:48:38,896
You, too? That smartly-dressed
young man I met last night

807
00:48:38,897 --> 00:48:41,666
called this morning and
asked the very same thing.

808
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:44,436
Why don't I show you
some of my early work?

809
00:48:44,437 --> 00:48:46,671
And then the bidding war
can begin.

810
00:48:48,874 --> 00:48:51,676
Molly gets her cash,
Carter gets the paintings

811
00:48:51,677 --> 00:48:54,479
and we get to keep Cuthbert,
so everybody's happy.

812
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,349
No, not everyone actually.
I've always hated that painting.

813
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:00,618
It used to give me nightmares. Gives
me the creeps just thinking about it.

814
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:02,487
( laughing )

815
00:49:02,488 --> 00:49:04,722
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

816
00:49:04,723 --> 00:49:06,191
What?

817
00:49:12,131 --> 00:49:14,366
( snickers )

818
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:16,367
