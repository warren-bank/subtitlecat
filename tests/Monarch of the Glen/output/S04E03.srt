1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,734
Lexie! oh!

2
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:08,503
Is it that bad?

3
00:00:08,504 --> 00:00:11,038
No, I'm not meant
to see the bride

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,040
before the big day.

5
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:15,643
That's the groom,
you loon.

6
00:00:15,644 --> 00:00:18,480
Anyway, I'm not getting married
for another two weeks.

7
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:20,682
So, what do you think?

8
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:23,751
I wanted something
simple and elegant.

9
00:00:23,752 --> 00:00:25,453
<i>It looks great.</i>

10
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:30,725
Dead sexy.

11
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:33,828
Duncan, you think underwear
catalogs are dead sexy.

12
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:37,131
No, really.

13
00:00:37,132 --> 00:00:39,400
You're beautiful.

14
00:00:41,336 --> 00:00:43,104
Thanks.

15
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:46,541
Anyway, the minister's
here for the arrangements.

16
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:48,275
Oh, already?

17
00:00:48,276 --> 00:00:50,211
Duncan...

18
00:00:51,547 --> 00:00:53,781
this is the bit you're
not supposed to see.

19
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,787
( giggles )

20
00:00:59,788 --> 00:01:01,723
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

21
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:37,692
So, do you miss
Glasgow much?

22
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:39,694
Ach, no. I had
to leave after

23
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:41,596
they caught me flogging
the candlesticks.

24
00:01:41,597 --> 00:01:44,432
Joke.

25
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:46,100
<i>Lexie: hi.</i>

26
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:48,236
Hi, sorry to keep
you waiting, Reverend.

27
00:01:48,237 --> 00:01:50,338
Not Reverend-
Alice, please.

28
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:52,841
You must be
very excited, Lexie.

29
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:55,043
Yeah, I might even
turn up this time.

30
00:01:55,044 --> 00:01:57,145
Well, that's always
a good start.

31
00:01:57,146 --> 00:01:59,280
- Please.
- Thank you.

32
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:03,217
Now, what sort of a service
did you have in mind?

33
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:05,887
I don't know,
something traditional.

34
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:08,957
What, love, honor
and obey, you mean?

35
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,792
Well, love and honor
anyway.

36
00:02:10,793 --> 00:02:12,861
You could make up
your own vows.

37
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:15,296
- Why don't we do that?
- I don't know about that.

38
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:17,298
But you want it down
by the loch?

39
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:19,500
Just a few guests,
nothing too grand.

40
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:21,803
Apart from the marquee,
of course.

41
00:02:21,804 --> 00:02:23,104
For the pipe band.

42
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:26,708
The pipe band?

43
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:29,945
And there'll be highland games
and a string quartet in the house.

44
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:32,280
A full MacDonald
clan gathering in fact.

45
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:34,783
<i>Just a wee bit
grand then?</i>

46
00:02:34,784 --> 00:02:37,351
Just a couple hundred
of our closest friends.

47
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:39,621
Surprise!

48
00:02:39,622 --> 00:02:43,458
What happened to intimate and
homely and small and special?

49
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:46,027
But it will be special.
It will be magnificent.

50
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:49,163
<i>It'll be a huge celebration
of a momentous day.</i>

51
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:52,500
Otherwise we might as well have a
quick snog in the registry office

52
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,502
and nip out for a curry.
( laughing )

53
00:02:55,972 --> 00:02:57,806
You tell her, Alice.

54
00:02:57,807 --> 00:03:00,809
<i>I can't tell you what sort
of a wedding to have.</i>

55
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,911
I can tell you
that whatever you choose,

56
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:04,746
it has to be something
you both want-

57
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:06,615
<i>with all your heart.</i>

58
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,852
Why don't I come back
in a day or two, hmm?

59
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:15,724
- Yeah, thanks.
- Goodbye now.

60
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:17,525
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

61
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:28,703
<i>( horn blows )</i>

62
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:35,910
Ah, well,
there we are.

63
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:38,246
Molly:
Louis, you found us!

64
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:40,548
Molly, my darling.

65
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:44,085
I was afraid I'd
run out of petrol

66
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:45,854
and get eaten
by wolves.

67
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:48,289
Oh, our wolves are quite
fussy about their diet.

68
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,825
Archie, this is
a very old friend

69
00:03:50,826 --> 00:03:52,894
of Hector's and mine,
Louis Grimshaw.

70
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:54,495
This is my son,
Archie.

71
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,699
Your son,
why, surely not.

72
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,535
How do you do it,
my darling?

73
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:02,937
- I'm pleased to meet you.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

74
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:05,339
You're a very lucky man
with your mother's looks

75
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,143
and your father's castle.

76
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:10,912
Louis, Hector and I spent
a lot of our youth together

77
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:12,647
in London
back in the '60s.

78
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:16,517
All those wild parties, you
know. Fast cars, high times.

79
00:04:16,518 --> 00:04:19,487
The rest of the days
we just wasted.

80
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:21,389
Let me get your bag.

81
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,125
Careful, it's a very
valuable antique,

82
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:27,095
<i>- rather like myself.
- ( laughing )</i>

83
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:29,130
Listen, old thing,

84
00:04:29,131 --> 00:04:31,766
I'm dreadfully sorry
about Hector.

85
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:34,169
All these years I've
been meaning to visit

86
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,270
but I just
left it too late.

87
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:38,206
I'm deeply ashamed.

88
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:39,774
Never mind,
you're here now

89
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:43,011
- and we're very pleased to see you.
- Oh, good.

90
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:46,347
( mimicking gunfire ) I'm
getting readings from all over!

91
00:04:46,348 --> 00:04:48,482
They're coming out
of the walls!

92
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:51,753
Could I have my plasma rifle please?

93
00:04:53,222 --> 00:04:56,091
- Sorry.
- What is that thing anyway?

94
00:04:56,092 --> 00:04:58,226
This? It's a tracking device.

95
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:03,198
Great, could it track down the
socks the washing machine's eaten?

96
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,333
No, look,
it tracks this.

97
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:07,969
Long-range transponder,
state of the art.

98
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,739
We might use it on the
wolves when they go wild.

99
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,441
Archie asked me
to evaluate it for him.

100
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:17,278
I think we might want to try that
outside, in controlled conditions.

101
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,181
<i>- Okay, Arch, yeah.
- my mother's guest has arrived.</i>

102
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:22,550
I was wondering if you
can rustle up some tea?

103
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:24,352
<i>- Consider it rustled.
- Thank you.</i>

104
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:29,891
Have you talked
to Golly yet?

105
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:31,893
- About what?
- About another date.

106
00:05:31,894 --> 00:05:34,195
I feel bad that he
was stood up like that.

107
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:36,497
I didn't realize
I was standing him up.

108
00:05:36,498 --> 00:05:38,900
Oh, no, no, no,
it's just, well-

109
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:42,603
Golly's a great guy and
- well, you should get to know him.

110
00:05:42,604 --> 00:05:44,773
Give him another chance.

111
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:47,108
<i>Irene: I'm sure he's very nice.</i>

112
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:49,911
<i>He just seems a bit tweedy, that's all.</i>

113
00:05:49,912 --> 00:05:52,147
<i>( Duncan snickers )
Tweedy?</i>

114
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:53,748
<i>Irene: You know, countrified.</i>

115
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:55,683
Like he shaves
with broken glass.

116
00:05:55,684 --> 00:05:57,451
Keeps a ferret
in his sporran.

117
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:59,553
That's not a ferret
in his sporran,

118
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:01,522
he's just pleased
to see you.

119
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,232
- Who's the letter to?
- My mother.

120
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,601
I told her it would be
a low-key affair.

121
00:06:13,602 --> 00:06:17,272
Now she'll probably turn up in a
sedan chair carried by body builders.

122
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:18,806
Why not
just phone her?

123
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:20,474
This way she
can't interrupt me.

124
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:22,377
We're interviewing
new teachers

125
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:23,878
for the village school
in half an hour.

126
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,147
What do you want me to
do, check their spelling?

127
00:06:26,148 --> 00:06:28,216
The laird is on
the board of governors

128
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:30,351
and, since you'll
be the laird's wife,

129
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:31,986
it's kind of like
our civic duty.

130
00:06:31,987 --> 00:06:35,256
Oh, I see. So I'm meant to smile nicely

131
00:06:35,257 --> 00:06:37,158
and hand out
digestive biscuits.

132
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:39,560
And I thought being a
laird's wife would be boring.

133
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:41,729
I take it you're
not coming then?

134
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,465
Seeing as you're so good at
making arrangements by yourself.

135
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:45,666
Hmm.

136
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:52,540
Seems a bit presumptuous, me
chairing the board of governors

137
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,508
when I've only
been here a few weeks.

138
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:56,110
This lot won't give
you any trouble.

139
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:58,980
But there's a bullwhip under
your seat, just in case.

140
00:06:58,981 --> 00:07:01,682
- How's Lexie?
- She's great.

141
00:07:01,683 --> 00:07:04,152
I'll talk her round,
she'll be fine on the day.

142
00:07:04,153 --> 00:07:06,287
You sure about that?

143
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:08,289
I am going to marry
that girl

144
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,524
even if it means I have
to wheel her up the aisle

145
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:12,860
strapped to a trolley.
She is the one for me,

146
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:14,762
the only one there
ever has been.

147
00:07:14,763 --> 00:07:17,631
<i>- ( door opens )
- Looks like our first candidate's arrived.</i>

148
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:22,070
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

149
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:23,571
<i>Alice:
How you you do?</i>

150
00:07:23,572 --> 00:07:25,306
<i>Thank you so much
for coming.</i>

151
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:27,008
<i>Will you take
a seat?</i>

152
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,894
Hello, Archie.

153
00:07:48,497 --> 00:07:50,431
<i>So, Miss Finlay,</i>

154
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:53,334
I understand you used
to be head teacher here.

155
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:55,936
Yes, up until
about a year ago.

156
00:08:03,445 --> 00:08:05,913
( clears throat )

157
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:08,449
So what were the other
candidates like?

158
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,284
I'm sure I'm not
supposed to tell you that.

159
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:12,820
Come on, it's me. Don't
get all ethical on me.

160
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:15,656
How the hell are you? Why didn't
you tell me you were coming?

161
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:17,392
Would you have
turned up if I had?

162
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:19,494
Of course I would,
it's great to see you.

163
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:21,695
I believe congratulations are in order.

164
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:23,998
- Sorry?
- You and Lexie.

165
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:26,134
Oh, right, yes, of course. Thank you.

166
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:28,036
How does
the old song go?

167
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:31,172
If you can't be with the one you
love, love the one you're with?

168
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:33,508
- So, where are you staying?
- The B and B.

169
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:36,344
Ah, yes, with the salty bacon
and the cardboard sausages.

170
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:38,612
We could have put you up
at the house, you know.

171
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:40,714
I don't think so,
Archie.

172
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:44,419
Yes. I take it the political
job didn't work out.

173
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,522
No. I got tired of all the
backstabbing and betrayal.

174
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:50,858
I guess I thought things would
be different at Glenbogle.

175
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:52,626
Silly me.

176
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:54,728
Katrina, you got
a better offer.

177
00:08:54,729 --> 00:08:57,565
We talked about it, you
left. I thought it was over.

178
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:00,234
It was. It is.

179
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:02,002
Well, good. So you can come to supper.

180
00:09:02,003 --> 00:09:04,072
- I don't know-
- oh, come on.

181
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:06,207
We're all grown ups.
It's in the past.

182
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,976
Everyone would love to see you
- mother, Golly, Duncan.

183
00:09:08,977 --> 00:09:10,478
And Lexie?

184
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:12,746
Yeah, and Lexie.

185
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:16,317
Unless you'd rather eat half-cooked
oven chips in front of the telly.

186
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:18,219
Depends what's on.

187
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,021
So, we'll say 6:30
for 7:00, shall we?

188
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:26,594
<i>( blues music playing )</i>

189
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:47,081
<i> nobody </i>

190
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:50,318
<i>is gonna tell me that
you don't love me, baby </i>

191
00:09:52,887 --> 00:09:55,490
<i> they just don't know </i>

192
00:09:55,491 --> 00:10:00,928
<i> that you're an angel </i>

193
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:04,732
<i> sent down from heaven </i>

194
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:09,003
<i> nobody </i>

195
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:12,240
<i> is gonna tell me that
you don't love me, baby... </i>

196
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:15,042
- Golly!
- Hi there.

197
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:25,119
- Where did you get it?
- Came free in a packet of cornflakes.

198
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,655
- Where do you think?
- She is gorgeous.

199
00:10:27,656 --> 00:10:30,525
- She is, isn't she?
- An M.G.B. Roadster

200
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:33,394
with the original chrome
and the wire wheels.

201
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:35,729
I had no idea
you were into cars.

202
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,299
Maybe there's more to me
than meets the eye.

203
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,536
There's more to this than meets
the eye. This is full of filler.

204
00:10:41,537 --> 00:10:44,772
It's not the bodywork, son, it's
what under the bonnet that counts.

205
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:46,974
Fancy a wee spin?

206
00:10:46,975 --> 00:10:49,677
Oh, I would love to but
I've got too much to do.

207
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:51,646
Okay, after work.

208
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:53,414
Take her for a burn
as they say?

209
00:10:53,415 --> 00:10:55,449
Okay, you're on.

210
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,385
Good.

211
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:04,225
I'm sorry, Duncan, but they
didn't have any four-seaters left.

212
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:17,171
- Hi.
- Hello.

213
00:11:17,172 --> 00:11:19,240
Archie invited me
to dinner.

214
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:21,409
Did he not tell you?

215
00:11:22,611 --> 00:11:24,378
Funnily enough, no.

216
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:27,848
<i>- Well, don't go to any trouble.
- I won't.</i>

217
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:32,553
I mean... I'm not
the housekeeper anymore.

218
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:34,622
I forgot,
you've been promoted.

219
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:36,624
<i>Well, I hope
you're happy.</i>

220
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:40,361
<i>- Meaning?
- what I said.</i>

221
00:11:40,362 --> 00:11:42,196
I hope you and Archie
will be happy.

222
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:45,299
So, what are you
doing here then?

223
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,934
Does my being here
bother you?

224
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,405
- Should it?
- Not if Archie loves you, no.

225
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:53,574
There's no ifs
about it, Katrina.

226
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:56,076
Ah, ladies,
you've found each other.

227
00:11:56,077 --> 00:11:58,512
I've invited Katrina
to... supper.

228
00:11:58,513 --> 00:12:00,381
I'd heard.

229
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:04,885
Yeah, she's hoping
to come back to Glenbogle.

230
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:07,688
Looks like she's made it.

231
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:13,327
I just thought
it would be nice.

232
00:12:13,328 --> 00:12:16,196
<i>Molly: ... buzz to have
a flutter on the gee-gees.</i>

233
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:18,031
Louis: Only when you win, old girl.

234
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:19,867
I would have
wasted less dosh

235
00:12:19,868 --> 00:12:22,202
if I'd bought a racehorse and shot it.

236
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:25,939
Oh, Katrina,
what a surprise.

237
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,175
- Hello, Molly.
- Katrina, this is Louis.

238
00:12:28,176 --> 00:12:31,279
<i>- Katrina used to teach at our local school.
- Louis: really?</i>

239
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,914
<i>So, Lexie's invited you to
supper, that's wonderful.</i>

240
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:37,618
<i>- I'm not sure if I'm gonna stay.
- Molly: you must, I insist.</i>

241
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:39,687
I want to hear
all your news.

242
00:12:42,056 --> 00:12:43,857
Oh, dear.

243
00:12:43,858 --> 00:12:46,527
You need to turn
the heating up, old boy.

244
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:49,129
It's distinctly
chilly in here.

245
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:54,368
What's the matter?

246
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:56,970
Do the girls not go
for medallion man?

247
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:02,209
Maybe you should
buy a car.

248
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,012
( sniffs )

249
00:13:05,013 --> 00:13:08,382
Ah, you dirty-

250
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:20,194
Rabbie?

251
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,997
Rabbie! come on.

252
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:26,367
( panting )
Good bunny.

253
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:31,972
Go ahead, run.

254
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:35,810
No one escapes
from Glenbogle.

255
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,114
Look, Lex,
I'm really sorry.

256
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:44,184
I thought it would
clear the air.

257
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:48,088
I used to think you
knew nothing about women.

258
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,425
It was kind of cute.

259
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:55,095
Now I think you line us up
like wine-glasses

260
00:13:55,096 --> 00:13:57,398
- so you can play a wee tune.
- Come on.

261
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,368
You've been doing it for years.
Keeping your women guessing.

262
00:14:00,369 --> 00:14:02,269
Keeping us on our toes.

263
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,338
I was just trying
to be polite.

264
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:06,474
Oh, right,
so I suppose now

265
00:14:06,475 --> 00:14:08,376
you're gonna politely
drive her home.

266
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:11,579
Unless you'd
rather do it.

267
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:23,323
( sighs )

268
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:26,861
Golly: Yeah, that one there
is the Mountain of the Eagles

269
00:14:26,862 --> 00:14:29,530
and the range next
to it is the Cairngorms.

270
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:32,065
Irene: I love the way
the sky goes on forever.

271
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:34,334
You wait until you
see the Perseids.

272
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:36,136
- The who?
- The perseids.

273
00:14:36,137 --> 00:14:39,239
It's a meteor shower.
Be happening any day now.

274
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,542
I'll have to take
the washing in now.

275
00:14:41,543 --> 00:14:45,112
And I thought the only entertainment
up here was shooting things.

276
00:14:45,113 --> 00:14:47,515
You can laugh,
but I heard

277
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:50,117
that there was a barn
dance down Taggart's Glen.

278
00:14:50,118 --> 00:14:52,520
A barn dance?

279
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:55,423
Won't I need a gingham dress
and some straw in my hair?

280
00:14:55,424 --> 00:14:58,459
It's a barn dance, the
straw will be provided.

281
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:01,829
( tracker beeping )

282
00:15:06,301 --> 00:15:08,569
( faster beeping )

283
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,538
Got you.

284
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,338
<i>( techno music playing )</i>

285
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:47,307
Irene: Now this is what
I call a highland fling.

286
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:49,777
Are you coming?

287
00:15:50,812 --> 00:15:53,681
Ah, to hell with it.
Let's go.

288
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,760
Good night, Archie.
Thanks for the lift.

289
00:16:08,897 --> 00:16:10,430
Good night, Katrina.

290
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:24,344
Nice evening?

291
00:16:27,181 --> 00:16:29,282
It would have been
nicer if you'd been there.

292
00:16:29,283 --> 00:16:32,319
( scoffs ) Oh aye, the
laird and his harem.

293
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,688
Archie's not like that.

294
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:38,258
- I know him better than you.
- Then why don't you trust him, Lexie?

295
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:45,966
Are you here
to get him back?

296
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:49,102
He's made it pretty
clear he's not available.

297
00:16:49,103 --> 00:16:51,805
Just like a politician
- can't answer a straight question.

298
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:58,478
Go on then, have a go.
If you think you're cute enough.

299
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,648
Lexie, you're getting
married in two weeks.

300
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:02,983
Maybe.

301
00:17:02,984 --> 00:17:06,253
But I won't let any man play
stupid games with my feelings.

302
00:17:20,268 --> 00:17:22,302
( groans )

303
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:24,104
So, how was it?

304
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:25,706
Brilliant.

305
00:17:25,707 --> 00:17:27,741
You'll have to speak up,
my ears are ringing.

306
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:31,178
- I was getting worried.
- We went clubbing.

307
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,448
Clubbing?!

308
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:37,384
Yeah, those baby seals
really take it out of you.

309
00:17:37,385 --> 00:17:39,753
You do know that Irene's
got to be up at 6:30?

310
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:43,223
Duncan, you're
like my mother.

311
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:46,827
All you need is the fluffy
slippers and the hairnet.

312
00:17:48,262 --> 00:17:49,997
Good night.

313
00:18:01,676 --> 00:18:04,644
You came home
late last night.

314
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:08,048
I went for a walk.
Up to the village.

315
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:12,820
The village?

316
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:15,088
You know, if you'd
wanted to talk to Katrina,

317
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:16,924
you could have
done it at supper.

318
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:19,993
With a knife in my hand? Bad idea.

319
00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:21,962
Mmm.

320
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:28,969
So, did you
sort things out?

321
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,972
Oh, yeah. We're all
gonna become Mormons.

322
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:34,374
Then you can have
as many wives as you like.

323
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:39,813
You know, Lex, there's nothing going
on between me and Katrina anymore.

324
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:41,915
What do I have to do
to persuade you of that?

325
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,684
Simple.
Send her back.

326
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:47,187
Send her
- I'm the Laird of Glenbogle,

327
00:18:47,188 --> 00:18:49,723
<i>- not the czar of all the Russias.
- ( knocking )</i>

328
00:18:49,724 --> 00:18:53,160
Sorry, Irene said you were
here. Is this a good time?

329
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:54,694
- Archie: No.
- Yeah.

330
00:18:54,695 --> 00:18:57,664
- No.
- Yes, yes, of course.

331
00:18:57,665 --> 00:18:59,733
It's about
the teaching post.

332
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:03,136
Basically the board is
split down the middle.

333
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:05,538
Three of us want
Katrina Finlay.

334
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:07,040
And the other three?

335
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,042
They have some doubts
about her commitment.

336
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:13,480
<i>- which means...
- it's down to me.</i>

337
00:19:13,481 --> 00:19:15,682
<i>Have you made
your decision yet?</i>

338
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,022
It's about what's best
for the school, Lex.

339
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:24,324
Of course it is.

340
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:26,026
Excuse me.

341
00:19:28,696 --> 00:19:31,498
We'll need to know
by tomorrow morning.

342
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:34,234
<i>- ( door shuts )
- Yeah, you will.</i>

343
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:46,046
Are you spying on me?

344
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,481
Just posting
some letters.

345
00:19:48,482 --> 00:19:52,252
<i>- you going out?
- I was just gonna take a look around the village.</i>

346
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:54,487
I'd forgotten how much
I miss this place.

347
00:19:54,488 --> 00:19:57,024
- If you come back then-
- and am I?

348
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:58,959
Coming back?

349
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:03,363
The board of governors
likes you.

350
00:20:03,364 --> 00:20:05,365
Well, half of them.

351
00:20:05,366 --> 00:20:08,435
The other half doubt
your commitment.

352
00:20:08,436 --> 00:20:10,737
And what about you?

353
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:13,373
You're a wonderful
teacher.

354
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:15,775
Are you really here
for the job?

355
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:19,246
Well, I was.

356
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:21,614
At least I was when
I applied for the job.

357
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:25,385
Then I saw you
at the interview and...

358
00:20:25,386 --> 00:20:28,388
I realize I've been
kidding myself.

359
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:30,457
I love you, Archie.

360
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:34,394
I never stopped
loving you.

361
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:37,730
I can't believe we
threw away what we had.

362
00:20:37,731 --> 00:20:40,334
And I don't believe
it's over.

363
00:20:40,335 --> 00:20:42,669
I know you feel the same,

364
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,537
admit it.

365
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:47,040
No, Katrina.

366
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,242
Then tell me you don't.

367
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:52,879
Lexie doesn't trust you.
She says you're playing games-

368
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,482
- Please, I'm gonna marry Lexie.
- When?

369
00:20:55,483 --> 00:20:57,484
How do you know
she'll even turn up.

370
00:20:57,485 --> 00:21:00,187
When has she ever shown
her full commitment?

371
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:02,055
I would.

372
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:04,324
I have.

373
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:06,493
I'd give up everything.

374
00:21:06,494 --> 00:21:09,229
All you have to do
is ask.

375
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,298
Katrina, you left.

376
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:13,433
We all make
mistakes, Archie.

377
00:21:13,434 --> 00:21:15,869
It's not too late
to fix it.

378
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:20,440
Please, this isn't fair.
Not on any of us.

379
00:21:40,761 --> 00:21:42,795
<i>( sobbing )</i>

380
00:21:42,796 --> 00:21:44,597
<i>Lexie?</i>

381
00:21:44,598 --> 00:21:46,733
What's the matter?

382
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:53,840
- You used to fancy me, didn't you?
- Is this a trick question?

383
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:56,343
Would you still have me

384
00:21:56,344 --> 00:21:59,246
<i>if I left Archie?</i>

385
00:21:59,247 --> 00:22:01,114
If you left-

386
00:22:01,115 --> 00:22:03,383
what are you
talking about?

387
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:06,253
Now that Katrina's here...

388
00:22:06,254 --> 00:22:09,289
it's like he's selling hisself
short by marrying me.

389
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,525
( relieved sigh )

390
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,228
Don't talk
rubbish, woman.

391
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:19,566
<i>Of course I fanc-
I still do fancy you,</i>

392
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:22,835
and the Lexie I fancied
wouldn't give up without a fight.

393
00:22:24,138 --> 00:22:26,606
What do you want
me and Katrina to do?

394
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:29,443
( chuckles ) Strip to
the waist and slug it out?

395
00:22:31,412 --> 00:22:33,213
No.

396
00:22:33,214 --> 00:22:36,149
<i>And listen, Katrina's not your problem,</i>

397
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,118
<i>you are.</i>

398
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:41,754
You're still wearing the rubber gloves
in here. You're not a housekeeper.

399
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,126
<i>You're Lexie,</i>

400
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:48,128
queen of Glenbogle!

401
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:50,363
And Archie loves you
and you deserve it

402
00:22:50,364 --> 00:22:52,065
and you deserve him!

403
00:22:57,338 --> 00:22:58,938
If you're chasing women

404
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:01,208
<i>you'll need a bigger net
than that.</i>

405
00:23:03,677 --> 00:23:05,945
My money's on you.

406
00:23:10,251 --> 00:23:11,851
No contest.

407
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:14,854
<i>And Lexie,</i>

408
00:23:14,855 --> 00:23:17,524
if you do go
for the topless...

409
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:19,593
bare-knuckle thing,

410
00:23:19,594 --> 00:23:21,595
don't start
without us, will you?

411
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:34,207
I had a daughter,

412
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:37,310
but I never knew what
that meant until I met her.

413
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:40,547
Well, I'm making up
for lost time.

414
00:23:40,548 --> 00:23:43,150
What about yourself?

415
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:44,951
What about me?

416
00:23:44,952 --> 00:23:46,786
You must have a family.

417
00:23:46,787 --> 00:23:49,523
Unless you rose up
out of the sea like that

418
00:23:49,524 --> 00:23:51,458
what's-her-name, Venus,
in the painting.

419
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:53,560
I did actually.
It was freezing.

420
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:55,895
( kids laughing loudly )

421
00:23:55,896 --> 00:23:58,931
Excuse me, we're trying
to have a conversation.

422
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:01,934
- Could you just lower your voice?
- All right, granddad.

423
00:24:01,935 --> 00:24:05,705
If he takes his teeth out,
I'm really in trouble, eh?

424
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:07,274
Shall we go?

425
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:11,278
Golly:
So, where do you fancy?

426
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,780
How about the seaside?

427
00:24:13,781 --> 00:24:16,449
The seaside.
Excellent idea.

428
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,850
Good.

429
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:22,889
Look, I thought he'd have one of
those wee electric wheelchairs.

430
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,059
Just be careful you don't get your
hands dirty pushing that heap home.

431
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,462
This is a turbo-charged
XR3i, pal.

432
00:24:29,463 --> 00:24:33,466
- You can't even spell XR3i.
- I'd be 30 miles down the road

433
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:35,535
while you're still looking
for your starting handle.

434
00:24:35,536 --> 00:24:38,371
- Fancy a wee bet?
- Golly, let's just go.

435
00:24:38,372 --> 00:24:40,373
Aye, 10 quid against
your bus pass?

436
00:24:40,374 --> 00:24:42,475
No, winner takes
the keys, son.

437
00:24:42,476 --> 00:24:45,278
Away, if I need a skip
I'll hire one.

438
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,014
Come on,
it's worth a few grand.

439
00:24:48,015 --> 00:24:50,684
Enough anyway to get somebody
to sort your acne out for you.

440
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:52,252
( laughing )

441
00:24:54,121 --> 00:24:56,155
First one
to the speed limit sign.

442
00:24:56,156 --> 00:24:57,824
Fine.

443
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,835
Golly, this is insane.

444
00:25:08,836 --> 00:25:11,003
I don't want to end up
walking home.

445
00:25:11,004 --> 00:25:12,872
Come on, Irene,
get in.

446
00:25:12,873 --> 00:25:14,507
You need
a good-looking woman

447
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:16,710
in the passenger seat
for this sort of thing.

448
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,484
Look, you can't do this.

449
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:27,019
It's not only dangerous,
it's stupid and illegal.

450
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,156
<i>Aye, but the police aren't
gonna catch me, are they?</i>

451
00:25:30,157 --> 00:25:31,891
Look, what are you
trying to prove,

452
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:33,793
that you're just
as daft as he is?

453
00:25:33,794 --> 00:25:36,296
Look, missus, tell your
dad to get in his car

454
00:25:36,297 --> 00:25:38,365
'cause I've got
places to be.

455
00:25:38,366 --> 00:25:41,200
Do him a favor. Don't you ride with him.

456
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:43,603
All that extra weight
won't help.

457
00:25:43,604 --> 00:25:47,206
You mind you don't wrap
yourself round a lamppost, eh?

458
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,547
Pimply little maggot.

459
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:56,349
Just make sure
you burn him.

460
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,851
- Right. After three.
- Okay.

461
00:25:58,852 --> 00:26:00,987
One, two, three.

462
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,659
( engine stalling )

463
00:26:37,124 --> 00:26:39,058
Keys.

464
00:26:42,062 --> 00:26:44,664
If you can find them,
you can keep them.

465
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:49,402
Have a nice day.

466
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:51,304
What are you
standing there for?

467
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:56,810
I can't believe
your luck.

468
00:26:56,811 --> 00:26:59,312
That's very shrewd
of you.

469
00:27:04,918 --> 00:27:07,420
Age and treachery
will always triumph

470
00:27:07,421 --> 00:27:09,556
over youth
and horsepower.

471
00:27:17,198 --> 00:27:18,831
<i>( door opens )</i>

472
00:27:28,242 --> 00:27:30,910
What are all these?

473
00:27:30,911 --> 00:27:33,279
Last minute arrangements
for the wedding.

474
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,581
I was supposed to have
confirmed them days ago.

475
00:27:35,582 --> 00:27:37,250
Well, you'd better hurry
up then, hadn't you?

476
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:42,322
So, you're up for it, are you,
marching bands and all?

477
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,493
- Of course.
- Why?

478
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:50,397
What do you mean, why?

479
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:52,965
<i>I want whatever
makes you happy.</i>

480
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:56,836
I don't know what
I want anymore.

481
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,674
Or who you want,
you mean.

482
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:04,110
That's not what I meant.

483
00:28:04,111 --> 00:28:07,147
What did she say then?
Katrina?

484
00:28:07,148 --> 00:28:09,649
Katrina?

485
00:28:12,553 --> 00:28:16,089
Katrina said that you
don't trust me anymore.

486
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,658
Is that true?

487
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:23,396
'Cause if it is, Lexie,
why would you want to marry me?

488
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:26,299
If it's just so you
can keep me on a leash

489
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,668
then it's not
gonna work, is it?

490
00:28:30,438 --> 00:28:32,705
No.

491
00:28:32,706 --> 00:28:34,941
But let's face it,

492
00:28:34,942 --> 00:28:36,909
it was never
gonna work, was it?

493
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:03,336
Ahh!

494
00:29:11,212 --> 00:29:13,079
( yells )

495
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:30,029
( cawing )

496
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:33,933
Okay, birdie, back off.

497
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:35,801
Drop it. leave it.

498
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,871
Shoo...

499
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:40,940
hey, that's not fair!

500
00:29:42,776 --> 00:29:46,179
No, that's not fair!

501
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,324
<i>( crow cawing )</i>

502
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:30,490
I don't suppose it's
easy being the laird.

503
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:34,360
Thousands of acres, hundreds
of tenants, dozens of staff.

504
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:36,062
Well, us three.

505
00:30:36,063 --> 00:30:38,831
That lot I can manage.

506
00:30:38,832 --> 00:30:41,301
That woman who came
to dinner last night,

507
00:30:41,302 --> 00:30:44,003
she wasn't just the
village teacher, was she?

508
00:30:44,004 --> 00:30:45,771
Was it that obvious?

509
00:30:45,772 --> 00:30:48,441
She hardly touched her food
and it wasn't my cooking.

510
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:53,045
Why didn't I just
listen to Lexie?

511
00:30:53,046 --> 00:30:55,315
A nice simple service.

512
00:30:55,316 --> 00:30:57,883
Sign here, she'll do for
me, everyone off to the pub.

513
00:30:57,884 --> 00:31:00,086
That wouldn't have
changed anything.

514
00:31:00,087 --> 00:31:02,822
It's not the ceremony,
it's what it means.

515
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:07,927
Katrina used to be
the world to me

516
00:31:07,928 --> 00:31:11,564
and then Lexie was- is.

517
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,403
And now between love and duty,
loyalty and friendship,

518
00:31:17,404 --> 00:31:19,872
I don't know what to do.

519
00:31:19,873 --> 00:31:22,642
Whatever you do
will hurt someone.

520
00:31:22,643 --> 00:31:25,745
Yeah, but doing nothing
will hurt everyone.

521
00:31:25,746 --> 00:31:28,414
Maybe you should
just do the right thing.

522
00:31:34,421 --> 00:31:36,356
Morning, Duncan.

523
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:40,360
- How was your evening?
- Oh, fantastic.

524
00:31:40,361 --> 00:31:43,863
Golly got into a rumble with
some punk in a hot hatch.

525
00:31:43,864 --> 00:31:45,965
It was like
"Rebel Without a Cause. "

526
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:48,033
That's nice.

527
00:31:48,034 --> 00:31:50,770
So you'll be heading out
again this evening?

528
00:31:50,771 --> 00:31:53,973
Well, we-
do you want to join us?

529
00:31:53,974 --> 00:31:55,742
What, stuffed
in the boot?

530
00:31:55,743 --> 00:31:58,478
No thanks. I think I'll
just head up to the village

531
00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:01,247
- on my bike- fancy a ride
on a crossbar? - Duncan...

532
00:32:01,248 --> 00:32:03,516
Golly and I, we're just
having a bit of fun.

533
00:32:03,517 --> 00:32:06,952
<i>Oh, right, and have
you told him that?</i>

534
00:32:08,622 --> 00:32:11,257
- Oh, Eileen is it?
- Irene.

535
00:32:11,258 --> 00:32:13,259
Oh, well, whatever.

536
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,663
Just caught this in that
big puddle out in front.

537
00:32:16,664 --> 00:32:18,931
Congratulations.
You want it stuffed?

538
00:32:18,932 --> 00:32:20,800
<i>Capital idea, yes.</i>

539
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:23,936
With almonds and coriander,
if you know what that is.

540
00:32:23,937 --> 00:32:25,571
<i>Well done, please.</i>

541
00:32:27,508 --> 00:32:29,676
I'm not into sushi.

542
00:32:32,245 --> 00:32:35,548
Almonds and coriander.
Strychnine more like.

543
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,351
Here, I'll do this.

544
00:32:41,388 --> 00:32:43,389
We didn't-

545
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,592
<i>I didn't mean to make
you feel left out.</i>

546
00:32:46,593 --> 00:32:48,628
Och, don't be daft.

547
00:32:48,629 --> 00:32:50,730
It's just my luck.

548
00:32:50,731 --> 00:32:53,399
I mean, I meet someone
that I really like

549
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,135
and fix them up with somebody
else that I really like,

550
00:32:56,136 --> 00:32:58,705
and they go out and have
a really good time,

551
00:32:58,706 --> 00:33:03,609
and I lose 2,000 quid's worth
of gadget in the loch.

552
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,611
My typical, rotten,

553
00:33:05,612 --> 00:33:07,747
lousy, useless-

554
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:14,253
looks like
your luck's changed.

555
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:23,596
<i>- Archie! - Lex, I've got to
go- board meeting in 10 minutes.</i>

556
00:33:23,597 --> 00:33:26,532
There's something that I
wanted to say to you last night.

557
00:33:28,035 --> 00:33:31,670
Look, I'm sorry that I've
given you such a hard time.

558
00:33:33,073 --> 00:33:36,242
I love you... and I
don't want to lose you.

559
00:33:36,243 --> 00:33:38,845
Let her go, Archie.

560
00:33:38,846 --> 00:33:41,680
And deny the school the
best teacher they could have

561
00:33:41,681 --> 00:33:43,616
just because
we've got problems?

562
00:33:43,617 --> 00:33:45,317
I know I'm
being paranoid

563
00:33:45,318 --> 00:33:47,120
but, as long
as she's around,

564
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:49,889
I'm always gonna feel
like second best.

565
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,058
Okay, so I send her away,

566
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:55,294
and what will you do the next
time an old flame pops up?

567
00:33:57,965 --> 00:34:00,499
She's not just an old
flame though, is she?

568
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,705
Lex, you have to trust me.

569
00:34:06,706 --> 00:34:08,775
Let her go

570
00:34:08,776 --> 00:34:10,843
and I promise-

571
00:34:10,844 --> 00:34:12,745
I'll trust you
forever.

572
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:23,555
I'll see you later,
okay?

573
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,433
<i>- Aye, aye.
- Irene: Hiya.</i>

574
00:34:34,434 --> 00:34:36,803
I'm thinking of giving
her a respray.

575
00:34:36,804 --> 00:34:38,971
<i>Something classy
and understated</i>

576
00:34:38,972 --> 00:34:42,508
like scarlet or lime
green. What do you think?

577
00:34:42,509 --> 00:34:44,476
I think it's not
the bodywork that counts,

578
00:34:44,477 --> 00:34:47,413
- it's what's under the bonnet.
- Oh, yes. Yes, yes.

579
00:34:47,414 --> 00:34:49,748
Thought maybe we could
take a drive

580
00:34:49,749 --> 00:34:53,085
<i>up to Plockton,
Applecross, lovely.</i>

581
00:34:53,086 --> 00:34:56,322
You know, drive up,
stay over somewhere.

582
00:34:56,323 --> 00:34:58,090
<i>Would you
mind if we-</i>

583
00:34:58,091 --> 00:35:00,827
eased off on the accelerator a bit?

584
00:35:00,828 --> 00:35:03,229
No, no, no,
not at all.

585
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,299
I suppose she does have
some miles on her, doesn't she?

586
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,167
No, Golly.

587
00:35:08,168 --> 00:35:11,170
She has loads of style
and she's a lovely mover,

588
00:35:11,171 --> 00:35:14,340
it's just the speed.

589
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:17,176
Well, do you fancy
a walk sometime then?

590
00:35:17,177 --> 00:35:19,511
Yeah, sometime.

591
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,858
I take it you
voted for me?

592
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:08,995
- Of course.
- Well, thanks for that.

593
00:36:08,996 --> 00:36:11,630
Oh please,
we're lucky to have you.

594
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:14,000
I can't stay
at the B and B forever

595
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:16,635
so I was thinking maybe I
could have my cottage back.

596
00:36:16,636 --> 00:36:18,637
Maybe you could come
to the housewarming.

597
00:36:18,638 --> 00:36:21,640
I'd love to.
I can't, sorry.

598
00:36:21,641 --> 00:36:25,211
You afraid people
might get the wrong idea?

599
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:28,447
<i>I'm afraid you might
get the wrong idea.</i>

600
00:36:29,816 --> 00:36:31,951
<i>Katrina, Lexie and I
are going to be married.</i>

601
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:35,788
What you and I had
was wonderful, but-

602
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:38,457
but note
the past tense.

603
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:40,092
I knew it.

604
00:36:41,328 --> 00:36:44,063
I knew I shouldn't but-

605
00:36:44,064 --> 00:36:46,832
I just kept thinking
maybe this once

606
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:50,202
I could turn
the clock back, you know?

607
00:36:50,203 --> 00:36:52,604
What an idiot.

608
00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:54,473
I'm sorry if I-

609
00:36:54,474 --> 00:36:56,475
<i>no, no, Archie,
don't.</i>

610
00:36:56,476 --> 00:36:58,644
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

611
00:36:58,645 --> 00:37:01,948
The advert didn't say
"salary according to scale

612
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:03,849
and old boyfriend
included. "

613
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,185
You'll find someone else.

614
00:37:06,186 --> 00:37:08,854
Do you know how long
it took me to find you?

615
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:14,327
I love-

616
00:37:14,328 --> 00:37:16,062
I love it here.

617
00:37:17,264 --> 00:37:19,698
<i>I love teaching.</i>

618
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:21,800
And I really want
to come back...

619
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,438
but if that means

620
00:37:25,439 --> 00:37:27,974
seeing you and Lexie
every day,

621
00:37:27,975 --> 00:37:30,943
<i>knowing that she's got
something that I'll never have,</i>

622
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:33,879
I can't.

623
00:37:35,015 --> 00:37:36,915
I just can't do it.

624
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:40,519
<i>- You don't mean...?
- thanks for the job offer</i>

625
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,489
but I won't be accepting.

626
00:37:49,062 --> 00:37:51,263
Oh, Archie, Archie.

627
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:06,979
<i>Duncan: Lexie!</i>

628
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,747
<i>Where you going?</i>

629
00:38:08,748 --> 00:38:11,250
Lexie, wait.

630
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:13,118
You're not
running off?

631
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,221
( tearfully )
No, I'm walking.

632
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:16,989
Don't just give up.

633
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,425
I told him I loved him
and it wasn't enough.

634
00:38:19,426 --> 00:38:21,494
I don't know
what else I can do.

635
00:38:21,495 --> 00:38:24,897
Try anything. Seduction,
blackmail, witchcraft.

636
00:38:24,898 --> 00:38:27,700
I wanted him to choose me. He didn't.

637
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:30,236
I blew it, Duncan.
I can't stay here.

638
00:38:30,237 --> 00:38:32,972
Lexie, hold on.

639
00:38:37,911 --> 00:38:40,012
I can't believe
you're going.

640
00:38:43,784 --> 00:38:45,752
Me neither.

641
00:38:45,753 --> 00:38:47,687
I'll call you
at your mum's, okay?

642
00:38:47,688 --> 00:38:50,322
Nice try, Dunc.

643
00:38:50,323 --> 00:38:54,560
Tell Archie not
to follow me, okay?

644
00:38:54,561 --> 00:38:56,596
Tell him-

645
00:38:56,597 --> 00:38:58,831
tell him I'm sorry
I messed him around.

646
00:38:58,832 --> 00:39:01,066
Lexie, I'll never
remember all that.

647
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:03,135
You tell him.

648
00:39:05,806 --> 00:39:07,740
Bye, Dunc.

649
00:39:20,587 --> 00:39:24,123
Oh, Golly, where's this hot
coupe I've been hearing about?

650
00:39:24,124 --> 00:39:27,126
I rather fancied seeing if
I could still leap into one.

651
00:39:27,127 --> 00:39:28,895
I'm afraid I got
rid of it, Molly.

652
00:39:28,896 --> 00:39:30,730
Oh no, but why?

653
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:32,965
A man my age,
an open-topped car,

654
00:39:32,966 --> 00:39:35,067
it's just a wee bit
pathetic, isn't it?

655
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:37,169
Yes, I suppose so.
There comes a time

656
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:40,072
when one has to settle for
something rather more sensible.

657
00:39:40,073 --> 00:39:44,009
- Exactly, which is why I got this instead.
- Oh!

658
00:39:46,012 --> 00:39:48,548
Twice the MPG,
more reliable,

659
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:50,182
far cheaper to run.

660
00:39:50,183 --> 00:39:52,852
<i>Of course,
and so practical.</i>

661
00:39:52,853 --> 00:39:54,854
And quite nippy
I should think.

662
00:39:54,855 --> 00:39:56,756
Nought to 60
in 4.7 seconds.

663
00:39:56,757 --> 00:40:00,359
Near enough pull your arms
out of your sockets, Molly.

664
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,463
Oh look, you've got
a spare helmet, I see.

665
00:40:09,135 --> 00:40:11,871
Oh, hello. I was looking for Lexie.

666
00:40:11,872 --> 00:40:14,974
Oh what,
the housekeeper?

667
00:40:14,975 --> 00:40:17,643
My employees always settled

668
00:40:17,644 --> 00:40:20,446
for a pat on the tush
and a mink coat.

669
00:40:20,447 --> 00:40:23,516
I was never so careless
as to get engaged.

670
00:40:25,486 --> 00:40:29,054
For a counter-jumper, Louis,
you're really quite a snob.

671
00:40:29,055 --> 00:40:31,757
Well, we all enjoy
a little fumble

672
00:40:31,758 --> 00:40:34,259
<i>below the stairs,
but a man of your position</i>

673
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,529
really ought
to marry money,

674
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:40,366
then you could hire as many
housekeepers as you like.

675
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:42,835
My father had a saying-

676
00:40:42,836 --> 00:40:47,072
"fish and visitors
go off after two days. "

677
00:40:47,073 --> 00:40:50,442
Your father, sayings
are about all he had.

678
00:40:50,443 --> 00:40:53,212
Right, pack your bags.

679
00:40:53,213 --> 00:40:55,414
The last thing my mother
needs is some clapped out

680
00:40:55,415 --> 00:40:57,583
Casanova messing about
with her feelings.

681
00:40:57,584 --> 00:40:59,318
<i>I'm not messing about,
old boy.</i>

682
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:01,821
My intentions
are strictly honorable.

683
00:41:01,822 --> 00:41:04,390
<i>That's what's bothering
you really, isn't it?</i>

684
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:05,858
<i>No more
playing the laird</i>

685
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:09,294
when I'm at the head
of the table.

686
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:11,764
Clearly you haven't
done your homework.

687
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:14,433
<i>'Cause even if my mother was
desperate enough to marry you,</i>

688
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:17,570
I would still be the laird and you
would still be Lord Louis of nowhere.

689
00:41:17,571 --> 00:41:20,406
Suits me. I don't
want everyone to know

690
00:41:20,407 --> 00:41:23,776
I'm marrying into a family
as dotty as the MacDonalds.

691
00:41:23,777 --> 00:41:26,211
Let's face it,
Hector didn't have

692
00:41:26,212 --> 00:41:28,313
many marbles
to pass on, did he?

693
00:41:28,314 --> 00:41:30,950
- Louis!
- Oh, darling-

694
00:41:30,951 --> 00:41:32,652
darling Molly,

695
00:41:32,653 --> 00:41:36,221
I didn't mean any disrespect to Hector,

696
00:41:36,222 --> 00:41:38,123
just that I envied him.

697
00:41:38,124 --> 00:41:41,060
<i>Snatching the most
beautiful girl in London</i>

698
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:43,062
from right under
my nose.

699
00:41:43,063 --> 00:41:46,398
<i>We'll have some fun.
You can't pretend</i>

700
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:50,903
you like being locked up
in this mausoleum.

701
00:41:50,904 --> 00:41:52,171
Okay, that's enough.

702
00:41:53,373 --> 00:41:56,008
We'll have some
laughs together.

703
00:41:56,009 --> 00:42:00,412
After all these years in exile
you deserve to be happy.

704
00:42:00,413 --> 00:42:04,116
Hector and I were happy! Happier than
a man like you could ever imagine.

705
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:05,818
<i>But look what
he left behind.</i>

706
00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:09,321
A mountain of debt,
a monument to dry rot

707
00:42:09,322 --> 00:42:11,757
and a huge smoking
hole in the ground.

708
00:42:11,758 --> 00:42:14,359
- Ooh!
- Ah- ow!

709
00:42:15,562 --> 00:42:17,129
( muffled growling )

710
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,067
Darling?

711
00:42:23,503 --> 00:42:25,404
Lex?

712
00:42:25,405 --> 00:42:27,339
Lexie?

713
00:42:35,181 --> 00:42:37,950
She's gone, Arch.

714
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,752
Gone? gone where?

715
00:42:39,753 --> 00:42:41,754
Over the hills.

716
00:42:41,755 --> 00:42:43,388
No.

717
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:45,625
No, no, no, no. That
wasn't meant to happen.

718
00:42:45,626 --> 00:42:47,793
<i>- What, you mean there was a plan?
- yeah!</i>

719
00:42:47,794 --> 00:42:50,195
- Why'd you let her go, Dunc?
- I didn't let her go.

720
00:42:51,665 --> 00:42:53,398
No, you're right,
I did.

721
00:42:54,534 --> 00:42:58,170
I've been such a fool!

722
00:42:58,171 --> 00:43:00,439
That's not what I mean.

723
00:43:22,428 --> 00:43:25,530
<i>( engines approaching )</i>

724
00:43:47,387 --> 00:43:49,221
How did you find me?

725
00:43:49,222 --> 00:43:52,457
- I followed my heart.
- Your heart?

726
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:54,426
I thought Katrina
had run off with it.

727
00:43:54,427 --> 00:43:56,195
She was too late.

728
00:43:56,196 --> 00:43:59,198
The only thing I could give
Katrina was a teaching job,

729
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:01,533
and as it happened, she
didn't want it so she's left.

730
00:44:03,203 --> 00:44:06,571
You had to do it
your way, didn't you?

731
00:44:06,572 --> 00:44:08,941
<i>I had to do
the right thing.</i>

732
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:13,512
I want you to trust me.

733
00:44:13,513 --> 00:44:15,214
If I'd sent
Katrina away,

734
00:44:15,215 --> 00:44:17,316
all it would prove
is that you couldn't.

735
00:44:17,317 --> 00:44:19,351
Now come home, please.

736
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:21,653
I won't marry you,
Archie.

737
00:44:21,654 --> 00:44:23,755
- Lexie.
- I can't.

738
00:44:23,756 --> 00:44:25,958
Not if it involves
marching bands

739
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:28,593
and haggis flinging and
me flashing my garters

740
00:44:28,594 --> 00:44:32,298
- at the whole Clan MacDonald.
- Don't tell me you want a quick little ceremony,

741
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:35,200
miles from anywhere, with all
the usual suspects as witnesses.

742
00:44:35,201 --> 00:44:38,870
Aye, I do.

743
00:44:38,871 --> 00:44:41,506
Fine.
Have it your way.

744
00:44:44,077 --> 00:44:46,145
<i>( car horn beeping )</i>

745
00:44:47,414 --> 00:44:49,881
Where did they come from?

746
00:44:51,251 --> 00:44:53,052
And who the hell
are those two?

747
00:44:57,623 --> 00:45:00,459
<i>- Thank you, Golly.
- My pleasure, Reverend.</i>

748
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:03,329
That was- whoo!

749
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,030
I don't believe it.

750
00:45:05,031 --> 00:45:07,399
Did somebody call
for a minister?

751
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,534
I wonder if you'd
care to marry us?

752
00:45:09,535 --> 00:45:11,270
Right here,
right now.

753
00:45:11,271 --> 00:45:14,139
No sky diving bagpipers,
just this rabble.

754
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,808
What about
the clan and-

755
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:19,144
they'll have their big day,
this one'll be ours.

756
00:45:19,145 --> 00:45:21,480
Well, the paperwork's
all sorted

757
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:23,182
but, before we proceed,

758
00:45:23,183 --> 00:45:25,517
we have to have
the consent of the bride.

759
00:45:25,518 --> 00:45:27,486
<i>Fully and freely given.</i>

760
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:30,122
Do you want
to do this, Lexie?

761
00:45:33,626 --> 00:45:36,261
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

762
00:45:36,262 --> 00:45:38,397
Very much so.

763
00:45:39,966 --> 00:45:41,867
Gather around.

764
00:45:41,868 --> 00:45:45,137
Wait, we've not went over the vows
or rehearsed the service or anything.

765
00:45:45,138 --> 00:45:47,006
We'll just make
it up as we go.

766
00:45:49,142 --> 00:45:51,210
Join hands now.

767
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,582
Alice: To seal your vows
in the presence of God

768
00:45:57,583 --> 00:46:00,486
and your family
and friends.

769
00:46:05,058 --> 00:46:08,327
Lexie,
please be my wife,

770
00:46:08,328 --> 00:46:10,762
my friend.

771
00:46:12,298 --> 00:46:14,866
Everything you see
from this mountain

772
00:46:14,867 --> 00:46:16,968
is mine...

773
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:19,871
and I give it all
to you.

774
00:46:19,872 --> 00:46:22,107
Be my only love,

775
00:46:22,108 --> 00:46:24,576
stay with me

776
00:46:24,577 --> 00:46:27,513
and I swear
I will be faithful

777
00:46:27,514 --> 00:46:30,215
and cherish you
until the last

778
00:46:30,216 --> 00:46:32,418
beat of my heart.

779
00:46:34,921 --> 00:46:38,090
Archie, I don't have
anything to give you

780
00:46:38,091 --> 00:46:40,825
except my heart,

781
00:46:40,826 --> 00:46:43,595
my soul and my life.

782
00:46:45,598 --> 00:46:48,033
You be my husband

783
00:46:48,034 --> 00:46:51,803
and I'll trust you
and I'll cherish you

784
00:46:51,804 --> 00:46:54,706
until the last breath

785
00:46:54,707 --> 00:46:56,108
leaves my body.

786
00:46:57,577 --> 00:46:59,911
<i>Alice: Do you take Lexie
as your wife, Archie?</i>

787
00:47:01,047 --> 00:47:02,914
I do.

788
00:47:02,915 --> 00:47:06,151
<i>Lexie, do you take
Archie as your husband?</i>

789
00:47:06,152 --> 00:47:07,886
I do.

790
00:47:09,222 --> 00:47:12,558
<i>Then, by the grace
of god,</i>

791
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:15,794
<i>you're husband
and wife.</i>

792
00:47:17,897 --> 00:47:19,965
<i>( clapping )</i>

793
00:47:26,139 --> 00:47:29,174
<i>( bagpipes playing )</i>

794
00:47:30,643 --> 00:47:33,078
( Lexie laughing )

795
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:38,250
( squealing )

796
00:47:38,251 --> 00:47:40,085
Come on, our turn.

797
00:47:40,086 --> 00:47:42,221
No, really, I need
my toes for counting.

798
00:47:42,222 --> 00:47:45,090
Oh, don't be silly. Look,
sword dancing for beginners!

799
00:47:47,793 --> 00:47:50,895
- Mother?
- I wish your father was here.

800
00:47:50,896 --> 00:47:53,465
Yeah, me too.

801
00:47:53,466 --> 00:47:56,401
He would have been so proud
to see you happy at last.

802
00:47:57,737 --> 00:47:59,738
You made the right choice, Archie.

803
00:47:59,739 --> 00:48:02,174
Be good to her,
and to yourself.

804
00:48:03,443 --> 00:48:05,277
( laughing )

805
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,216
So how did you
find me then?

806
00:48:11,217 --> 00:48:13,452
You can't even find
your shoes in the morning.

807
00:48:13,453 --> 00:48:15,687
I told you,
I followed my heart.

808
00:48:17,123 --> 00:48:19,791
Hey, Arch
- we'll be able to give these guys

809
00:48:19,792 --> 00:48:21,493
<i>a real testimonial
now, eh?</i>

810
00:48:21,494 --> 00:48:23,728
Is that
a tracking device?

811
00:48:25,097 --> 00:48:27,866
I thought you said
you followed your heart.

812
00:48:27,867 --> 00:48:29,535
Well, yeah, yeah...

813
00:48:29,536 --> 00:48:31,203
Duncan bugged your rucksack

814
00:48:31,204 --> 00:48:33,805
- and my heart told me to follow it.
- Oh, really?

815
00:48:35,575 --> 00:48:38,877
You know what we need now?
Fireworks!

816
00:48:38,878 --> 00:48:42,614
Brilliant idea. Duncan,
did you bring any fireworks?

817
00:48:44,016 --> 00:48:46,685
It's all right. Hector
sent some fireworks.

818
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:48,787
<i>Look.</i>

819
00:48:52,292 --> 00:48:54,560
My goodness.

820
00:48:54,561 --> 00:48:57,496
Look at that, Lex.

821
00:48:57,497 --> 00:48:59,731
You could make
a million wishes.

822
00:48:59,732 --> 00:49:02,033
You know what, Arch?

823
00:49:02,034 --> 00:49:04,769
I don't have
any more wishes left.
