1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,135
<i>Hector:
Half a century, Molly,</i>

2
00:00:05,136 --> 00:00:07,537
<i>since I swore allegiance
to king and country.</i>

3
00:00:07,538 --> 00:00:11,007
We went into the army
as boys, green, callow;

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,409
<i>came out men,
bold and bloody.</i>

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,946
Now the regiment
reunites just as we vowed,

6
00:00:15,947 --> 00:00:18,215
50 years to the day.
The old squad,

7
00:00:18,216 --> 00:00:21,251
together again for the
first time since the war.

8
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:23,153
- How many are coming?
- Six.

9
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:25,155
- Six?
- Molly: What happened to the rest?

10
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:27,557
Eight were untraceable.
One one is living with

11
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:30,127
a costume designer in Perth,
calls herself Judith.

12
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:33,296
<i>- Another is missing in Acton.
- Shouldn't that be action?</i>

13
00:00:33,297 --> 00:00:36,399
No, Acton-
suburb of London.

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,302
Five have moved overseas. Two
have joined religious orders.

15
00:00:39,303 --> 00:00:42,005
Six haven't responded and
11 are no longer with us.

16
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:44,440
What about Toad?
He hasn't croaked, has he?

17
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:46,309
Hope not.
Hasn't RSVP'd.

18
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,112
- Toad?
- Best man at our wedding. You'd like him, Archie.

19
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:51,982
- They're coming up the drive.
- This is it.

20
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:53,549
Places, everyone.

21
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:57,320
<i>( bagpipes playing )</i>

22
00:01:03,727 --> 00:01:07,164
Hector: I was captain to a
fine body of soldiers, Archie.

23
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:10,333
Lean, clean- and mean,
when we had to be.

24
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,144
( wracking coughs )

25
00:01:22,313 --> 00:01:24,614
<i>- Hector: there.
- ( coughs )</i>

26
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:27,717
Did you ever see
a more splendid sight?

27
00:01:27,718 --> 00:01:30,153
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

28
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:05,555
May I have a moment,
everyone?

29
00:02:06,657 --> 00:02:09,392
Um... this is
Mr. Chris McCullen,

30
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:11,627
the owner of what
is undoubtedly

31
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:14,664
the centerpiece
of this exhibition.

32
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:17,267
For 24 hours, anyway.

33
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:19,135
- Mr. McCullen.
- Thank you.

34
00:02:19,136 --> 00:02:21,104
( applause )

35
00:02:22,673 --> 00:02:25,942
"The Proud Piper"
is a tribute

36
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:29,412
to the courage of yourselves
and your fellow old Caledonians.

37
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:31,014
<i>- Hector: Hear, hear!
- Soldiers: hear, hear.</i>

38
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:33,750
And since the 1970
disbandment, I am honored

39
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:36,686
that it has been in the
possession of my family.

40
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:39,289
And you should
be equally honored

41
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,391
to have it here today.

42
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:43,226
Ladies and gentlemen-

43
00:02:43,227 --> 00:02:45,295
<i>the regimental mascot,</i>

44
00:02:45,296 --> 00:02:47,130
"the Proud Piper. "

45
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,502
- Hector: Splendid, bravo.
- ( clapping )

46
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:54,938
"The Proud Piper!"

47
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:57,874
All:
"The Proud Piper!"

48
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,776
( laughing )

49
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:03,679
Look at him-
happy as a sandboy.

50
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,216
And the painting really
is the icing on the cake.

51
00:03:06,217 --> 00:03:08,919
It's a shame we can't keep
it for longer than a day.

52
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,686
I mean you'd think
for ï¿½500...

53
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:14,490
we are lucky to have gotten Mr.
McCullen to hire it to us at all.

54
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:16,993
It's been in exhibitions
all over the world,

55
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:19,896
as he will tell you at
great length, if you let him.

56
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:22,933
- Look out.
- Can I offer you a refill?

57
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:26,502
I think I'll pass. Not
quite what I'm used to.

58
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:28,638
- George, this is my boy Archie.
- How do you do?

59
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,341
- It's a real pleasure.
- This is Stella.

60
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:33,709
- Hi.
- ( suggestively ) Hello.

61
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,012
How long have
you two been together?

62
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:37,780
No, we're not-

63
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:39,715
well, we are-
but not as a couple.

64
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:41,884
I'm the estate's
financial controller.

65
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:44,754
Oooh! handed over
the baton, eh, Hector?

66
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:46,389
Something like that.

67
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,558
George: All is going
swimmingly, I take it?

68
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:51,995
Stella: Started to. we even
made a small profit last month.

69
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:53,997
Not just a pretty face, eh?

70
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:55,465
<i>( George chuckles )</i>

71
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:57,867
I'm sure the future's
in safe hands.

72
00:03:57,868 --> 00:04:00,070
What do you say, Hector?

73
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:02,072
To Stella
and Archie!

74
00:04:02,073 --> 00:04:04,674
- What is it, darling?
- Any news on Toad?

75
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:07,477
No, I had hoped that
the hero of Halfway Hill

76
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:10,013
would be with us but
- I hope nothing's happened to him.

77
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:29,699
Excellent vintage, George.

78
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,069
Good, there's stacks more
in the Bentley.

79
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,705
Now then, what have
we got to go with it?

80
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:38,808
I hope you haven't put the cookhouse
to too much trouble, Hector.

81
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:41,811
Corned beef hash and cabbage.
What do you think about that?

82
00:04:41,812 --> 00:04:45,115
- What's this then?
- I don't believe it.

83
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:47,484
See? I told you
they wouldn't like it.

84
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:50,620
Just wait till tomorrow, a real treat for youse
- spam fritters.

85
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:52,989
( groaning )

86
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,692
It's a taste of the old days. I
thought that was what we were here for.

87
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:59,595
If only. But the
digestion's not what it was.

88
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:02,598
I've organized all the menus.
An army marches on its stomach.

89
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,867
And what did you
always used to say?

90
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:07,237
"A successful plan
is a flexible plan"?

91
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:09,272
It'll mean getting in
fresh supplies.

92
00:05:09,273 --> 00:05:10,973
I'll see what I can arrange.

93
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:13,476
Good man, Archie,
and don't spare the expense.

94
00:05:13,477 --> 00:05:15,678
<i>- We can all chip in.
- Guests: hear, hear.</i>

95
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:18,181
Aren't you going to eat
something before you go?

96
00:05:18,182 --> 00:05:20,016
Actually, I don't
think I will.

97
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:22,885
But then that's all the more
for you, isn't it?

98
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:36,966
You could see it today.

99
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:39,402
People take to Archie
very quickly.

100
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:41,471
That's a rare quality.

101
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:42,972
Is that right?

102
00:05:45,142 --> 00:05:49,212
- Well... in business I mean.
- Of course.

103
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:50,913
<i>- Lexie: hiya.
- Hi.</i>

104
00:05:50,914 --> 00:05:52,982
We were just
talking about you.

105
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:55,151
All good I hope.
I need the checkbook.

106
00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:58,421
- What for?
- Bit of a change on the catering front.

107
00:05:58,422 --> 00:06:00,656
Less corned beef
more cordon bleu.

108
00:06:00,657 --> 00:06:03,659
I'm popping into town to see
what I can pick up. Don't worry-

109
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,262
- we're not footing the whole bill.
- In that case,

110
00:06:06,263 --> 00:06:09,232
why don't I come with you?
Two heads are better than one.

111
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,667
- Yeah, okay.
- Why don't I come with you?

112
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:15,838
- It doesn't need all three of us.
- And I am paying for it.

113
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,941
- Who'll be doing the cooking?
- Why don't you two just go together?

114
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:21,177
There's plenty
I could be doing here.

115
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:29,619
( laughing )

116
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:33,656
Now then,
listen up, chaps.

117
00:06:33,657 --> 00:06:36,926
I know you don't all want
to be sitting around all day.

118
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:38,995
- ( laughter )
- Golly!

119
00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:42,465
- Tell them about the facilities.
- Do you have a sauna?

120
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:44,134
- Sorry?
- A sauna?

121
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:47,370
- Afraid not.
- I couldn't manage without mine.

122
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:51,441
- A jacuzzi?
- Golly: We're more a kind of outdoor activity style.

123
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:53,809
Shooting, fishing,
hill walking.

124
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,711
But I could take you
out in the loch,

125
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:58,381
- or give you a tour
of the estate. - Uh-huh.

126
00:06:58,382 --> 00:07:01,083
- There's no doubt in my mind.
- Yes, George?

127
00:07:01,084 --> 00:07:03,886
A brandy, a cigar and a
good long think about it.

128
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:05,721
- Come on, lads.
- ( mates agree )

129
00:07:07,691 --> 00:07:10,160
<i>- Hector: Golly.
- Yes, boss?</i>

130
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:12,262
Stand easy.

131
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:14,230
Thanks, boss.

132
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:21,337
How long do you think
you've got left, then?

133
00:07:21,338 --> 00:07:23,406
<i>Before you move on?</i>

134
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:25,875
Are you trying
to get rid of me?

135
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:27,677
No, no!

136
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:29,812
Just wondered.

137
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:31,347
Realistically,

138
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:33,550
I could be gone
in a couple of weeks.

139
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:36,553
Although I'd like to stay as
long as Archie feels he needs me.

140
00:07:39,657 --> 00:07:41,724
<i>Lexie: He'll be lucky
to get a lift out here.</i>

141
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:44,060
- Pull over.
- Are you joking? He could be anyone.

142
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:46,296
And he might be stranded
with a very long way

143
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:47,930
to the next bus.
Pull over.

144
00:07:53,837 --> 00:07:56,239
Now what are the chances
of that happening?

145
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,274
- What?
- Me being offered a lift

146
00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:00,610
by two of the prettiest
girls in the highlands.

147
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:03,446
Don't get too carried away. It
depends on where you're going.

148
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:05,981
But we can at least point
you in the right direction.

149
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:07,917
Proper couple
of angels you are.

150
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:10,152
Do you know
the Glenbogle estate?

151
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:12,388
It's your lucky day.

152
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,324
I hope so, lass.

153
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,528
( chuckles )

154
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:27,403
Is he all right,
George?

155
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:31,274
He's sure to be.

156
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:33,509
( snorts )

157
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,778
George:
There you are, you see.

158
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:38,548
Rather partial
to an afternoon nap, myself.

159
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,883
Least he's still with us.

160
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:42,719
Which reminds me,

161
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,421
let's raise our glasses
to those who aren't.

162
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:47,490
Our comrades who fell
alongside us,

163
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:49,592
and those chums
who came through it

164
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:51,193
but can't be
with us today.

165
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:53,396
- Absent friends.
- All: Absent friends!

166
00:08:53,397 --> 00:08:55,598
- Wherever they may be!
- All: Hear, hear.

167
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:57,833
<i>Stranger: I can tell
you where one of them is.</i>

168
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:59,702
Ah, it's Toad!

169
00:08:59,703 --> 00:09:03,205
<i>- George: Toad!
- Who else?</i>

170
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:05,841
Toady! I can't believe it. You got here.

171
00:09:05,842 --> 00:09:08,578
- Did you ever doubt it?
- Well done, old son.

172
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:12,848
Is that the lot?

173
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:14,884
Yep, I think so.

174
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:16,919
What about
that one?

175
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,622
<i>- Careful!
- ( glass shatters )</i>

176
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:21,491
( Lexie screams )

177
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:26,228
Oh my...

178
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:31,334
the hero of Halfway Hill!

179
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:33,770
- This must be your daughter?
- Oh, stop it.

180
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:35,772
Give me a hug.

181
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:37,740
I knew you wouldn't
miss an opportunity

182
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:39,676
to meet up
with your old friends.

183
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:42,178
Never mind about them,
it's you I've come to see.

184
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:44,814
- Lexie, have you met?
- Yeah, yeah, we have.

185
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:46,816
Have you got a minute?

186
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:53,122
Oh dear, someone ought
to fetch Archie.

187
00:09:53,123 --> 00:09:56,559
- Stella: Someone already has.
- How did this happen?

188
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,262
- It was an accident.
- We were trying to get cleared as quickly as possible.

189
00:10:00,263 --> 00:10:03,333
- I don't think Lexie realized-
- are you saying it's my fault?

190
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:05,468
It's what Mr. McCullen
says that matters.

191
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:07,437
This is ï¿½20,000
worth of paintings,

192
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:09,872
he was at great pains
to mention more than once.

193
00:10:09,873 --> 00:10:11,708
Can you do anything
with it, Molly?

194
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:13,343
I'll try.

195
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:15,911
Archie, you'd better take it
up to my studio.

196
00:10:15,912 --> 00:10:17,480
I'll need
some scissors, tape
197
00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:19,915
<i>- and some strong adhesive.
- Anything else?</i>

198
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,485
A miracle-
if you can arrange it.

199
00:10:24,988 --> 00:10:28,190
<i>Archie: Hopefully, we're insured.</i>

200
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:31,093
That was our silver wedding. I
wish you could have been there.

201
00:10:31,094 --> 00:10:32,995
Not half as much
as I do.

202
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:35,565
Molly is looking
as pretty as ever.

203
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:37,266
She seems happy too,

204
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:39,969
you must be doing something
right, you old dog.

205
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,004
One tries one's best.
What about you?

206
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:44,106
Did you ever take
the long walk?

207
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:47,377
- Up the aisle?
- Ah, yes. planning to.

208
00:10:48,812 --> 00:10:50,713
Catherine,
that's her name.

209
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:53,716
Delightful. You must bring
her up with you next time.

210
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:56,085
- No can do.
- You must. We'd be delighted.

211
00:10:56,086 --> 00:10:59,555
She's pretty much of a one-off, I'm
afraid. It was important that I saw you.

212
00:10:59,556 --> 00:11:02,692
The fact is I shouldn't
even be in the country.

213
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:05,094
- Hayfever?
- No, no, no.

214
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:07,663
I meant "country"
as in "this great nation. "

215
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:10,065
Officially, I'm on the lam.

216
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:13,503
Nothing to be ashamed of. I have no
truck with all this vegetarian nonsense.

217
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:15,872
No, no, no.
I did a runner.

218
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:17,740
- Runner?
- Went over the wall.

219
00:11:17,741 --> 00:11:20,276
- Whose wall?
- Her Majesty's.

220
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:22,278
I've escaped from prison.

221
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,714
Good lord.
( chuckles )

222
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:26,682
Molly:
How's that?

223
00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:28,885
- Lexie: Better.
- You can still see it.

224
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:31,821
Only if you look
very closely.

225
00:11:31,822 --> 00:11:33,723
But that's what you do
with paintings.

226
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:36,358
Archie does know
what he's talking about.

227
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:38,127
Molly:
One last try then.

228
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:46,469
Come on.

229
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,905
<i>( painting rips )</i>

230
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:50,640
Oh- oh dear.

231
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:54,243
I always had a knack
with the old explosives.

232
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:57,179
So when we all
went our separate ways,

233
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,249
I found a career that put
my talents to good use.

234
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,151
- Demolition?
- Safe-breaking.

235
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:05,521
- Precious stones mainly.
- Good lord!

236
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:07,757
But it's a young man's game.

237
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:10,426
Eventually I got caught.
But not before

238
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:12,795
I'd salted away enough
for my retirement.

239
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:15,030
So I dug in
and did my time.

240
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:16,933
Took it on the chin,
I'll wager.

241
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,901
Wouldn't have expected
anything less.

242
00:12:18,902 --> 00:12:20,970
It wasn't enough
for the old bill though.

243
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:23,038
Almost as soon
as I got out,

244
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,942
I got framed for a job
that wasn't mine.

245
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:27,910
Ended up
with another 10 years.

246
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:29,779
I made my break in '89,

247
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,714
still with eight
left to serve.

248
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:34,484
- Where have you been hiding?
- Marbella.

249
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:36,552
I've got a lot
of friends out there.

250
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:38,354
And now, of course
there's...

251
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:40,756
- Catherine?
- Yeah, that's the fella.

252
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:43,559
This is the first time
I've been back.

253
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,395
It wasn't easy, but I couldn't
let the old team down.

254
00:12:46,396 --> 00:12:49,131
- Especially you, captain.
- Heck of a chance to take.

255
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:51,367
You know I've
always remembered

256
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:53,168
our pact to meet up.

257
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:55,070
And you know
there are things

258
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:56,839
that need to be said.

259
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,774
Last goodbyes, you mean?

260
00:12:58,775 --> 00:13:01,544
- Partly.
- But what if you get caught?

261
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:04,013
Who's gonna know I'm here?

262
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:07,316
Welcome to Glenbogle, historical
home of the Clan MacDonald,

263
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:09,485
with amenities
now open to the public,

264
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:11,787
including our new
military exhibition,

265
00:13:11,788 --> 00:13:14,289
which will only be
with us for a short while.

266
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,425
So if you'd like
to go straight on up-

267
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:18,460
thanks, but we're not
here for sightseeing.

268
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:20,796
We heard a long-lost
friend was in the area.

269
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:23,032
Ah, it will be
the reunion then.

270
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:25,935
The old soldiers,
they're having a get-together.

271
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:28,037
Worth checking out.
Got to be.

272
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:29,839
If you're going
that way anyway,

273
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,974
I could do you
a deal on the tickets.

274
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:33,776
Let's say- half price?

275
00:13:33,777 --> 00:13:37,046
Thanks, but when
you've got one of these

276
00:13:37,047 --> 00:13:40,149
you don't pay
to get in anywhere.

277
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,919
This is Toad. A more courageous
man you'll never meet.

278
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,321
- Please.
- You wouldn't believe what he's gone through to get here.

279
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:50,225
We don't need to bore everyone with
the details. Suffice it to say I'm here.

280
00:13:50,226 --> 00:13:53,128
And never has Glenbogle
had a more welcome guest.

281
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:55,130
Pulled me out
of many a scrape.

282
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:57,633
- Haven't we all?
- Quite.

283
00:13:57,634 --> 00:14:00,269
Toad, whatever you want,
treat this place like home.

284
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,871
<i>( knocking )</i>

285
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:04,440
Sorry to interrupt
but Duncan's on his way

286
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:06,475
up the drive
with a couple of fellows

287
00:14:06,476 --> 00:14:09,211
that have the definite look
of the law about them.

288
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:11,614
Oh, mother, not more
parking fines.

289
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:17,519
It must be a really
extensive job, then.

290
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,188
It brings
its own rewards.

291
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:21,356
Like getting to drive
as fast as you can?

292
00:14:21,357 --> 00:14:24,526
I thought about joining the
force myself, when I was younger.

293
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:26,696
- So what stopped you?
- My mother.

294
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:30,733
She said there was already
enough disgrace in the family.

295
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:32,768
Ah, here's our man.

296
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:36,171
- Archie, this is-
- D.S. Grundy and D.C. West.

297
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:38,173
National Crime Squad.

298
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:41,143
- They're with the police.
- Yes, thank you, Duncan.

299
00:14:41,144 --> 00:14:44,013
If there's anything
else you need

300
00:14:44,014 --> 00:14:47,382
- just ask.
- We'll bear it in mind.

301
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:50,252
- So what can I do for you?
- This man, have you seen him?

302
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:55,925
<i>Real name Terry McLean, aka Toady
Mclntyre, aka Terry the Toff.</i>

303
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:58,393
Notorious jewel thief-
in his day.

304
00:14:58,394 --> 00:15:00,562
Ugly boot,
isn't he?

305
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:02,331
Sorry, can't help you, can we?

306
00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:03,966
No.

307
00:15:05,802 --> 00:15:07,903
This is my father.

308
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:10,205
Why don't you have
a proper look?

309
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:16,112
We are open to the public. We get a
lot of people wandering around here.

310
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:19,314
- But definitely not him. - He's
in the area and he's not camera-shy.

311
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:22,551
They caught him on video at Edinburgh
airport, and at Inverness station.

312
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:24,754
Archie: That doesn't
mean he's here, does it?

313
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:28,423
He's also ex-army. If you've got
some sort of reunion going on-

314
00:15:28,424 --> 00:15:30,425
it's just a coincidence,
isn't it?

315
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:32,561
- Yes.
- So you won't mind-

316
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:34,096
if we have a wander round?

317
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:36,198
Duncan: I could show
you around if you like.

318
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:37,933
Why don't you
do that?

319
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:47,242
Mmm.

320
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:50,813
Thanks for your support,
by the way.

321
00:15:50,814 --> 00:15:52,715
How do you mean?

322
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:55,718
Trying to stir things up with Archie
about what happened to the painting.

323
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:57,753
I was just telling it like it was.

324
00:15:57,754 --> 00:16:00,355
Oh, please, you must think
my mother knitted me.

325
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:02,291
<i>What are you
talking about?</i>

326
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:04,694
The way you keep
trying to put me down.

327
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:07,997
You should hear yourself. "Archie
knows what he's talking about. "

328
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:10,666
And "I'll be here for as long
as he feels he needs me. "

329
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,702
<i>That doesn't mean
anything.</i>

330
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:15,270
It means you fancy him
something rotten.

331
00:16:18,742 --> 00:16:20,409
See?

332
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,678
I'm right, aren't I?

333
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:25,114
What's the matter, Lex?

334
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:27,449
Afraid of a little
competition?

335
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,687
( scoffs )

336
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:33,956
Molly: I simply cannot
allow you in there.

337
00:16:33,957 --> 00:16:37,026
<i>- Why would that be?
- ( toilet flushes )</i>

338
00:16:40,396 --> 00:16:43,065
Oh sorry, didn't realize
there was a queue.

339
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,334
You could have just said.

340
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:54,543
All clear.

341
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:12,461
<i>Duncan: The dining room's this way.</i>

342
00:17:15,698 --> 00:17:17,867
What's down here then?

343
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:20,102
The kitchen.
Come on.

344
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,976
Duncan, Duncan.

345
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:32,815
<i>- Molly: you've been this way before.
- Officer: I don't think so.</i>

346
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:34,650
Ahhh ahh ah.

347
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:36,986
Ahh ah!

348
00:17:36,987 --> 00:17:40,956
- What is going on?
- Toad's in the hole!

349
00:17:40,957 --> 00:17:43,025
He's hardly going to be in there, is he?

350
00:17:43,026 --> 00:17:45,527
What do you think? We've
got him peeling potatoes?

351
00:17:45,528 --> 00:17:47,763
Let's just see.
Shall we?

352
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:52,334
Right.

353
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:58,941
You see you have to get
as much air in as possible.

354
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:01,210
That's the secret
of very good meringue.

355
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:03,846
<i>Hector: What my baked
Alaska sadly lacks.</i>

356
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:07,516
Oh, ah,

357
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:09,685
hello, chaps.
Any luck?

358
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:14,089
- Doesn't seem like it.
- Did try to tell you.

359
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,558
Are sure you don't want
to search the whole estate?

360
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,995
<i>35 and 1/2 thousand acres. Start
now, you might finish by Tuesday-</i>

361
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:23,032
that won't be necessary. Which is
the quickest way back to the car?

362
00:18:23,033 --> 00:18:24,733
Through here.

363
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:33,309
Sorry to have
troubled you folks.

364
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:44,486
Okay?
You can come out now.

365
00:18:46,356 --> 00:18:47,723
<i>( Hector laughs )</i>

366
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:51,493
Well done, Lexie. Terry,
a small dram to celebrate?

367
00:18:51,494 --> 00:18:53,795
<i>- Oh, aye.
- Archie: father?</i>

368
00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:56,598
I think we need a word.

369
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,634
Molly: Toad, you're an
outlaw. How exciting.

370
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:03,005
Did you ever meet Mr. Big-
in the slammer, I mean?

371
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:05,707
This isn't a movie, mother.

372
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,509
I'm sorry, Toad,
we'd like to help but-

373
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,811
and we will. You'll
stay as long as you like.

374
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:12,481
Stella: MacDonald family
harbors escaped prisoner.

375
00:19:12,482 --> 00:19:15,851
- How's that going to look?
- What if he was wrongly convicted?

376
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:19,855
- We've only got his word for it.
- Toad wouldn't lie, not to me.

377
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:22,657
Archie: The jury obviously
seemed to think differently.

378
00:19:22,658 --> 00:19:26,095
I'm sorry. If he gets caught here,
we could all end up behind bars.

379
00:19:26,096 --> 00:19:28,697
<i>- It wouldn't come to that.
- Stella: he's right.</i>

380
00:19:28,698 --> 00:19:31,400
Do you know what the penalty is
for hiding a fugitive, Hector?

381
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:35,771
<i>- Just because you two played soldiers
does not mean- - Hector: young lady!</i>

382
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:38,073
Ours was a friendship
forged on a battlefield.

383
00:19:38,074 --> 00:19:41,443
Giving him up would be like betraying
a brother. Can't you understand?

384
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:44,380
- It's all right, captain.
- No, it's not!

385
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:47,516
- This all happened a very long time ago.
- Yes, it did.

386
00:19:47,517 --> 00:19:50,819
But when somebody saves your
life, you tend not to forget.

387
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,855
<i>- Is that true?
- Hector: it was in korea.</i>

388
00:19:53,856 --> 00:19:56,091
<i>Our first taste
of real action.</i>

389
00:19:56,092 --> 00:19:57,759
We were all
terrified.

390
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,995
A machine gun post
had pinned us down.

391
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:02,364
Could have wiped out
the whole regiment.

392
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:05,834
But Toad volunteered to go with
me and destroy the bally thing.

393
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:08,870
All I managed to do was get
myself knocked unconscious.

394
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:10,839
Toad went on- alone.

395
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,242
And blew the thing
to smithereens,

396
00:20:13,243 --> 00:20:15,477
then he carried me back.

397
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:17,046
If he hadn't,

398
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:19,548
none of us would be
standing here today.

399
00:20:23,987 --> 00:20:26,155
He got the military cross
for his bravery.

400
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:28,090
It's a debt
of honor, Archie.

401
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:30,359
Why didn't you tell us
any of this before?

402
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,762
I didn't want to talk about it.
I was one of the lucky ones.

403
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:37,499
Lots of our chums
never came back.

404
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,801
I can get him out
first thing in the morning.

405
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:42,171
One night,
that's all I'm asking.

406
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:47,943
<i>- All right, one night.
- Toad: oh, thank you.</i>

407
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:51,013
- Thank you both. - We'll
organize four-hour watches.

408
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:53,715
Nobody gets into Glenbogle
without my knowing it.

409
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,525
- West: Could be a long night.
- Grundy: Not for me.

410
00:21:03,526 --> 00:21:06,561
Camped about all over the
place when I was in the scouts.

411
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:09,198
I wouldn't be too quick to
admit that back at the station.

412
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,899
Nothing to be ashamed of.

413
00:21:13,036 --> 00:21:15,371
That old boy is definitely
hiding something.

414
00:21:18,508 --> 00:21:20,342
Hello.

415
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:27,682
Now you tell me...
there's nothing going on.

416
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:41,230
Thanks, by the way.

417
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:44,666
- What for? - For not kicking up
more of a fuss about Toad.

418
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:47,536
I know you don't think
the situation's ideal.

419
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:50,406
Let's keep it between
ourselves then.

420
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:52,508
Don't want people to think
I'm going soft.

421
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:55,344
Hmm, you're secret's
safe with me.

422
00:21:55,345 --> 00:21:59,081
In the meantime we have
McCullen coming in the morning.

423
00:21:59,082 --> 00:22:01,850
We start off
by apologizing, obviously.

424
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:04,253
<i>Eat a portion or two
of humble pie and then</i>

425
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:07,356
hand it straight
to the insurers.

426
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:10,359
Except we're not covered.

427
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,962
- What?
- There's an exemption clause.

428
00:22:13,963 --> 00:22:16,698
For "all antiquities and
works of art which are not

429
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:19,634
the absolute and sole property
of the policy holder. "

430
00:22:21,604 --> 00:22:23,004
You're joking?

431
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:31,713
Mission accomplished,
bacon or sausage?

432
00:22:31,714 --> 00:22:33,715
Surprise me.

433
00:22:35,818 --> 00:22:38,153
I checked all the hotels
within 20 miles.

434
00:22:38,154 --> 00:22:39,955
Not a sniff.

435
00:22:39,956 --> 00:22:42,224
Then it's even more
likely that he's here.

436
00:22:42,225 --> 00:22:44,460
We'll get
the main road covered.

437
00:22:44,461 --> 00:22:46,562
No one need know
we're even about.

438
00:22:48,264 --> 00:22:50,299
Still here, then?

439
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,935
- Looks like it.
- You haven't caught who you were after.

440
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:57,306
We think we missed him
in the search.

441
00:22:57,307 --> 00:23:01,176
You know... what we need
is a man on the inside-

442
00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:03,945
with a ready eye
and a keen brain.

443
00:23:03,946 --> 00:23:07,216
Ideally somebody who once wanted
to be a policeman themselves.

444
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:10,986
What would I have to do?

445
00:23:10,987 --> 00:23:13,388
We need to know how many men
are here for that reunion.

446
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:15,757
- And who they are.
- Spy on Hector's friends?

447
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:18,627
I couldn't do that.
He's done a lot for me.

448
00:23:18,628 --> 00:23:21,130
- Now's your chance to pay him back.
- How's that?

449
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:23,965
There's a strong possibility there's
a dangerous felon in their midst.

450
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:27,369
<i>A man with no conscience,
capable of doing real harm.</i>

451
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,639
You could help catch him
- it would mean going deep undercover.

452
00:23:36,146 --> 00:23:39,714
- Police issue.
- He'll have the cuffs on by lunch time.

453
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:43,485
I'm sorry, Arch.

454
00:23:44,887 --> 00:23:47,156
You're not gonna hold it
against me, are you?

455
00:23:47,157 --> 00:23:48,823
No, no, of course not.

456
00:23:52,662 --> 00:23:54,630
Any thoughts?

457
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:57,065
As far as I can see,
I still think our best bet

458
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:59,601
is to get it repaired-
professionally, I mean.

459
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:02,204
There is another way.

460
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:04,439
Possibly.

461
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,975
You could accept
personal liability.

462
00:24:06,976 --> 00:24:09,611
Why don't I like
the sound of that?

463
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:12,013
Then if McCullen does
want to make a claim,

464
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:14,383
it would be against you
and not the estate.

465
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:16,885
So I would end up paying? No thanks.

466
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:18,920
But you wouldn't.

467
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:22,023
Not unless you got a spare
20 grand kicking around.

468
00:24:22,024 --> 00:24:24,159
What do you reckon,
Archie?

469
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,162
Uh
- excuse me! Don't I get a say in this?

470
00:24:27,163 --> 00:24:29,331
What if I don't want
to take the blame?

471
00:24:29,332 --> 00:24:32,467
I could never ask you to do that.
we'll just have to come clean.

472
00:24:32,468 --> 00:24:34,869
It might not be as big
a disaster as we think.

473
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,839
Wasn't that what they kept
saying about the Millennium Dome?

474
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:42,678
- Toad: All the best.
- Mate #1: Good luck.

475
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:45,414
Good luck,
old son.

476
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:48,283
Right let's get this show
on the road, shall we?

477
00:24:48,284 --> 00:24:50,719
Just missing one piece
of vital equipment.

478
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,688
George.

479
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,025
<i>- Toad!
- au revoir, dear lady.</i>

480
00:24:57,026 --> 00:24:59,861
No, this time
I think it's goodbye.

481
00:24:59,862 --> 00:25:02,364
I do hope everything
works out.

482
00:25:02,365 --> 00:25:05,767
- Look after the old boy, won't you?
- Somebody's got to.

483
00:25:13,075 --> 00:25:15,344
What do you think?
Stroke of genius?

484
00:25:15,345 --> 00:25:17,679
That's what I like
about you, captain.

485
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,949
You always did know
how to travel in style.

486
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,118
( all chuckle )

487
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:30,925
Got yourself
a new hobby then?

488
00:25:30,926 --> 00:25:33,194
I just wanted a memento...

489
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:34,863
of the occasion.

490
00:25:34,864 --> 00:25:36,565
( growls )

491
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:47,842
"Press button 'a'

492
00:25:47,843 --> 00:25:49,745
to open the film chamber. "

493
00:25:49,746 --> 00:25:52,581
Done that.
"Insert film cassette. "

494
00:25:54,884 --> 00:25:56,285
<i>Duncan:
"Carry end... "</i>

495
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,088
left, left.

496
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:02,824
"Attach film end...

497
00:26:02,825 --> 00:26:04,693

498
00:26:04,694 --> 00:26:07,362
<i>( Duncan sighs )</i>

499
00:26:07,363 --> 00:26:09,665
Right.

500
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:12,334
"And close chamber. "

501
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:14,235
<i>( camera whirrs )</i>

502
00:26:15,505 --> 00:26:16,938
So far so good.

503
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,142
"Turn 'c' to advance film. "

504
00:26:21,143 --> 00:26:23,445
<i>Easy-peasy. right...</i>

505
00:26:23,446 --> 00:26:25,046
ready for you.

506
00:26:30,986 --> 00:26:32,487
( sighs )

507
00:26:35,658 --> 00:26:37,693
Mr. McCullen, just
the man I wanted to see.

508
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:39,894
Before you say anything,
I'd like to know why

509
00:26:39,895 --> 00:26:42,331
- I've been treated like a common criminal.
- Sorry?

510
00:26:42,332 --> 00:26:45,634
The policemen down by your bridge,
they've had my car turned inside out.

511
00:26:45,635 --> 00:26:48,437
I told them who I was
but would they listen?

512
00:26:48,438 --> 00:26:50,539
- Where's father?
- Just left.

513
00:26:52,408 --> 00:26:54,209
Coffee?

514
00:26:56,512 --> 00:26:59,914
Then-if you all give me
your names and addresses,

515
00:26:59,915 --> 00:27:02,417
then I can send you
copies later.

516
00:27:08,391 --> 00:27:10,592
Oh, perhaps or even one
with the laird himself.

517
00:27:10,593 --> 00:27:13,061
- I'm sure he wouldn't mind,
- ( engine roars )

518
00:27:15,231 --> 00:27:17,165
Not right now though,
obviously.

519
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:18,967
( camera clicks )

520
00:27:26,342 --> 00:27:28,977
A five-hour drive
to stranraer.

521
00:27:28,978 --> 00:27:31,212
Then I'll get you
straight on the ferry,

522
00:27:31,213 --> 00:27:33,248
and you can train it
from Dublin to Belfast.

523
00:27:33,249 --> 00:27:36,451
- It should be plain sailing.
- That's what I like about you,

524
00:27:36,452 --> 00:27:39,320
you always were the
master of faultless plan.

525
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:40,722
( both laughing )

526
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:42,691
Once you've got it, Toady,
you never lose it.

527
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:45,326
<i>- ( honking )
- It's Archie.</i>

528
00:27:46,396 --> 00:27:48,864
What's he playing at?

529
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,502
Father, pull off the road.

530
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,075
Hector:
Splendid, well done, Archie.

531
00:28:01,076 --> 00:28:04,045
Fantastic diversionary tactic, ha ha!

532
00:28:18,394 --> 00:28:20,729
( tires squealing )

533
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:23,765
- Hold it!
- Both of you!

534
00:28:25,234 --> 00:28:27,268
- What do you want?
- Grundy: Shut it.

535
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:31,105
I wonder what we
might have in here.

536
00:28:31,106 --> 00:28:34,042
- A gentleman's laundry is his own business.
- Humor us.

537
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:36,578
Sheets, shirts, socks
and assorted unmentionables.

538
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:38,780
You expect us to believe
you do your own washing?

539
00:28:38,781 --> 00:28:42,383
- My father's a very modern man.
- That's right. I'm a wizard with a mangle.

540
00:28:42,384 --> 00:28:44,653
We haven't got time for
this. Come on, out you get!

541
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,797
Archie: Anything else
we can help you with?

542
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:57,165
You-

543
00:28:58,233 --> 00:29:00,201
looks like an open
and shut case.

544
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:09,644
I still think we should
wait for Archie.

545
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:12,647
I have no time. I have to get
"the Piper" properly packaged.

546
00:29:12,648 --> 00:29:15,350
I've got a gala unveiling
in Canada, next week.

547
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:16,685
So-

548
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:20,856
<i>shall we?</i>

549
00:29:20,857 --> 00:29:23,424
The thing is,
you see-

550
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:26,361
you can't...
anticipate

551
00:29:26,362 --> 00:29:28,763
every... eventuality, can you?

552
00:29:28,764 --> 00:29:31,466
What exactly is it
you're talking about?

553
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:33,935
<i>Stella:
Lexie!</i>

554
00:29:33,936 --> 00:29:37,338
I don't think it needs
the both of us to tell him.

555
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:38,840
Do you?

556
00:29:41,844 --> 00:29:45,179
He's a wily old fox,
you've got to agree.

557
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,116
Toady! plan b, eh?

558
00:29:48,117 --> 00:29:49,851
Hold on a minute.

559
00:29:49,852 --> 00:29:52,888
I'm sorry, Toad, but I think
we've done all we can for you.

560
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:56,525
If Toad gets caught he'll spend
the rest of his life in prison.

561
00:29:56,526 --> 00:29:59,628
- It's a risk, but- - it's a
risk I'm not prepared to take.

562
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:02,731
- There's police all over the place.
- If you make Toad leave,

563
00:30:02,732 --> 00:30:05,133
<i>I'll walk down there and
give myself up with him.</i>

564
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:08,737
- Please, you don't mean that.
- Don't I? Toady, let's face this together.

565
00:30:08,738 --> 00:30:10,839
No, no, wait,
Archie's right.

566
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,975
I put your whole family
in jeopardy.

567
00:30:13,976 --> 00:30:17,512
That was wrong of me.
I should never have come back.

568
00:30:17,513 --> 00:30:20,715
Nonsense, have you forgotten
how much I owe you?

569
00:30:20,716 --> 00:30:23,552
That's just it.
You don't owe me anything.

570
00:30:23,553 --> 00:30:26,655
You're too modest for your
own good. That's your trouble.

571
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:28,256
<i>I'm no hero, Hector.</i>

572
00:30:28,257 --> 00:30:31,292
That's what I came here
to tell you.

573
00:30:31,293 --> 00:30:33,728
Call me old-fashioned,
but as far as I am aware,

574
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:36,431
they don't just hand out
military crosses willy-nilly.

575
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:38,366
Will you let me finish?

576
00:30:39,535 --> 00:30:41,469
<i>It was a mistake.</i>

577
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,940
It should have been pinned
on your chest, not mine.

578
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:48,509
He's only saying this to make you
feel better. I hope you realize that.

579
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,946
I'm not the brave one-
if I was...

580
00:30:50,947 --> 00:30:53,014
I would have come clean
before now.

581
00:30:53,015 --> 00:30:55,416
Heaven knows I've wanted to
often enough.

582
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:57,318
What are you
talking about?

583
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:00,521
It was you that destroyed
that machine gun.

584
00:31:00,522 --> 00:31:02,591
I don't understand.

585
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,360
I was just decoy.

586
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:08,863
You were the one
who got behind it

587
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:10,865
with the grenade.

588
00:31:10,866 --> 00:31:13,635
I've never seen
such mettle.

589
00:31:13,636 --> 00:31:15,804
I remember thinking,

590
00:31:15,805 --> 00:31:18,306
"he can't get any nearer. "

591
00:31:18,307 --> 00:31:20,208
But you did!

592
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:23,778
In the end, you got so close
that the blast knocked you out.

593
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:25,647
I had to carry you back.

594
00:31:25,648 --> 00:31:27,749
I was so worried
you were dead.

595
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,851
And I never got
the chance to tell you

596
00:31:29,852 --> 00:31:31,953
what had actually happened.

597
00:31:31,954 --> 00:31:34,322
<i>When you came around,
of course,</i>

598
00:31:34,323 --> 00:31:36,725
<i>you couldn't
remember a thing.</i>

599
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:38,660
<i>And so, somehow or other...</i>

600
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:43,197
I ended up
by taking the credit.

601
00:31:43,198 --> 00:31:45,266
And the longer it went on

602
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:47,401
the harder
it was to own up

603
00:31:47,402 --> 00:31:49,403
to the truth.

604
00:31:49,404 --> 00:31:51,405
Because you see,

605
00:31:51,406 --> 00:31:54,275
I rather enjoyed being...

606
00:31:54,276 --> 00:31:56,544
"the hero
of Halfway Hill. "

607
00:32:00,616 --> 00:32:03,417
I've no right
to ask anything of you.

608
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:07,188
Will you turn
yourself in?

609
00:32:07,189 --> 00:32:09,590
Not if I can help it.

610
00:32:09,591 --> 00:32:11,893
But, if things get rough,

611
00:32:11,894 --> 00:32:13,762
I'll just say I hid up here

612
00:32:13,763 --> 00:32:15,630
without your knowledge.

613
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,241
You've got my word.

614
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,088
Father-

615
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:45,393
father.

616
00:32:46,762 --> 00:32:48,697
<i>McCullen screaming:
For goodness sake,</i>

617
00:32:48,698 --> 00:32:50,832
<i>what have you done
to this painting?</i>

618
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:53,735
<i>- Grundy: well?
- West: just tourists.</i>

619
00:32:57,173 --> 00:32:58,940
So what now, gov?

620
00:32:58,941 --> 00:33:00,909
Storm the castle?

621
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,510
No, no.

622
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:04,245
<i>We just sit tight.</i>

623
00:33:04,246 --> 00:33:06,614
<i>Their luck's got
to run out sometime.</i>

624
00:33:06,615 --> 00:33:08,416
- I've done it!
- What?

625
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:11,385
Ugh!
What you asked me to.

626
00:33:11,386 --> 00:33:14,589
There's six of them.
And I've got photographs.

627
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,524
I knew you were
the man for the job.

628
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:18,159
Can we see them,
the pictures?

629
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,196
Dropped them at the chemists',
get them back wednesday.

630
00:33:27,803 --> 00:33:30,772
- I can't apologize enough.
- Can't do anything, if you ask me.

631
00:33:30,773 --> 00:33:34,442
This painting was irreplaceable.
You knew that.

632
00:33:34,443 --> 00:33:36,510
Did you...

633
00:33:36,511 --> 00:33:40,314
- have it insured?
- It's monetary value is of no consequence.

634
00:33:40,315 --> 00:33:43,651
<i>- So it was covered?
- It's the historical significance.</i>

635
00:33:43,652 --> 00:33:45,519
Yes, of course, yes.

636
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,422
It's just that you-
you did mention ï¿½20,000.

637
00:33:48,423 --> 00:33:52,127
That's without loss of earnings.
It commands substantial higher fees.

638
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,896
Mr. McCullen, we accept
full responsibility.

639
00:33:54,897 --> 00:33:57,665
I don't think you have
a lot of choice in that regard.

640
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:59,467
You ought to put
in a claim quickly.

641
00:33:59,468 --> 00:34:02,904
"The piper" was in your possession,
therefore, it is your responsibility.

642
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:09,210
<i>The thing is,
we don't think we're covered.</i>

643
00:34:09,211 --> 00:34:11,880
Just how incompetent
are you people?

644
00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:14,448
I think it's time
I called my solicitor.

645
00:34:34,303 --> 00:34:37,005
- Lexie: I thought you'd gone.
- Slight change of plan.

646
00:34:37,006 --> 00:34:38,940
They're on a bus trip
from Edinburgh,

647
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:42,277
<i>off in five minutes and I thought
I'd take my chances with them.</i>

648
00:34:42,278 --> 00:34:45,079
- Do you think you'll make it?
- It's my only hope.

649
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,883
And the way I see it, they're hard
pushed to search every vehicle.

650
00:34:48,884 --> 00:34:52,120
So I'll keep my head down
and keep my cool, eh?

651
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:54,455
All the best then.

652
00:34:54,456 --> 00:34:56,590
Thanks
for everything.

653
00:34:56,591 --> 00:34:59,961
What are you putting
on that easel?

654
00:34:59,962 --> 00:35:02,096
It was supposed
to be for a painting.

655
00:35:02,097 --> 00:35:04,199
"The Proud Piper. "
You heard of it?

656
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,735
Of course I have, regimental mascot
- symbol of good fortune.

657
00:35:07,736 --> 00:35:10,604
- Not for me, it wasn't.
- I only wish I'd seen it.

658
00:35:10,605 --> 00:35:14,108
- Bring yourself some luck?
- I'd like to take a closer look at it.

659
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:17,778
It's said to be
a very impressive copy.

660
00:35:21,283 --> 00:35:23,084
( whispers )
Copy.

661
00:35:24,153 --> 00:35:25,786
I'll be frank
with you.

662
00:35:25,787 --> 00:35:28,189
The estate can't come up
with that kind of cash.

663
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,959
- It could ruin us.
- Please, you'll have me in tears.

664
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,694
The bottom line is we all
have a living to make.

665
00:35:33,695 --> 00:35:35,796
Perhaps we could come
to an arrangement?

666
00:35:35,797 --> 00:35:37,832
I'm not interested.

667
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:39,467
"The Proud Piper"
was the last-

668
00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:42,570
was destroyed-
in 1935.

669
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:45,206
What's this then?
A figment of my imagination?

670
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:48,576
A reproduction, which you
no doubt well know,

671
00:35:48,577 --> 00:35:51,212
because your grandfather
was one of those men

672
00:35:51,213 --> 00:35:53,748
who conspired
to have that copy made.

673
00:35:53,749 --> 00:35:57,318
- I resent that.
- And I resent someone who's never even

674
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:00,955
worn a uniform, profiteering
from the regiment like that.

675
00:36:00,956 --> 00:36:03,992
Not only are you insulting
the memory of the old cals,

676
00:36:03,993 --> 00:36:05,994
you're ripping off
my friends.

677
00:36:05,995 --> 00:36:09,130
- I think I know more about art than you do.
- Maybe.

678
00:36:09,131 --> 00:36:12,233
But I've studied every detail
of the history of my regiment.

679
00:36:12,234 --> 00:36:14,202
And you're peddling
a fake.

680
00:36:14,203 --> 00:36:16,470
- Prove it.
- Lexie.

681
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,444
His cuff.

682
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:27,648
You have
to look closely.

683
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:31,119
Well, that's what you do
with paintings.

684
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,854
<i>Toad: The artist has
left us a wee clue-</i>

685
00:36:33,855 --> 00:36:36,124
<i>three red buttons-</i>

686
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:38,726
<i>which were not introduced
to the uniform</i>

687
00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:42,330
<i>until 150 years
after the original</i>

688
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:44,432
"Proud Piper" was painted.

689
00:36:46,168 --> 00:36:49,770
ï¿½20,000 you say it's worth?
Yeah, I reckon ï¿½2-

690
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:51,806
<i>at the absolute most.</i>

691
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:59,347
- You haven't heard he last of this.
- I think we probably have.

692
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,818
<i>( honking, engine starts )</i>

693
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:06,287
The coach.
You've missed it.

694
00:37:06,288 --> 00:37:08,923
Yes, I know.
Anyway, it was long shot.

695
00:37:08,924 --> 00:37:12,060
Archie: What are you gonna
do? The roads'll be blocked.

696
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:14,862
<i>- Surrender then.
- Lexie: you can't go to jail again.</i>

697
00:37:14,863 --> 00:37:17,999
- Not for something you didn't do.
- You could always appeal.

698
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,401
<i>- Takes years.
- Lexie: what about Catherine?</i>

699
00:37:20,402 --> 00:37:22,636
And your retirement?

700
00:37:22,637 --> 00:37:25,406
A nice dream but obviously
not meant to be.

701
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:29,944
We'll just have to dream up a
fiendishly inventive escape plan,

702
00:37:29,945 --> 00:37:33,047
- which is where my father comes in.
- Hector?

703
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:39,153
Father,
I've changed my mind.

704
00:37:39,154 --> 00:37:40,654
I think with our help,

705
00:37:40,655 --> 00:37:42,957
<i>Toad can still make it
back to Marbella.</i>

706
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:45,059
<i>I won't pretend
it's gonna be easy</i>

707
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,996
but I think it's worth a shot
if we all pull together.

708
00:37:52,468 --> 00:37:54,402
I understand.

709
00:37:54,403 --> 00:37:56,837
He doesn't want to know.

710
00:37:56,838 --> 00:37:58,839
And I don't blame him.

711
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,709
<i>Hector:
Did I say dismissed?</i>

712
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:05,079
I don't like deceit.
I don't like deception.

713
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,015
<i>Never have, never will.</i>

714
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:09,717
<i>But I'll never turn my back
on an old comrade.</i>

715
00:38:09,718 --> 00:38:12,487
Especially one who is...
as dear to me as you.

716
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:15,756
Thank you, captain.

717
00:38:15,757 --> 00:38:18,659
Don't just stand there,
round up the troops.

718
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,594
There are plans
to be laid.

719
00:38:22,631 --> 00:38:26,000
- Well done, Archie.
- I think it's the least we owe him.

720
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:29,603
Getting him out is going to be difficult.
the net is tightening as we speak.

721
00:38:29,604 --> 00:38:33,074
I know, but it's not beyond
the wit of a war hero

722
00:38:33,075 --> 00:38:34,708
to think of something.

723
00:38:41,016 --> 00:38:43,251
They were down there
yesterday.

724
00:38:46,788 --> 00:38:48,822
They're not
there now.

725
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,294
<i>Golly:
Wait a minute.</i>

726
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:55,229
Out of my way,
out!

727
00:38:57,632 --> 00:38:59,167
There they are.

728
00:39:01,203 --> 00:39:03,137
<i>Duncan: I still don't understand.</i>

729
00:39:03,138 --> 00:39:05,073
<i>They are the police,
aren't they?</i>

730
00:39:05,074 --> 00:39:07,241
That's what they are,
Duncan.

731
00:39:07,242 --> 00:39:10,244
- And I was doing right to offer to
help them? - Definitely.

732
00:39:10,245 --> 00:39:11,845
But I'm not to
anymore?

733
00:39:11,846 --> 00:39:14,515
Now you're
catching on, son.

734
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:16,117
Right.

735
00:39:18,053 --> 00:39:20,388
<i>Couldn't we get into
trouble for this though?</i>

736
00:39:20,389 --> 00:39:23,357
That is beginning to look
like a distinct possibility.

737
00:39:25,194 --> 00:39:26,927
What's all this about,
Mr. McCullen?

738
00:39:26,928 --> 00:39:30,030
It's this escaped prisoner
fellow. He's in the house.

739
00:39:30,031 --> 00:39:32,900
- Are you sure?
- I was speaking to him yesterday.

740
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:34,868
Get on the radio.

741
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:36,870
We want as many men here
as we can.

742
00:39:36,871 --> 00:39:39,740
He's not slipping
through my fingers now.

743
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:42,143
Duncan and Golly are here
at the bridge.

744
00:39:42,144 --> 00:39:44,812
Lexie, you'll be with Stella
on the old road.

745
00:39:44,813 --> 00:39:46,814
Aren't I
the lucky one?

746
00:39:46,815 --> 00:39:50,218
The success of this whole mission
relies on split-second timing.

747
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:53,654
- Does everybody know what they've got to do?
- Molly: Absolutely.

748
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:56,757
- I wait at the north gate.
- And we're all up for it?

749
00:39:56,758 --> 00:40:00,361
- Wouldn't miss an adventure like this
for the world. - Well said, George.

750
00:40:00,362 --> 00:40:04,265
- Archie, transpo laid on? - I've had to
call in a few favors but it's all arranged.

751
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:06,867
Good boy! Golly, what's
the news on the front line?

752
00:40:06,868 --> 00:40:09,837
Better get a move on, they're
calling for reinforcements.

753
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:11,572
Right. this is it.
Good luck, chaps.

754
00:40:11,573 --> 00:40:13,741
<i>Let's all try and come back
in one piece.</i>

755
00:40:13,742 --> 00:40:16,410
- Toad: I shan't forget this, Archie.
- Nor will I.

756
00:40:16,411 --> 00:40:18,012
And if it all goes well,

757
00:40:18,013 --> 00:40:20,348
I'll send you a piece
of wedding cake.

758
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:22,216
If you do decide
to get hitched up

759
00:40:22,217 --> 00:40:24,818
<i>you better come and have
your honeymoon with us.</i>

760
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:27,421
Archie: Nice idea, Toad,
but don't hold your breath.

761
00:40:27,422 --> 00:40:29,690
<i>I don't think you'll
have to look too far</i>

762
00:40:29,691 --> 00:40:31,859
for the right woman.

763
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,628
That's the least
of my worries.

764
00:40:33,629 --> 00:40:36,497
Golly, are you sure that
Duncan knows what's at stake?

765
00:40:36,498 --> 00:40:38,366
I made it as clear
as I can.

766
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:40,834
I told you we should
have sent someone else.

767
00:40:45,974 --> 00:40:49,743
- What's going on here then?
- You were supposed to be telling us that.

768
00:40:49,744 --> 00:40:53,614
Not that it matters anymore. We found
out all we need, thanks to Mr. McCullen.

769
00:40:53,615 --> 00:40:55,049
Yeah, sonny,
if you'd-

770
00:40:56,751 --> 00:40:59,287
<i>Duncan: You won't be
wanting my information, then?</i>

771
00:41:01,723 --> 00:41:04,492
One of the old soldier fellows
from the castle.

772
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:06,227
He asked me-

773
00:41:06,228 --> 00:41:08,362
"is there a way
of leaving the estate

774
00:41:08,363 --> 00:41:10,331
without being seen?"

775
00:41:10,332 --> 00:41:11,932
What did you tell him?

776
00:41:11,933 --> 00:41:15,203
I said, "that'd be tricky-
with what you're wearing. "

777
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:17,971
- And what was that?
- A bright yellow jacket.

778
00:41:17,972 --> 00:41:20,874
<i>But he didn't say when
he'd be making his break?</i>

779
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,911
Oh, soon. definitely.

780
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:27,615
( whispering )

781
00:41:38,993 --> 00:41:40,861
<i>Archie:
There's the signal.</i>

782
00:41:40,862 --> 00:41:44,064
- Hector: Ready, George?
- Just you try and stop me.

783
00:41:44,065 --> 00:41:45,633
Go, number one!

784
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,007
- Everyone's in position.
- Let's start moving in.

785
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,977
Wait, cancel that.

786
00:41:56,978 --> 00:41:59,012
<i>- there he is.
- the hare is on the move.</i>

787
00:41:59,013 --> 00:42:02,082
Repeat, the hare is on the move
and coming your way, delta team.

788
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:03,984
Go, number two.

789
00:42:05,053 --> 00:42:07,455
Hang on a minute.
There's another.

790
00:42:07,456 --> 00:42:09,523
<i>- And another.
- West: what do you want to do?</i>

791
00:42:11,326 --> 00:42:14,228
Get them all grabbed. One of
them has got to be our man.

792
00:42:14,229 --> 00:42:16,297
West to alpha and delta,

793
00:42:16,298 --> 00:42:19,066
west to alpha and delta,
all are to be detained.

794
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:21,636
<i>Repeat, all are
to be detained.</i>

795
00:42:21,637 --> 00:42:26,407
Excuse me.

796
00:42:26,408 --> 00:42:28,309
I hate to worry you.

797
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:32,480
There's a suspicious man
in the field over there.

798
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:35,549
You can't miss him. He's
wearing a yellow anorak thingy.

799
00:42:42,357 --> 00:42:45,493
<i>I can manage this
by myself, you know?</i>

800
00:42:45,494 --> 00:42:47,261
I'll do my bit.

801
00:42:47,262 --> 00:42:50,097
Think it'll earn you some
brownie points from Archie?

802
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,402
Remember, I've been here
a lot longer than you.

803
00:42:54,403 --> 00:42:55,736
<i>Exactly.</i>

804
00:42:55,737 --> 00:42:58,472
He would have made
his move by now...

805
00:42:58,473 --> 00:43:00,974
if he was interested.

806
00:43:00,975 --> 00:43:03,611
You want him, you've got
a fight on your hands.

807
00:43:03,612 --> 00:43:06,246
<i>- Fair enough.
- ( car approaching )</i>

808
00:43:06,247 --> 00:43:07,948
Here we go.

809
00:43:09,718 --> 00:43:13,187
Coo-ee!
Yoo-hoo!

810
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:14,988
<i>Hello!</i>

811
00:43:22,397 --> 00:43:25,165
Thanks goodness
you're here, officer.

812
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:27,267
We seem to have
broken down.

813
00:43:27,268 --> 00:43:30,938
Out here
- in the middle of nowhere.

814
00:43:30,939 --> 00:43:32,973
All on our lonesomes.

815
00:43:32,974 --> 00:43:36,276
Can't help you, I'm afraid.
We're on a manhunt.

816
00:43:36,277 --> 00:43:38,145
Well, so are we.

817
00:43:38,146 --> 00:43:40,614
( giggling )

818
00:43:42,484 --> 00:43:44,852
I suppose I could
spare 10 minutes.

819
00:43:46,822 --> 00:43:49,223
Is anybody out there?
Will somebody speak to me?

820
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:51,592
That's the second time
you've searched the place.

821
00:43:51,593 --> 00:43:54,695
- We're not hiding anything.
- He was in there, I spoke to him.

822
00:43:54,696 --> 00:43:57,398
Even your ranger says there's
something funny going on.

823
00:43:57,399 --> 00:44:00,401
That's the great thing about
Duncan, a vivid imagination.

824
00:44:00,402 --> 00:44:02,370
One of the reasons
we employ him.

825
00:44:02,371 --> 00:44:05,740
- Explain the yellow coats.
- This is the highlands, it rains a lot.

826
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:08,376
- Arrest him. Make him talk.
- Mr. McCullen,

827
00:44:08,377 --> 00:44:11,912
we both know this is a pathetic
attempt to sully my family name.

828
00:44:11,913 --> 00:44:14,314
- Why would that be?
- An incident with a painting.

829
00:44:14,315 --> 00:44:16,650
<i>Perhaps you'd like
to fill in the details,</i>

830
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:19,019
explain your little
business enterprise.

831
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,390
Look- maybe
I was mistaken.

832
00:44:22,391 --> 00:44:24,925
So this is another
wild-goose chase?

833
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:29,864
Do you know what the penalty is
for wasting police time?

834
00:44:34,135 --> 00:44:36,637
<i>( plane approaching )</i>

835
00:44:36,638 --> 00:44:39,740
If that will be all, gentlemen.
I do have an estate to run.

836
00:44:39,741 --> 00:44:41,876
What's that?

00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:46,313
<i>Archie:
Sawmill?</i>

838
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,974
I want you to know
how sorry I am.

839
00:45:13,975 --> 00:45:16,510
Hector: No need for all
that. Let's get you on board.

840
00:45:16,511 --> 00:45:18,479
This is for you.

841
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,715
And this is for Archie.
Open them later.

842
00:45:21,716 --> 00:45:24,084
Thanks,
bon voyage, Terry.

843
00:45:24,085 --> 00:45:26,520
Goodbye, captain.
Goodbye.

844
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:28,756
Take care
of yourself.

845
00:45:28,757 --> 00:45:31,425
Mind how you go.
Don't fall in.

846
00:45:31,426 --> 00:45:33,828
<i>( Hector chuckles )</i>

847
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:36,029
All the best.

848
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:37,932
Have a good trip.

849
00:45:40,034 --> 00:45:42,235
Stop!

850
00:45:42,236 --> 00:45:44,071
Enemy approaching.

851
00:45:44,072 --> 00:45:46,507
<i>I'll hold them off
as long as I can.</i>

852
00:45:47,776 --> 00:45:49,510
Stop that plane!

853
00:45:51,613 --> 00:45:53,447
I said, stop!

854
00:45:59,921 --> 00:46:02,289
You two are in
a lot of trouble!

855
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:06,326
- Why would that be? - Aiding and
abetting the escape of a fugitive!

856
00:46:06,327 --> 00:46:08,061
<i>Hector:
Fugitive?</i>

857
00:46:08,062 --> 00:46:12,332
- Did you see a fugitive?
- No, definitely not. How about you two?

858
00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:16,871
No, I didn't
think so.

859
00:46:49,504 --> 00:46:52,305
So- that's it.

860
00:46:52,306 --> 00:46:54,708
That's it, indeed.

861
00:46:54,709 --> 00:46:56,844
They've got no evidence.
They know it.

862
00:46:56,845 --> 00:46:58,812
My two clever boys.

863
00:46:58,813 --> 00:47:01,114
It was a team effort.
Well done, Dunc.

864
00:47:01,115 --> 00:47:03,483
I told you I could
do it, didn't I?

865
00:47:03,484 --> 00:47:06,319
I always had every-
every faith in you.

866
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,321
Toad left this
for you, Archie.

867
00:47:13,494 --> 00:47:15,495
It's a check.

868
00:47:15,496 --> 00:47:17,364
ï¿½2,000.

869
00:47:17,365 --> 00:47:19,600
"To cover the cost
of the painting,

870
00:47:19,601 --> 00:47:21,735
or be like 'the Piper'
and blow it. "

871
00:47:24,205 --> 00:47:26,473
What's that?

872
00:47:26,474 --> 00:47:28,475
His...

873
00:47:28,476 --> 00:47:29,910
military cross.

874
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,325
So you've still got your
sharp, tactical brain

875
00:47:45,326 --> 00:47:48,462
and now a medal to go
with it. How does it feel?

876
00:47:48,463 --> 00:47:51,398
It's friendships that
are important, Molly.

877
00:47:51,399 --> 00:47:53,033
Not gongs.

878
00:47:54,569 --> 00:47:56,136
Night-night.

879
00:47:56,137 --> 00:47:58,371
Good night, my darling.

880
00:48:06,314 --> 00:48:07,948
( sighs )

881
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:12,285
Ah!
