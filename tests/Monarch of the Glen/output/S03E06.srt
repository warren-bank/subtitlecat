1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,969
Welcome to Glenbogle,
heart of the highlands.

2
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,004
I take it you're
working for Stella?

3
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:42,341
- Sorry?
- She always been great at motivating people,

4
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,343
but getting them
to stand out in traffic?

5
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,145
She's really excelled
herself.

6
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,315
We're here, henry.
Drive on.

7
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,685
<i>Duncan: He said he was a colleague.</i>

8
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,688
A colleague wouldn't drop by
in a chauffeur-driven jag.

9
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,057
If you ask me,
that's her boss.

10
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:01,293
I'll bet he's giving her
a rocker.

11
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,463
If she's in trouble,
we're all in trouble.

12
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,899
It's a family business.
They're set in their ways.

13
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,237
We sent you here to
teach them some new ways.

14
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,539
You're meant to beat
this lot, not join them.

15
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,542
It would be a shame to go
native up here on your own,

16
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,378
in this fresh air
and fine scenery.

17
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,679
I hadn't noticed.

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,015
I'll be back
in a week.

19
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,618
You ought to have something
worth showing me by then.

20
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,220
Give them hell.

21
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,230
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

22
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,501
The bridge has been
open for three weeks.

23
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,503
Since that time
each of you

24
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,505
has had an income target
to achieve,

25
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,139
and I want to hear
progress reports.

26
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,108
Molly!

27
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,944
Short breaks for people
who want to paint watercolors?

28
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,779
Ah, yes!

29
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,417
Well, I built a subsection
on the web site

30
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,485
with an automated
response routine,

31
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:38,424
and I filled in lots about the
friendly staff and hands-on activities.

32
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,025
How many replies
have you had?

33
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,395
Just one- a chap who thought
we were a massage parlor.

34
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,564
( snickering )

35
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,065
Oh, yes.
That's hilarious.

36
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,735
<i>Almost as funny as
the cash flow figures.</i>

37
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,271
Duncan, your job

38
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,673
was to promote
Glenbogle locally

39
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,842
as a tourist
destination.

40
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,313
Right. yes...

41
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,815
I'm still evaluating

42
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:07,720
the most cost-effective
approach...

43
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,787
( giggling )

44
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:12,824
For enhancing
the ongoing... thingy.

45
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,994
You're still out there waving
like a loony at passing cars?

46
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,997
If you get run over, it will
save me the bother of firing you.

47
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,333
<i>Hector!</i>

48
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,502
- Sorry?
- Have you even been listening?

49
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,938
Not really. You seem to
be discussing commerce.

50
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:29,174
A gentleman does not
sully himself

51
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,176
with anything
so vulgar as trade.

52
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,647
As the eldest surviving
member of the MacDonalds,

53
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:37,249
I have the dignity
of the clan to consider.

54
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,252
<i>How much dignity will you
or your clan have</i>

55
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,521
when you're living
in a caravan park?

56
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:47,893
Maybe I haven't made
myself clear. Time's up!

57
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,329
Either we see
some results this week,

58
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,863
or I go back
to a desk job,

59
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,400
and Glenbogle goes under
the hammer- it's that simple.

60
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,268
Archie!

61
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,138
I've been in touch with
several national newspapers,

62
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,342
<i>trying to stoke up interest in
Glenbogle as a tourist destination,</i>

63
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,678
which is why we have
a journalist

64
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,447
<i>from the Sunday Courier
arriving this evening.</i>

65
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:12,017
<i>We have two days to show him
what we have to offer.</i>

66
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,720
This is our chance to put
Glenbogle on the map.

67
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,389
A good write-up from him
will not only impress the bank,

68
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,058
but it will give us more
business than we can handle.

69
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,060
That's excellent,
Archie.

70
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,895
<i>Thank you.</i>

71
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,798
<i>Now...</i>

72
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,734
<i>I shouldn't have to
say this, but I will.</i>

73
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,903
We treat this guy
like royalty.

74
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,073
<i>Anything he wants,
he gets.</i>

75
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,242
And if that means
a piggyback up Ben Bogle,

76
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,978
you all form an orderly queue.
What's his name?

77
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,815
Lawrence,
Graham Lawrence.

78
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:46,051
Graham Lawrence?

79
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,068
Graham.

80
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,403
How did you know
it was me?

81
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,438
- Welcome to Glenbogle.
- It's magnificent.

82
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,240
Best kept secret
in the highlands,

83
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,108
here's hoping
it will stay that way.

84
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,611
Thanks for coming to meet me.
I would have caught the bus.

85
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,847
Don't worry. The next
one's not until Tuesday.

86
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,657
Oh, Duncan.

87
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,629
Cheer up.

88
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,198
Think positively.

89
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,634
I am-
I'm thinking

90
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,203
I'm positively crap
at this job.

91
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,472
So, Stella gave you
a ticking off,

92
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:44,142
she gave me one, too. We've just
got to get those visitors in.

93
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,679
Or what?
Thanks for trying,

94
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,648
but let's face it,

95
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,184
she can hardly
sack you, can she?

96
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:55,854
This is my father,
Hector MacDonald.

97
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,188
- Graham Lawrence.
- Delighted.

98
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:59,324
Heard you were coming.
What can we get you?

99
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,460
A crate of something,
or do you prefer cash?

100
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,328
- Father, please.
- This is a journalist.

101
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,697
But that doesn't mean
he's open to bribery.

102
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,866
But don't let that
stop you from trying.

103
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,735
Let's soften you up
with a glass of malt.

104
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,169
Sounds great.

105
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,740
And this our
housekeeper, Lexie.

106
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,442
<i>- hello.
- Hello.</i>

107
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,778
Hello-
you're Graham.

108
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,247
I'll put him
in a suite.

109
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,083
Big double bed.
Plenty of room to maneuver.

110
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:28,019
( gagging,
coughing )

111
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,355
Father, are you
all right?

112
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,391
( gasping )
Fine. I've been poisoned.

113
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,794
This isn't a single malt.
It's boiled bog water.

114
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,997
<i>It's supersaver blended,
7.99 a bottle.</i>

115
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,200
This is Stella Moon,
our financial controller.

116
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,169
<i>Lucrezia Borgia
to her friends.</i>

117
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,572
- Stella.
- Hello, Graham.

118
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,941
- Fancy meeting you here.
- You know each other?

119
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,308
<i>- Graham: yes.
- Stella: No.</i>

120
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,878
Sort of.
We're married.

121
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,580
Separated.

122
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,615
<i>We'd be divorced, but Graham
can't spell his own name.</i>

123
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,383
Is this an ambush?
Are you planning

124
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,586
to throw me in a dungeon
and feed me on scraps?

125
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,054
Sadly, I'm not in charge
of your accommodation.

126
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,524
<i>Lexie:
Hmm-mm.</i>

127
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:09,862
Married? funny,
she never mentioned that.

128
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,631
It was a whirlwind romance. Marry
at Gretna Green, repent at Carlisle.

129
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,833
I thought she was
working for a bank.

130
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:18,504
Yes, she is.
I'm sorry, Graham,

131
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,138
we really had no idea.
This must be terribly awkward.

132
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,241
Oh, no. please.
I'm here to do a job.

133
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,110
You must treat me
like any other visitor

134
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,179
who has met his wife for the
first time in three years.

135
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,948
Any chance
of that whiskey?

136
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,216
I'm afraid not.

137
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,752
I'm using it
to clean the lavatory.

138
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,627
Yes, I'm married.
I used to wear a ring,

139
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,896
but I accidentally threw it
off the bridge.

140
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,297
You knew he was coming as
soon as I mentioned his name.

141
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,967
I was hoping it was going to
be a different Graham Lawrence.

142
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,402
It isn't.
It's your husband.

143
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,571
Since you didn't warn me,
we're stuck with him.

144
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,339
What would you
have done?

145
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,075
Put him off, told him we
got the dates mixed up,

146
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,412
- got bubonic plague.
- To spare my feelings?

147
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,548
No, to spare his.

148
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,316
Whatever went on between you
is none of my business,

149
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:07,920
but this is about Glenbogle.
Be polite to him.

150
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,121
<i>I'm sure he'll do
his best to be objective.</i>

151
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,123
<i>Seems like
a decent bloke.</i>

152
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,192
You're not a very good
judge of character, then!

153
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,529
Obviously not.

154
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,070
That was
an amazing dinner.

155
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,338
<i>I'm looking forward
to this haggis flambe.</i>

156
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:30,676
- Stella's rationed the brandy.
- That's our Stella.

157
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,344
Always had to keep
a lid on the fire.

158
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:36,014
Here we go.

159
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,215
- Can I help you?
- Oops!

160
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,084
I must have got
the rooms mixed up.

161
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,352
Understandable. I've
only been here two months!

162
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:43,889
Tell you what, why
don't you two just share?

163
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,625
Seeing as you're here-
and you're married.

164
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,760
Are we short
of rooms, suddenly?

165
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,529
Just trying to save on
laundry bills. Never mind.

166
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,366
This was your idea?

167
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:58,770
Weekends away with someone you
hate, they're the next big thing.

168
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:02,140
I still have your picture by
my bed, scares off burglars.

169
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,009
I used to have
a little statue of you,

170
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,612
but I threw it away. I couldn't
fit any more pins into it.

171
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,615
I didn't know country pursuits
included sniping and unarmed combat.

172
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:13,218
Well, if ignorance is bliss, you
must be the happiest man alive.

173
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,820
Shut the door
when you leave.

174
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:33,371
Yes! a booking
for a party of five.

175
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,473
Oh- for the year
after next.

176
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,342
That's hardly going
to impress Stella.

177
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,386
- Oh, holy mother.
- What?

178
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,156
It's the advertising rates
for the local paper.

179
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,491
Nobody reads it.

180
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,226
They use it
to wrap chips in.

181
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,928
Can't you afford
an advertisement?

182
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,597
Aye, maybe.
If I sell a kidney.

183
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:01,633
You'll have to ask
Stella for the money.

184
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,736
I'd rather sell
the kidney.

185
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,404
<i>Lexie:
I'll get that.</i>

186
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,573
<i>Graham:
I can manage.</i>

187
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,175
You're rushed off your feet as it is.

188
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,380
Would you like
more of anything?

189
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,715
I'd like more
of everything.

190
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,250
<i>The food is
just fabulous.</i>

191
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:22,688
Did you sleep well?
Bed's not too lumpy?

192
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:26,391
It was a bit big-
and empty.

193
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,861
So, Stella didn't pay
any midnight visits then?

194
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:33,198
I did feel a chill, but that
was a draft from the window.

195
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,466
( giggling )
She's probably

196
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:37,635
keeping you in suspense,
making you suffer.

197
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:39,470
Tell me about it.
I married her.

198
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:42,074
So, what happened?

199
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,276
( sighs )
Well...

200
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,946
she cared more about her career
than about us,

201
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:52,383
and more about her clients
than about me.

202
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:54,953
I suppose she spends
a lot of time with Archie?

203
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,989
Another condemned man
eating a hearty breakfast.

204
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,658
Graham, I'm Golly.

205
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,294
I'll be taking you out
for a bit of fishing.

206
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,396
You know anything
about flies?

207
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:08,600
Oh, yes. All my trousers have them.

208
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,703
Ah... right.

209
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,541
Ah, Brian,
dear boy,

210
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,510
you're a sight for sore eyes,
and parched palates.

211
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:22,380
One crate of assorted
single malts.

212
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,249
Splendid.
Where do I sign?

213
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,551
You don't. do you have
a purchase order for this?

214
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,519
- Purchase order?
- Stella! really!

215
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,322
Mr. MacDonald's word has
always been good enough for us.

216
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,658
I'm amazed your firm
is still in business.

217
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,660
Take it back.
We're not signing for it.

218
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,329
Do you expect me to drink
that battery acid you bought?

219
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,331
Thanks, sorry
about the mix-up. bye.

220
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,234
<i>Hector:
This is outrageous!</i>

221
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,269
Brian's been delivering
my malts for years.

222
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,837
I know, my bank's
paying for it!

223
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,073
The only way we're
gonna get our money back

224
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,176
is if we put your liver on
display as a medical phenomenon!

225
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,078
How dare you!
Can't a gentleman have

226
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,147
a glass of half-decent
whiskey in the evening?

227
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,548
Certainly, if a gentleman's
willing to work for it,

228
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:59,550
which you seem
totally unwilling to do-

229
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:01,153
or are you just
incapable?

230
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:04,022
I am going for a walk.
I may be some time!

231
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,792
Take back the empties
while you're at it!

232
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,032
You are still into blood
sports up here, then?

233
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,536
<i>- Duncan: Stella-
- what?!</i>

234
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,538
Nothing.

235
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:26,244
Another advert?

236
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,947
No, a letter
of resignation.

237
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,050
Oh, Duncan. There's no need for that.

238
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,920
You're right. I can always
call her from the job center.

239
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,589
Why don't you try
niche marketing?

240
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,960
There's no point.
She's only six months old.

241
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,594
Who is?

242
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:45,197
My niece.

243
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,865
No, I mean,

244
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,867
you find where
the customers are

245
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,436
and then you target
them directly.

246
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,338
( softly )
Oh.

247
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,940
Oh!

248
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,418
Golly: Remember, a lot of the action

249
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,188
is in the wrist.
That's it. remember,

250
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,357
try to blend in
with the river.

251
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,492
Very zen.

252
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,027
Oops!
( chuckles )

253
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,231
Try not to blend in
that much.

254
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,432
Has Stella
tried this?

255
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,002
She looks like she needs
to lighten up a bit.

256
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,271
No, the bank's
on her back.

257
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,139
<i>Graham:
Same old story.</i>

258
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,542
So tied up with work,
life just passes her by.

259
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:34,346
How long were you two
together?

260
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:37,949
Two years. Seems like
longer, it was so intense.

261
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,384
Just try it
over there.

262
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,454
There.

263
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,091
<i>Graham:
We were young.</i>

264
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,859
We were both
a bit nuts.

265
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,496
If I had my time again,
I'd do exactly the same.

266
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,800
Love like that-
it's the most amazing rush.

267
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,503
Could never last,
more's the pity.

268
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,907
So, would you two like
to get back together?

269
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,175
Nah!

270
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,745
<i>We've burned
our bridges.</i>

271
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,448
We got plenty of experience
mending bridges 'round here.

272
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,284
That right, Archie?

273
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,386
Yep.

274
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,322
<i>Duncan:
Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

275
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,925
gather 'round.
Visit Glenbogle House,

276
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,793
- in the heart of-
- never heard of it!

277
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:26,431
A magnificent, stately home
by Glenbogle loch.

278
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,499
Every stone soaked
in history.

279
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,767
Is this one of them?

280
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,304
If you fancy a tour,

281
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,139
there's a coach
leaving in 10 minutes

282
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,873
from in front
of the post office.

283
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:38,009
You don't want
to hang around here.

284
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,677
Too much litter.

285
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,012
Hang on,
I was here first.

286
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,613
It's not a question
of being first.

287
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:44,382
It's a question
of being the best.

288
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,852
Leave the tour business
to professionals, eh?

289
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,721
View the highlights
of the highlands

290
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:52,390
from a fully heated coach,

291
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,328
with panoramic views,
and an expert guide.

292
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,862
Hang on!

293
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,931
I can give you a tour
of the highlands,

294
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:03,401
in a four-wheel drive
with heating, and a radio.

295
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,504
If you don't mind helping him
change that wheel first.

296
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,181
What's all this?

297
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,416
I thought that
Graham and Stella

298
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,586
could have a wee...
you know, tete-a-tete.

299
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,588
And Stella's
agreed to this?

300
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,092
No, not exactly.

301
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,094
You haven't
told her yet?

302
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,262
Did you two
have plans?

303
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,931
No. actually,
I think it's a good idea.

304
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,867
I'll talk to her.

305
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,172
<i>No, Archie, I'll have
to listen to him.</i>

306
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,142
And I can't, not even
for your precious Glenbogle.

307
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,144
It's dinner,
that's all.

308
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,146
I don't think
it's gonna be that bad.

309
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,448
What do you mean?
What's he been saying?

310
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,285
Forget about Glenbogle.
Do it for yourself.

311
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,453
If this works out,

312
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,823
we will be beating off
customers with a big stick.

313
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,893
Lexie's doing trout...

314
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,364
the way you like it.

315
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,134
Mm, plenty of strychnine
on his.

316
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,069
( sighs )

317
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:15,073
Excuse me.
I have to get changed.

318
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,481
( sighs )

319
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,385
I knew it was
too good to last.

320
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,855
Archie seems to think
you'd appreciate my company.

321
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,391
<i>That Archie,
he's such a wag.</i>

322
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,993
Whatever happened
between us,

323
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:38,196
don't take it out on the people
here. They don't deserve it.

324
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,998
There is such a thing
as journalistic ethics.

325
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:43,068
<i>I knew that, I didn't know
you knew that.</i>

326
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,703
I've never mixed my business
with my personal life.

327
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,106
<i>Stella: Oh, no, you're a
consummate professional.</i>

328
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,575
<i>All those diaries
of your conquests don't count.</i>

329
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:54,345
<i>How did they go again?
There was anna-</i>

330
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,081
"three out of 10
for technique,

331
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,515
10 out of 10
for enthusiasm. "

332
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,650
<i>Then there was julie
from accounts,</i>

333
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,219
<i>and suzy
from the take-away.</i>

334
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,687
<i>Graham:
They were diaries.</i>

335
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,889
You weren't supposed
to read them.

336
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,491
Those women
certainly weren't.

337
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,194
But of course, you had to
copy them and pass them around.

338
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,063
Everyone's entitled
to read their own appraisal.

339
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,532
I've paid for my sins.

340
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,303
We both made
stupid mistakes.

341
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:19,870
Yeah, you were mine.

342
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,340
Mine was making the one
woman I ever really loved

343
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,009
<i>hate my guts.</i>

344
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,978
<i>Now, I've gone
and told her.</i>

345
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,916
Father.
There you are.

346
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,685
Of course, I am.
I belong here.

347
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,455
I'm like that house,
a crumbling old ruin,

348
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,225
expensive to run,
and serving no purpose.

349
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,560
Stella was
too harsh on you,

350
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,562
<i>but she's got
her own problems.</i>

351
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,731
She was right.
I am an aristocrat.

352
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,101
No marketable skills.
I'm a relic,

353
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,769
a figurehead
on a sinking ship.

354
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,371
Come inside,
and have a drink.

355
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,640
Hah! that mouthwash
she calls whiskey?

356
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,975
There are more dignified
ways of ending it all.

357
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:01,012
That is enough!
You are a MacDonald,

358
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,181
<i>the elder
of a fighting clan.</i>

359
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:07,385
We have never been driven out
by fire, sword or siege,

360
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,087
and we will not be
defeated by spreadsheets.

361
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:13,224
I won't have this pathetic
maudlin defeatism.

362
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,526
Don't bark at me, boy!

363
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,394
You aren't too big
to go across my knee.

364
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,864
That's more like it.
We'll find a job for you,

365
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,133
even if it's frightening away
the tourists.

366
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,935
Now, come inside before
the midges suck you dry.

367
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,620
I promised
I'd never admit this,

368
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,955
but the worst thing

369
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:48,125
is seeing you so happy,
and successful.

370
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:50,961
<i>I could kick myself,</i>

371
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:53,097
knowing that I'll never
be a part of that now,

372
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,466
not like Archie.

373
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,636
Archie?

374
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,372
I've seen the way
he looks at you.

375
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,840
( gasps )

376
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,343
You always had
a lively imagination.

377
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,044
I'd never spoil it
for you.

378
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,214
I've already hurt you
enough for a lifetime.

379
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:13,318
<i>What happened back then with
you and that businessman,</i>

380
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,153
<i>it was my fault.
I was selfish,</i>

381
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:18,223
and I was cruel.

382
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,491
I drove you to it.

383
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,261
<i>Forgive yourself even
if you can't forgive me.</i>

384
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,963
<i>You have every right to
despise me. I don't know why</i>

385
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,566
<i>you didn't push the
divorce through ages ago.</i>

386
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,235
Why didn't you?

387
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,169
I never got
around to it.

388
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,340
Super-efficient Stella
skimping on the paperwork?

389
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,941
<i>I don't think so.</i>

390
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,245
You don't want
to say it's over,

391
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,980
because it isn't.

392
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,088
I'm really tired.

393
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,090
<i>Remember that poem
at our wedding?</i>

394
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,760
"I have spread my dreams
under your feet-"

395
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,295
don't.

396
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,130
<i>"Tread softly...</i>

397
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,765
for you tread
on my dreams. "

398
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14,312
( sniffling )

399
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,594
( sobbing )

400
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,532
<i>( knocking at door )</i>

401
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,803
( beeps )

402
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,978
Hi. I just came
to turn down your bed.

403
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:50,047
No woman has ever
turned down my bed.

404
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,684
Except Stella.

405
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,519
I don't know what
that girl wants.

406
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,821
She won't have me back,
but she won't say it's over.

407
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,757
- It's torture.
- That's Stella for you.

408
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,693
What time do
you finish?

409
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:04,161
That's me
finished now. why?

410
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,865
I could use some company,
just to talk.

411
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:08,966
Maybe have
a nightcap?

412
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,136
Okay, I'll ask
Archie to pop in.

413
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,339
Archie?

414
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,240
I'm up at 5:00.

415
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,710
Got to sweep
those chimneys.

416
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,712
Maybe I should do
some work on my article.

417
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:23,648
Fine. happy typing.

418
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,957
<i>Stella:
Money for photocopying?</i>

419
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,460
<i>So you've given out
all 200 fliers?</i>

420
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,295
<i>Duncan: Not exactly...
they sort of flew away.</i>

421
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,631
<i>Stella: So far your marketing campaign</i>

422
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,967
has cost us
160 quid,

423
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,102
including a new tire
for the Land Rover,

424
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,137
and what have you
got to show for it?

425
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:48,806
Building
brand awareness...?

426
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,308
By leaflets in the local
sheep? You're fired!

427
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,478
Your services are
no longer required.

428
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:57,948
Don't feel bad about it. In five
days, we'll all be out of a job.

429
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,650
- You're not fired.
- Archie!

430
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,819
You're gonna go out there
and make it happen.

431
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,422
- No second chances!
- Go on. go.

432
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,994
I have had just about
enough of this.

433
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,729
<i>First you bite
my father's head off,</i>

434
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,330
<i>and then you try
to fire Duncan</i>

435
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:16,200
for doing the best
he can with nothing.

436
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,936
Face it, the problem is Graham.
You have to solve that problem.

437
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,271
- Archie!
- Not now, mother.

438
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,972
It's Hector. His bed
hasn't been slept in.

439
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,778
( sighs )
All right...

440
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,780
you take the grounds,
stop by the loch.

441
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,981
- I'll take the pick-up.
- What about Graham?

442
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,350
I'm supposed to give him a
watercolor lesson this morning.

443
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,652
Stick to that.

444
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:38,355
We are gonna find
my father. come on.

445
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:06,216
On your bike, son.
These punters are taken.

446
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:09,520
We don't have to waste
our energy competing.

447
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,056
Why not make Glenbogle
a stop on your tour?

448
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,390
That dump?

449
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,160
But it's got everything
your customers want.

450
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,229
It's got beautiful grounds
and a visitors' center,

451
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,998
<i>with souvenirs
and crafts-</i>

452
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,635
and all the usual. It's amazing
the rubbish these people will buy.

453
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,237
It would be good business for all of us.

454
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:31,275
- Why should I?
- Like I said-

455
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:34,612
never mind that nonsense.
Why should I bring my punters,

456
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,347
desperate to blow
their hard-earned

457
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:40,985
pennies to your place?
Much obliged, donald.

458
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,820
What? did you think I brought
them here for the food?

459
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,589
Humph-
it's disgusting.

460
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,257
I can't afford
backhanders.

461
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:49,126
But maybe when we
get up and running...

462
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,996
good luck getting
business. You'll need it.

463
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:58,803
<i>Graham: This week has been a revelation.</i>

464
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,872
<i>Molly: I hope you tell
that to your readers.</i>

465
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:03,875
Sorry, I'm being
forward.

466
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:06,210
Not at all. I've already
finished the first draft.

467
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,946
I think you could
safely call it a "rave. "

468
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,552
Tate Modern,
here I come.

469
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,420
All you need now
is the berry.

470
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,255
Well, thank you.

471
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:23,027
He hasn't been here and he's
not hiding at Kilwillie's-

472
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,295
Archie, I've got
better things to do

473
00:24:25,296 --> 00:24:27,131
than hunt down
"Bonnie Prince Hector. "

474
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,767
You should've thought of that
before you laid into him.

475
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,269
I know you're under
a lot of pressure, Stella,

476
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,906
but so is he.
He's an old man,

477
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:38,275
not some dodgy client creaming
off the business account.

478
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:42,212
Did you ever have a week when
everything that could go wrong, did?

479
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:45,016
Have you ever been
to Glenbogle?

480
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:47,384
My boss thinks
I've lost my touch,

481
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:50,421
and he's
probably right.

482
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:53,424
Now Graham appears
asking me to take him back.

483
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:57,762
<i>When I married him,
I was making a commitment.</i>

484
00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:01,398
He was making
contingency plans.

485
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:05,803
He just carried on
drinking and... carrying on.

486
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:09,273
After months of misery,
I made this stupid mistake.

487
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,108
You don't have
to tell me this.

488
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,477
I slept
with a client... once.

489
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:17,114
Graham found out, and the bank
found out and I had to quit.

490
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:20,150
So I moved to Lascelles
and started again.

491
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:24,121
<i>I only lost a few years'
promotion and all my self-respect.</i>

492
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,125
Now I'm making
the same mistakes again.

493
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,761
Oh, come on. You haven't
slept with a client.

494
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,296
<i>I might
as well have.</i>

495
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:36,500
I can't make Glenbogle
pay its way...

496
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,704
because I've got
too close to the business.

497
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:43,074
I'm going to get fired,
and I'm going to deserve it.

498
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:46,978
You always seemed
so certain of yourself,

499
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,780
so in control. I never
realized that you were so-

500
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,016
- screwed up?
- No, human.

501
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:56,220
You can't give in,
Stella, not now.

502
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,991
<i>You're not alone. You've
got all of us behind you.</i>

503
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,659
We won't let them
railroad you.

504
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,594
What about Glenbogle?

505
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,063
Glenbogle's nothing
without its people.

506
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,399
<i>I'm afraid
you're one of us now.</i>

507
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,502
But I won't tell them that
if you don't.

508
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,806
<i>- let's get some lunch.
- What about Hector?</i>

509
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:18,342
We'll dig a big pit,

510
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,778
drop in a bottle of malt,
and have him back by sundown.

511
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,813
( chuckles )

512
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,590
We can eat at the bar.
Why don't you order something?

513
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,893
I'll find a phone
and call in.

514
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,730
Hector: Now note the rich amber color,

515
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,799
the drops that stick
to the side.

516
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,401
Precious oils,
the soul of the dram.

517
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:48,205
( sniffs ) Mmm, strong personality,
well-seasoned and mature.

518
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,778
Hello, Hector.

519
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:57,682
( sighs )
Is there anywhere safe?

520
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,483
I'm sorry I was
a bit hard on you.

521
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:01,686
No, you weren't. Perfectly
natural to expect me

522
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,721
to earn my own keep.
I'm just good for nothing.

523
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:07,424
In that hat, we could always
hire you out as a scarecrow.

524
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,395
Father, where
have you been?

525
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:15,032
Did you know this place
has 35 single malts?

526
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,034
I'm gently working
my way through them.

527
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,303
- Come on home.
- There's the small matter...

528
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,138
of the bill.

529
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:27,044
Stella, you are the soul
of generosity and forbearance.

530
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,147
Lead the way,
Archie.

531
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,983
( low )
Get a move on.

532
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,987
What was he doing with
the stuff, bathing in it?

533
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,424
( sighs )
What's the use?

534
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:43,660
They just follow him like sheep
and he fleeces them.

535
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,897
"The art of war"?

536
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:49,867
A lot of useful advice in there
for the aspiring businessman.

537
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,902
"Employ deception.

00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:55,773
Although you are competent,

539
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:59,043
- I can manage that.
- Keep going.

00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,417
Sheep stealing, Duncan,
has a long and noble history.

543
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:10,254

the aristocracy started?

Here we are.

548
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:27,138
Dinner's in an hour,
and I've run you a bath.

549
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,506
Is that our report?

550
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:32,376
Oh-hh, any chance
of a back rub?

551
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,246
Stella's still out
with Archie.

552
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:38,182
- When the cat's away-
- your bath's getting cold.

553
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,350
What are you
doing here, Lexie,

554
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,720
waiting on these
inbred aristos

555
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,990
with their
idiot retainers?

556
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,492
You're far too bright and
beautiful to live in this hole.

557
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,596
I'm on the run
from the police.

558
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,899
Really?

559
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,567
I took an axe
to my boyfriend

560

he was married.

561
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,040
Dinner's in an hour?

562
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,242
Dress informal.

563
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,093
For goodness sake,
I just went for a walk.

564
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,463
- Didn't think I'd need a note from the prefect.
- You had us worried sick.

565
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:29,800
Why exactly? Apart from providing
endless hours of amusement,

566
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,136
<i>- what am I good for?
- Molly: oh, Hector.</i>

567
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:35,739
Lexie, what are you doing
with Graham's laptop?

568
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,642
Not much, it's
password-protected.

569
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:41,078
That's his private
property. The man is a guest.

570
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:43,447
The man is a creep.
I don't trust him.

571
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,216
He said he'd give us
a rave review.

572
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:48,752
<i>He said I lived in a hole with
a bunch of "inbred aristocrats. "</i>

573
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:52,156
Now, anyone want to make
a guess at the password?

574
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,094
- Try "stallion. "
- Excuse me?

575
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,196
Don't ask.

576
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,599
Okay...
"stallion. "

577
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,002

00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,976

If he hurts you,
he hurts all of us.

595

I suggest we tar and feather
him and send him packing.

No, slice him open and feed
his tripes to the fishes.

We can't stop him

Ah, Graham,
it's yourself.

I hope you've
broken in those boots.

618
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,601

I'm looking forward
to more stories.

620
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,905
Oh, no, son.
No tall tales today.

621
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,875
I think it's time you had a
real taste of the highlands.

622

And don't forget
your highland cuisine.

Graham!

627
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,369
A drop of the local
specialty?

628
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,704
One swig and you'll
be able to bring down

bare hands.

630
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,808

<i>Golly: sure.</i>

have a good day.

638
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:26,103
Look after him

639
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,771
Oh, I will.

640
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:31,175
I know how dangerous
the woods can be.

641
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,328
Rest stop.

642
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,697

minutes, we leave without you.

so finish up, please.

645
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,767
What happened
to the other driver?

646
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:34,538
Dodgy scotch.
Very nasty.

647
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:38,609
You don't want to know.
Come on, folks.

648
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,778
<i>Stella: He knew I was here. Look.</i>

649
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,881
He wrote an anonymous
letter to my boss

650
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,317
about why I left
mersey commercial.

651
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:50,387
It was no coincidence
at all, his coming here.

652
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:54,558
He's been looking for revenge
ever since I left him.

653
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,928
When you wrote him, it gave him
the perfect opportunity.

654
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:01,064
First, he tips off the bank,
then he slates Glenbogle.

655
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:03,733
We go bust,
and you get fired.

656
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:07,137
Your old man really knows
how to bear a grudge.

657
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:10,840
I wondered why you never trusted
anyone. You had good reason.

658
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:12,976
I never meet anyone
I could trust until-

659
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,981
what are those?

<i>Notes for Graham's article-

661
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,522
- Are you going to write it?
- And e-mail it in.

662
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,857
So when he comes
to submit the real one...

663
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:30,727
- he'll be too late.
- You hope.

664
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,729
If you've got a better plan,
I'm all ears.

665
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,131
You dictate, I'll type.

667
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,545
Get down.

Aye, you're right, Graham.
Well spotted.

<i>Probably some fox
marking his territory.</i>

676
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,810
Och, well, it'll cover up
the smell of your aftershave.

677
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,813
Come on.

00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:34,057
- We can't gush.
- Why not? we need the business.

681
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:37,961
We have to keep some
semblance of objectivity.

682
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,330
"Among Glenbogle's
eccentric charms

683
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,667
are its colorful staff-"

684
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,602
<i>"is its colorful staff. "
Staff is singular.</i>

685
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,937
- No, it's not, it's plural.
- It's a collective noun.

686
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:50,006
- It's singular.
- Who's writing this article?

687
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,543
Graham! his grammar's awful,
so yeah, have it your way.

688
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:04,621
- That's an idea.
- What?

689
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:07,190
You could hire me as a life
model for your painting courses.

690
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,161
I don't think there'll
be much of a demand

691
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,996
for you to get
your kit off.

692
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,031
There's not much
of a demand, anyway.

693
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:18,769
Maybe they'd pay me
to keep it on?

694
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,204
<i>It's not bad.</i>

695
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:27,544
"And I highly
recommend-"

696
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,212
<i>" warmly recommend it. "</i>

697
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:33,784
<i>"Warmly recommend it. "</i>

698
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:36,920
- 500 words.
- Probably needs a bit of polishing.

699
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,689
<i>Definitely needs
a bit of polishing.</i>

700
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,156
How long is Graham
gonna be out there?

701
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:43,327
- I'll plug us in.
- Where shall I send it?

702
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:45,529
- Find the e-mail address
of his paper. - Yes, got it.

703
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,932
<i>- Come on, come on
- voice: hello...?</i>

704
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,734
- Can't be back already?
- Stall him.

705
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,337
No, don't-
that switches it off.

706
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:57,474
Oh- Duncan,
what do you want?

707
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,509
Am I still fired?

708
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:03,814
<i>Duncan: Sorry about the short notice.</i>

709
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,115
"You must strike
when the foe is not prepared,

710
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:10,119
- and attack when he does not expect. "
- Duncan, you did it!

711
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,722
Well, I got them here.
What do I do with them now?

712
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,724
Send them back
from whence they came.

713
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,258
Give them a guided tour,
of course.

714
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,761
Better warn Lexie. She'll
be feeding the multitudes.

715
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:22,599
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Glenbogle,

716
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,968
the historic seat
of the MacDonald clan

717
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,070
for more than 500 years.

718
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,139
The house,
as you see it today,

719
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,743
<i>is a legacy of our
victorian forbearers,</i>

720
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:37,080
<i>who wanted to capture the
spirit of medieval architecture.</i>

721
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:40,550
<i>While these towering battlements
have never seen war...</i>

722
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,028
we nearly there yet?

723
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:56,900
Oh, not far.
We're almost halfway.

724
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,869
Halfway?

725
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,237
Get some food inside of you.
That'll keep your energy up.

726
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:09,245
Ah, a fine view,
Graham.

727
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:12,816
There are some people who think
this countryside is dreary.

728
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,852
Hard to believe, eh?

729
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,688
Yeah, fabulous.

730
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,896
What is this stuff?

731
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:31,367
I think I'm gonna
be sick.

732
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:32,936
<i>( retching )</i>

733
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,448
<i>( coughing )</i>

734
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:47,116
Any more of that soup?
It was wonderful.

735
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,593
I always say

736
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:59,162
if they don't have a price,
you can't afford them.

737
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,197
- Molly: I'm sorry?
- The watercolors.

738
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:04,801
<i>- They are for sale, aren't they?
- oh, yes, of course.</i>

739
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,637
That one is �30.

740
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,540
�30? do you
take checks?

741
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,776
We take anything
we can get.

742
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,250
<i>Man: ... the taste of the highlands.</i>

743
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:26,322
It will just sit on the
shelf, with the plum brandy.

744
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:27,691
Can I help at all?

745
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:30,360
My husband
insisted on buying

746
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,428
this whiskey
in the village.

747
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:34,163
I thought it
looked authentic.

748
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:36,666
May I?

749
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,002
Oh, yes.

750
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:41,137
12-year-old
Strathmona.

751
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,272
A fine malt. Don't
waste it on your friends.

752
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:46,142
He won't drink it.

753
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,511
I'm still trying
to acquire the taste.

754
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:50,547
A palate that can't
appreciate a single malt

755
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,082
is in sore need of education.
Come with me.

756
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:57,153
- We'd love to, but-
- no "buts. " this way.

757
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,058
You're taking us
round in circles.

758
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:06,062
I'm sorry, son. I know so
little about the countryside,

759
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:09,165
it all just looks
the same to me.

760
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:12,101
I see, that's
very cute.

761
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,437
I suppose Stella
put you up to this?

762
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,339
I enjoyed
your article.

763
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,975
I hope they print it
on nice absorbent paper.

764
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,845
I'm going back.

765
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:28,084
- I wouldn't go that way.
- You think I'm gonna listen to you?

766
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,291
You'll be able to say now that
you've really tasted the highlands.

767
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,427
( sputters )

768
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,863
All aboard please,
ladies and gents.

769
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:47,203
Thank you so much.
Do tell your friends.

770
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:53,977
He was right.
You know...

771
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:57,814
you could taste the peat
and the notes of smoke-

772
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:01,350
and the smell of heather.
It was Scotland in a glass.
773
00:42:01,351 --> 00:42:04,588
We didn't drink
all that, did we?

774
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:06,856
Where's the rest
of it?

775
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,826
Still in his
decanter.

776
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,808
Bye, do come again.

777
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:27,376
Hector: They were quite
well-behaved, for a rabble.

778
00:42:27,377 --> 00:42:29,445
I think I'll
give up tuition.

779
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:32,582
Painting for oneself
is much more rewarding.

780
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,097
This is the best view
of the loch.

781
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,234
What on earth is that?

782
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,105
Ughh!

783
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:57,674
Hikers.

784
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:01,011
<i>They go in the woods,
get lost for weeks on end</i>

785
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:04,914
and go mad- completely.
Tragic.

786
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,850
I'm glad we stuck
with a guided tour.

787
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:18,427
What have you
done with him?

788
00:43:18,428 --> 00:43:20,130
Is he not back yet?

789
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:23,466
Well, he won't starve.
He's got Lexie's sandwiches.

790
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:24,768
( chuckles )

791
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:28,738
You are finished.

792
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,908
Once they run my piece, you'll
be lucky if rats stay here.

793
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,610
<i>And you will be back
in your polyester twin set</i>

794
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:36,379
<i>flogging mortgages
over the phone.</i>

795
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,248
<i>It's not over until I
say it's over, sweetheart.</i>

796
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:42,518
You think you can rip my life
to bits and then just walk away?

797
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,453
Oh, Graham,
grow up!

798
00:43:44,454 --> 00:43:47,957
- We lived up to your review.
- Think that was a bad review?

799
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,927
<i>- You should see the latest draft.
- actually, we have.</i>

800
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,730
We've sent it off for you-
with a few amendments.

801
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,098
( phone rings )

802
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:59,335
Hello, Glenbogle House.
Yes, who's calling?

803
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:02,271
<i>Oh, you got it?
Good.</i>

804
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:06,475
It's your editor, calling to
say thanks for the article.

805
00:44:06,476 --> 00:44:08,845
You might want
to leave him well alone.

806
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:11,881
He won't be too impressed
if he hears you were writing

807
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,684
a libelous report
just to spite your ex-wife.

808
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:19,022
He can't speak at the moment.
Can I take a message?

809
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:21,925
His best piece
to date? really?

810
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:25,628
Going out this Sunday?
He'll be delighted.

811
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:29,966
You'll be seeing him soon. In
fact, he'll be leaving shortly.

812
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:37,406
I caught up on that
paperwork you asked about.

813
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,078
What do you know?

814
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,982
<i>I am a soon-to-be
published journalist.</i>

815
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:48,184
There's nothing
to brag about, Archie.

816
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,286
<i>( door slams )</i>

817
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:54,557
<i>Stella: I have to admit it,
Duncan. You came up with the goods.</i>

818
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:56,626
<i>- well done.
- Thanks very much.</i>

819
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,896
How much did we
clear on the tour?

820
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:06,202
How much did you charge them?
You allowed for the meal?

821
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,872
Yes.

822
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,274
Actually,
it was sort of-

823
00:45:13,443 --> 00:45:17,180
- what you would call-
- a pilot scheme?

824
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:20,616
- A loss leader.
- A what?!

825
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:22,652
Ah, you're here.
Mr. Sweeney to see you.

826
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,821
Sit!

827
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,858
Can I help you?

828
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,860
I might have known.

829
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:33,930
This fella took a party
of my punters around here,

830
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:37,566
<i>after somebody
locked me in the toilet.</i>

831
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:40,236
I see.
How obliging of him.

832
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,971
<i>The thing is...</i>

833
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,674
a lot of them want to come
back with their friends.

834
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,943
<i>I was wondering</i>

835
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:49,612
if we might come to some
sort of arrangement?

836
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:52,282
Give Mr. Sweeney
a seat.

837
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,352
The thing is,
any tour

838
00:45:56,353 --> 00:46:00,123
would have to include
a malt-tasting course.

839
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:02,091
I'm sorry?

840
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,094
The old codger who teaches
people whiskey-tasting.

841
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:08,264
I've got six punters
down for a session already.

842
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,266
Get Hector back
in here, please.

843
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,735
Yes, ma'am.

844
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:18,708
I still can't
believe it.

845
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,711
50 quid a throw,
and they bring the whiskey.

846
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:24,580
All I have to do is drink
it and talk about it.

847
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:27,116
If I give you 50 quid,
will you shut up about it?

848
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,886
I think it's wonderful.
I'm thrilled for you.

849
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:34,390
As I've always said,
there's dignity in honest toil.

850
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,726
I thought a gentleman
would "never sully himself

851
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,461
with anything
so vulgar as trade. "

852
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,963
( chuckles )

853
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:43,933
Tasting whiskey is not trade,
Alexandra, it's an art form.

854
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:48,137
I, like my lovely wife,
am an artist.

855
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,707
Aye. we all know
what sort of artist.

856
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,676
- Precise-
- ( chuckles )

857
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:58,848
They cut my line about
"highlands of the heart. "

858
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,184
I told you
it was cheesy.

859
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,019
It was not.
It was poetic.

860
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,787
It's still
a great review.

861
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:08,557
It is, isn't it?
And extremely well typed.

862
00:47:08,558 --> 00:47:12,295
Maybe you'll stop fretting about
our prospects, relax a little.

863
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:16,299
I will, when the books stop
bleeding all over my desk.

864
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,701
There you go again. How many
times do I have to tell you?

865
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:21,237
Glenbogle is not just a
business, it's our home.

866
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,306
<i>There you go again.</i>

867
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,841
Thanks to you, it'll be
a home for years to come.

868
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:29,345
- Thanks to you, too.
- We make quite a team.

869
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,547
Yep, me
as the brains-

870
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:33,682
I thought I
was the brains.

871
00:47:33,683 --> 00:47:38,221
You're the brawn. Thanks
for protecting me, Archie.

872
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:43,059
Sorry.

873
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,329
I thought you didn't want
to make the same mistakes.

874
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,767
There he is.
He's in here.

875
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:54,304
- What do you think?
- "Promising cooking"?

876
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:57,573
- What does it promise, exactly?
- "Venerable," Archie?

877
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,775
What's that supposed to mean?
It makes me sound senile.

878
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:02,378
"Molly's painting is full
of grace and serenity. "

879
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:06,115
If you think I wasted my three years
at the slade, why didn't you say so?

880
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:07,984
Hector: I'm not even mentioned!

881
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,619
